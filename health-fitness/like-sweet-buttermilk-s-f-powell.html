  <title>Like Sweet Buttermilk - S. F. Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First-place winner of the Black Expressions Fiction contest, Like Sweet Buttermilk is an erotically-charged exploration of infidelity, murder, and therapy, in a love story revisited.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Psychiatrist, Dr. Naomi Alexander, has a no-nonsense approach to everything&amp;mdash;except her personal life.

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Dr. Naomi Alexander, a psychiatrist, is the central and continuing fictional character in several works as she treats patients with varying degrees of psychological stress or trauma (not including her own). Plenty is revealed on her yellow counsel couch. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly painful&amp;mdash;but that&amp;rsquo;s what they&amp;rsquo;re there for.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Diminutive and with a gun close by, Naomi has a working relationship with the distilled beverages, and has a straightforward approach to all things other than her personal life.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Woven with recurring details unique to the series for fans of a little word-sleuthing, the novels explore perspectives from both sides of the couch, with elements of tension and angst and passion and laughter and interesting snapshots of the human drama that is life&amp;mdash;all flavored with gems of music both oldies and goodies, be it R&amp;amp;B, Soul, Classical, Gospel, or others.&lt;/li&gt;
