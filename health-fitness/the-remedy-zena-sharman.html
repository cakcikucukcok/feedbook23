  <title>The Remedy - Zena Sharman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To remedy means to heal, to cure, to set right, to make reparations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Remedy &lt;/I&gt;invites writers and readers to imagine what we need to create healthy, resilient, and thriving LGBTQ communities. This anthology is a diverse collection of real-life stories from queer and trans people on their own health-care experiences and challenges, from gay men living with HIV who remember the systemic resistance to their health-care needs, to a lesbian couple dealing with the experience of cancer, to young trans people who struggle to find health-care providers who treat them with dignity and respect. The book also includes essays by health-care providers, activists and leaders with something to say about the challenges, politics, and opportunities surrounding LGBTQ health issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both exceptionally moving and an incendiary call-to-arms, &lt;I&gt;The Remedy &lt;/I&gt;is a must-read for anyone&amp;#151;gay, straight, trans, and otherwise&amp;#151;passionately concerned about the right to proper health care for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributors include Amber Dawn, Sinclair Sexsmith, Francisco Ibanez-Carrasco, Cooper Lee Bombardier, Kara Sievewright, and Kelli Dunham.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Zena Sharman &lt;/B&gt;is a passionate advocate for queer and trans health. She has over a decade&#39;s experience in health research; currently she is Director of Strategy at the Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research. Zena is also co-editor of &lt;I&gt;Persistence: All Ways Butch and Femme&lt;/I&gt;. She lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
