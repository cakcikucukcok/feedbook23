  <title>Happiness Comes from Small Things - Madan Arora Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book offers a few simple ideas to be always happy. Does happiness require wealth, material objects-big houses, expensive and fancy cars, expensive diamonds and jewelry-big bank balance, awards and recognitions, and a large, highly recognized social circle of friends and acquaintances? No, the author believes. Quite to the contrary, happiness-in fact, lasting happiness-comes from simple things of life: a good family life, leisurely time spent with family and friends, having time to smell the roses and watch the sunset, doing everyday chores with full interest and dedication, and just by simple everyday living. While big, materialistic objects are transient, simple things are always there, waiting for us to be seen, touched, and enjoyed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book is timely as we seem to be complicating our lives and, by doing so, feeling stressed and unhappy by wishing more and more than what we really need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
