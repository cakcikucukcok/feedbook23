  <title>Entanglement - Emma Tarlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;When it&amp;#8217;s not attached to your head, your very own hair takes on a disconcerting quality. Suddenly, it is strange. And yet hair finds its way into all manner of unexpected places, far from our heads, including cosmetics, clothes, ropes, personal and public collections, and even food. Whether treated as waste or as gift, relic, sacred offering or commodity in a billion-dollar industry for wigs and hair extensions, hair has many stories to tell.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Collected from Hindu temples and Buddhist nunneries and salvaged by the strand from waste heaps and the combs of long-haired women, hair flows into the industry from many sources. Entering this strange world, Emma Tarlo travels the globe, tracking its movement across India, Myanmar, China, Africa, the United States, Britain and Europe, where she meets people whose livelihoods depend on hair. Viewed from inside Chinese wig factories, Hindu temples and the villages of Myanmar, or from Afro hair fairs, Jewish wig parlours, fashion salons and hair loss clinics in Britain and the United States, hair is oddly revealing of the lives of all it touches.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />

It is easy to read and packed full of interesting information. The book appeals to readers with specialist interests and wider curiosities in hair to read whole and dip in and out of. It is a personal, but not personalised, journey into and around the world of hair.<br /><b><i>Entanglement: The Secret Lives of Hair: Tarlo, Emma ...</i></b> | Emma Tarlo's book on hair is certainly interesting, and at times captivating. However, I found myself initially confused about the purpose of the book. I knew it was about hair, but at no point did the author mention what he wanted this book to be about, which is usually pretty common for non-fiction, and helpful for anthropological texts.<br /><b><i>Entanglement: The Secret Lives of Hair by Emma Tarlo</i></b> | Entanglement by Emma Tarlo - Winner of the Victor Turner Prize for Ethnographic Writing 2017 Journeying around the globe, through past and present, Emma Tarlo...<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Entanglement - Emma Tarlo</a> </h3></p><hr/>
