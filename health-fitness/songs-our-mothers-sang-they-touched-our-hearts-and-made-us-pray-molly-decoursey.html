      <meta name="description" content="What a journey this will be in remembering the &quot;Songs Our Mothers&#39; Sang that touched our hearts and made us pray.  Many of you will learn to praise God through song and there are many of you who will find it necessary to sing along and add a new song. 
This writing will open the door for those of you who want to learn how to pray from the heart in humility by just talking to Jesus as your friend.   Some of you will pray more fervent as you go to the throne of Grace believing and trusting in God with a newness.  Stay on the Path!
Songs our Mothers Sang is a tribute to those who have poured invaluable Christian teachings into the lives of so many of us.  As we continue to travel on this journey, may we always remember those who gave so much to assure our foundation.
