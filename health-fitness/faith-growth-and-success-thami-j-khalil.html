  <title>Faith, Growth and Success - Thami J. Khalil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many, including believers, confine faith and religion practice to rituals and actions focused on the hereafter. By doing this, they may overlook the fact that the growth and success of Islam in particular could not go through centuries, cultures changes, without using leadership and management principles embedded in its teachings. Surats of Coran, Hadiths of the Prophet Mohamed (saas), and bibliographies of early leaders of Islam are full of concepts such as time management, quality management, people management, message design, excellence in execution, etc. The cultural distance between these centuries old concepts and modern management and leadership approaches is much smaller than one may imagine. These concepts and examples of their effective applications are available in open sources, accessible to everybody from all ages. Similar concepts are nowadays taught in Master of Business Administration or in expensive corporate management courses. This makes the distance from success and growth very small for those who recognise these concepts as early as possible in the practice of their faith and religion and apply them in their daily lives.
