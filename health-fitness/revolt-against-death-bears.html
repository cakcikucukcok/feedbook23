      <meta name="description" content="The book is written from the premise that Satan, the murderer from the beginning (John 8:44), is out in full force to destroy life as created by God.  To counter this attack, God initiated a Revolt against Death in the sending of His Son  Jesus assumed patronage for this revolt in John 11:25-26:
I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die.
In order for humans to live eternally, God made man into a New Creature (2 Cor 5:17), but this time round the blueprint for this image is His Son, Christ Jesus!  
Adams deep sleep, wherein Eve was formed out of his opened side, is a symbol of Christs death and the parallel for the creation of the Spiritual Spouse  the Church and its offspring.  As with Adam, Jesus side was opened during His sleep (cf John 19:33-34) after which His body and blood became the substance of the New Creature." />
