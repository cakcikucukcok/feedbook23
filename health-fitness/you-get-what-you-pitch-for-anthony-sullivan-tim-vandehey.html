  <title>You Get What You Pitch For - Anthony Sullivan, Tim Vandehey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;                TV&#39;s most popular pitchman reveals the secrets of pitching to get what you want in virtually any situation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anthony &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan went from selling car washers in rainy Welsh street markets to selling to audiences of millions around the world as the face of OxiClean. How did he do it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Convincing people to give you what you want is an art form that takes charisma and confidence. But no great pitchman achieves success based on those quali­ties alone. The good ones make themselves great with practice and discipline, mastering a series of skills that Sullivan dubs the ten &quot;Pitch Powers.&quot; These are essen­tial techniques he&#39;s learned in more than twenty-five years &quot;on the joint&quot; (that&#39;s pitchman-speak for the area where you&#39;re selling). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the first time ever, Sullivan reveals the secrets behind his seemingly superhuman ability to persuade others--even if they start out regarding you with sus­picion or even hostility. Do it right and you&#39;ll change minds, open doors, get opportunities, turn adversar­ies into allies, make more money, and gain the kind of confidence that makes other people want to know you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the first Pitch Power (&quot;Know Your Acceptable Outcomes&quot;) to the last (&quot;Finish with Confidence&quot;)--with invaluable strategies along the way on using your flubs to get a laugh, how to deal with push-back, and more--Sullivan reveals that pitching is all about engaging a person face-to-face and eye-to-eye so they feel like you&#39;re speaking directly to them, even if there are fifty other people in the room. It&#39;s turning a crowd of strangers with their arms folded into a legion of fans ready to say &quot;yes&quot; enthusiastically to whatever you propose, what Anthony Sullivan calls &lt;i&gt;fierce agree­ment&lt;/i&gt;. It&#39;s the power to get the job, get the girl (or guy), get the part, make money, get better service, advance your career--do just about anything you want to do. &lt;br&gt;" />
