  <title>Truth in Dating - Susan Campbel, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Millions of single people — whether never married or divorced — put a lot of energy into meeting and dating new people, but because they don&#39;t invest their true selves, their efforts often go nowhere. To counter this trend, Susan M. Campbell presents an approach to dating that many consider radical: Be honest about yourself and ask for what you want, up front.
Campbell shows people how to have fun by flirting truthfully; date without getting ahead of the relationship; enjoy the freedom of being themselves; relate to their dates with honesty; realistically examine what a romantic partner can — and can&#39;t — offer in the way of fulfillment and happiness; and move forward when the time is right, or say goodbye if it&#39;s not working. On the way to finding the love of their lives, readers gain the tools they need to successfully manage the entire process." />
