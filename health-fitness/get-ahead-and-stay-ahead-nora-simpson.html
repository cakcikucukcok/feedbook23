  <title>Get Ahead and Stay Ahead - Nora Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Praise for Get Ahead &amp; Stay Ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nora is the greatest financial teacher I have ever experienced. By following the principles outlined in her book, I was able to quadruple my income in three years.
Barry Keating, Tony-Award Nominated Broadway Composer
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Nora Simpson had a huge positive impact on my professional life, helping me land a dream job leading an exciting high-tech growth business. I was delighted to discover that Nora brought the same wisdom, warmth, humor and can-do spirit to her new book that she brings to her live coaching. Get Ahead and Stay Ahead is a must-read for anyone who knows instinctively that they can have a more successful and rewarding career but just needs a little help along the way. Nora combines cutting-edge brain science with practical advice that is accessible to everyone from the entry-level job-seeker to the Executive Suite. Nora is an original and not to be missed.
David Lampert, President, HotDocs Corporation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Nora Simpsons charming, witty, and crucial collection of insights on navigating the working world is a must-read for anyone joining the workforce, from recent college graduates to more seasoned professionals. &lt;/p&gt;
