  <title>Pilgrimage Toward Freedom - Nancy Kautz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There comes a time, often in mid-life, when the years of accumulated life experiences come together in a crescendo of personal change: shifting values, disorientation, insecurity, feelings of solitude and often a deep questioning of identity. The transition is rarely graceful and easy. It soon becomes clear that some kind of &lt;I&gt;surrender&lt;/I&gt; is required, but how to actually &quot;let go&quot;? What are the obstacles in the way, and how can one begin to overcome them?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, our Western culture typically regards such life transitions as abnormal, even &quot;sick,&quot; and the common advice is to &quot;get treated,&quot; suppress the symptoms with drugs, and just try to cope. These changes are rarely seen as an important opportunity for expansion and self-understanding.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This little book is one woman&#39;s intimate record of her struggle through this maelstrom. It is unique and powerful, mainly because of the internal guidance process she relied upon to help her through it: a lively and compassionate dialogue of her inner-self talking with her outer-self. In the intensity and stress of modern life, few of us take advantage of this powerful approach to self-inquiry. With intention, practice and a purpose, it may serve as strong mental nourishment and trustful guidance-as it did with Nancy. She shows you here how it works.&lt;/p&gt;" />
