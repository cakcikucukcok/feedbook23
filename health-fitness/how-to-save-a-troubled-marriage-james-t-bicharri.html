      <meta name="description" content="Do you need to save your troubled marriage? It is possible you can save your marriage and develop a lifelong love! If you are having trouble in your marriage, you are not alone! Sometimes feeling as if you are the only person in the entire world who is or that you have no choice but to simply leave everything as it is and hope that it will somehow get better on its own. Marital problems will not miraculously vanish by themselves, but you are not alone, and your situation is not hopeless!
This book is designed to help you overcome your marital problems. There are a number of very important reasons why this book is for you...
This book focuses on resolving problems, rather than the modern slant of placing blame. This book is not about pointing out who is in the wrong or who has made mistakes-- it is about resolving what is negative in your marriage and building on what is positive! It does not focus on one specific area, but covers the scope of problems which are universal to marriages everywhere. It also takes into consideration that you and your spouse are individuals, and encourages you to approach each topic from an individual viewpoint. 
In this book, you will find a wealth of valuable informationIt is, without a doubt, the one book you need!  Whether you have been married for a short period of time, or a number of decades; whether you have been facing serious difficulties or merely wish to improve your marriage, this book is for you!
What else makes it different and better?
In addition, a very important and very unique factor in HOW TO SAVE A TROUBLED MARRIAGE is that it shows you how to look at the big picture!  Your marriage did not begin yesterday, nor did the problems which you are now encountering, nor did the little fleeting moments of happiness which you are occasionally experiencing! This book is unique because it guides you through the stages of your marriage, from the ideals and strengths which you can recall from your early days, through revitalizing your dreams and goals for the future!" />
