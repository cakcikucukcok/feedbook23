  <title>An Angelic Toolkit for the Spiritual Traveller - Mhairi Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An Angelic Toolkit for the Spiritual Traveller is an aid to the exploration of the divine qualities within all in this universe.  This book explores the energies present that we must become aware of and work with as we journey along our path, opening and growing spiritually along the way.    
Knowing where to go and what to explore is one of the big challenges to those who have just begun their spiritual journey.  This is a simple and basic guide to exploring and playing with all of the subjects covered and offers a starting point for the personal spiritual journey.
The toolkit nature of the book is intended to support and guide as you explore each topic in your own time.  It is a practical manual to explore, develop, and grow at your own pace, working with your own eternal spirit and the wonderful energy of Source and the angels.  
You can dip in and out of the book and be drawn to whatever resonates at a given time, rather than work through from front to back.  Throughout the book the reader can call upon the help of the angels, through prayer, meditation, and visualisation." />
