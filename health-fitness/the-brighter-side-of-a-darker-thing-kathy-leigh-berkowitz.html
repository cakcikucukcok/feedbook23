  <title>The Brighter Side of a Darker Thing - Kathy Leigh Berkowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Brighter Side of a Darker Thing
is a testimony of one womans journey of healing from sexual abuse. Kathy Leigh Berkowitz takes a final step toward her healing in the public telling of her life and her recovery from her past, ending with a bold resolve to continue sharing her story, in hopes that others likewise may find healing. Fallout from abuse often leaves behind broken pieces of a shattered self-esteem and many questions about the why. The author explores her own feelings and shares her innermost thoughts, while encouraging the reader with Scriptures to allow the Holy Spirit to do His perfect work, the strengthening of the inner soul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathy Leigh also faced numerous other challenges, including the death of her baby sister, her mothers mental illness, her fathers post-traumatic stress disorder, time spent in a Texas orphanage, poverty, and suicidal thoughts. The Brighter Side of a Darker Thing includes triumphant moments, her awards for various high school beauty pageants, the births of her four children, and the eventual path that led her to a full-time career in journalism. The Brighter Side of a Darker Thing is proof that a persons past doesnt define who they are, and that no matter the pain, there is hope and healing in Jesus. It is the authors belief that healing from sexual abuse is a lifelong journey, but along the way, there will be much cause to celebrate, especially when one walks through the portal of forgiveness.&lt;p&gt;" />
