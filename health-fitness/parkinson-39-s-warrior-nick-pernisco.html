  <title>Parkinson&#39;s Warrior - Nick Pernisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nick Pernisco was busy with a promising academic career when one day he noticed his left arm had stiffened and become immobile. After two years of tests, he was eventually diagnosed with Young-Onset Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s Disease at age 33. He fell into a deep depression and hit rock bottom, nearly losing everything. This is the story of what came next. Determined to turn his life around, Nick learned all he could about Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s, including everything about the benefits and side effects of Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s medications, the potential and limitations of natural therapies, the importance of proper nutrition, and the need for physical and emotional fitness. He began eating better, exercising regularly, and re-engaging with society. He changed his thinking about life and disease and adopted a positive attitude. He began fighting back with a warrior mentality. It worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In PARKINSON&amp;#39;S WARRIOR, Nick shows that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to give up your dreams because your body is not working as it should. He tells the story of how he came to terms with Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s and shows that, through fitness, community, and positivity, the path is open for all People With Parkinson&amp;#39;s to live better, happier, and healthier lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
