  <title>Engage! - Philippe Crinelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine that you step onto a boat cruising to a tropical island. Sweet coconuts, shiny lagoons, white sandy beaches... But to your surprise, day after day, you realize that the air is getting colder and colder, until you find out on a freezing morning, that, instead of tropical birds, resting on coconut palms, you have a flock of penguins staring at you on an immaculate white iceberg...! What happened? Was the Purpose of the trip unclear? Were the Processes applied to drive the boat inefficient? Were the People on board ineffective? Was the captain a liar? Or was it that you, as the Pilot of your life, left it up to other people to make what matters most to you a reality?... Isnt that how our lives sometimes end up looking as we drift through our roles? We want a lagoon and we end up with an iceberg... What are we going to do then? Be a victim and whine? Passively adapt to the cold? Consider that an iceberg isnt that bad after all? Or engage as the true Pilot of our life and set it back on track?
Which attitudes do we need to develop to ensure that well achieve the results that we want? What do we need to make the systems we share with others effective - teams, organizations, families? What does it cost to be an Engaged Pilot?" />
