  <title>Nobody With Something to Say - Phil Pease</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every day, ideas, thoughts, and oberservations pop into our heads, but we rarely share them with others. When we do, we often hear something like, &quot;What does it matter?&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m sure the experts would disagree&quot; or &quot;You didn&#39;t go to school for that so how would you know?&quot; In Nobody with Something to Say, Phil Pease shares a collection of essays bound together by a common theme: The world would be a better place if we cultivated thoughts and ideas instead of surrendering the terrain to &quot;experts&quot;-as if they are the only ones who have worthwhile thoughts. His essays liberate random thoughts that challenge the notion that meaningful contributions require gargantuan credentials, external validation, and money. Each essay ends with a small but potent open-ended question: &quot;What do you think?&quot; So the next time a random thought or idea jumps into your head, don&#39;t let it shrivel away. Let it develop, and while it does, tell the world." />
