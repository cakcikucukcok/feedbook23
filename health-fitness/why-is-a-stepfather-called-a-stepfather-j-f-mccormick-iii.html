  <title>Why Is a Stepfather Called a Stepfather? - J. F. McCormick Iii</title>

In Why Is A Stepfather Called A Stepfather? J. F. McCormick, III., focuses on the stepfather because it seems as though the majority of stepparent homes are headed by stepfathers. He then differentiates between the bad stepfather and the good stepfather. The latter being the one who deserves a lot of praise but rarely receives it because society lumps the good in with the bad and looks down on both. The good stepfather deserves much praise because he is constantly exposed to problems with the children and many times with his wife that the biological father dont have to face. Problems like being told: Youre not my father! You cant tell me what to do! Problems like being told: Youre not their father! You cant spank them! Gods special love for stepfathers comes to view as He arranged for Moses and Jesus to be raised by stepfathers!&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
