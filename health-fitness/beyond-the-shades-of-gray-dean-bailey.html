  <title>Beyond the Shades of Gray - Dean Bailey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Shades of Gray is based upon Christian fundamentals and beliefs. It was not written to convince anyone that homosexuality is &quot;wrong.&quot; It was written primarily to assist those who are inwardly convinced that their own homosexuality is &quot;wrong for them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over 10 years in the personal journey of its writing, the author uses practical applications of Bible scripture throughout the book, without religiosity. Scripture is used to confront various aspects of this very controversial subjecthead-on. Therefore, the author makes no apologies for the portions of this book that may seem to be more graphic in nature than your average Christian book. Homosexuality is a subject that absolutely needs to be dealt with truthfully, and without religious avoidance of difficult topics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are a person who has ever had doubts or questions about your sexual orientation or behavior, then what the author has written here is for you. The work contains a wealth of practical, biblical principles, and also includes information for women. But the book is otherwise a work written by a man, for other men who also desire freedom and heterosexual restoration from their own unwanted homosexual behaviors. &lt;i&gt;&quot;What we long for is a deep and heartfelt sense of brotherhood,&quot;&lt;/i&gt; and the author proposes that the real issues behind homosexual behaviors are not about sex!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gods love (agpe love) always has both a balance of truth, and a responsibility that goes along with it. In this book, I take the same agpe love approach toward homosexuality, as Jesus did in the Book of John, Chapter 8, with the woman caught in the sin of adultery. Jesus showed great love and compassion toward the woman, both in the way that he dealt with the hypocritical crowd that had brought her to him, and in the way he spoke to her as he sent her on her way, and told her, Go, and sin no more.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; - Dean Bailey&lt;/p&gt;" />
