  <title>At the Feet of Serenity - Eve Gwartney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1934 Grace photographed her favorite statue, a national monument named Serenity: The Statue of Friendship. 
Throughout the decades Serenitys destruction, caused by vandals, parallels the destruction in Graces family because she died leaving behind five young children. Destruction in the family comes just as it comes to many families struggling to make everything right in a world full of mistrust, selfishness and defiance. Social injustice weighs heavily upon Henry, the widower and Derek, his divorced son.
Derek, the main character, is introduced in the beginning of the story and becomes the focus of the family drama. As an adult he will defy social norms and embrace an unconventional lifestyle: polygamy.
The family attempts to adhere to their Mormon faith as they face the challenges of parenthood and poverty. Serenity suffers and becomes symbolic of Hope for Restoration.
Throughout the decades, Serenity remains stalwart and unwavering through strife, stationary upon the spot that her government assigned her.
Join the Claylands through their ups and downs; and learn important truths about the need to feel acceptance, the complexities of unconventional families, the consequences of poverty, and imbalance of employment opportunity. At the Feet of Serenity." />
