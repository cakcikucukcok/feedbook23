  <title>What Mothers Never Tell Their Daughters - Michelle Deering, Abigail Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wishing you had less tension in your relationship with your daughter?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Desiring a closer relationship with your daughter?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Longing for your mom to just &amp;ldquo;get&amp;rdquo; you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;quot;What Mothers Never Tell Their Daughters&amp;quot;, Dr. Michelle Deering supportively guides you through the 5 Keys that will give you a clearer picture of what your mom or daughter may not be able to express.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the daughter of an immigrant single mom, Michelle experienced the effects of having a mother who spent the majority of her time working hard to survive and make ends meet. Expectations were many but unspoken. Family dynamics were volatile and tenuous but not discussed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Broken relationships were prevalent in Michelle&amp;rsquo;s life, but she was determined to earn her doctorate in counseling psychology and become a licensed clinical psychologist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, Michelle elegantly brings together her experiences as a daughter, mother of twin daughters, and psychologist as she looks into the mirror of her life and reflects on the struggles she has experienced as well as the difficulties that her clients have overcome. She meets her readers as if at a caf&amp;eacute; table, candidly sharing those reflections with insightful clarity that sheds light on their personal situations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What Mothers Never Tell Their Daughters&amp;quot; gives you sage strategies and practical tools to help you navigate and improve your mother&amp;ndash;daughter relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
