  <title>Diary of a Dying Aids Patient: Death by Betrayal - Shirl A. Jefferson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As an only child of a devout Christian couple, Kelly is raised to become the kind of daughter any parent would be proud of. Every choice she makes is grounded on the values and lessons her parents instilled in her. Kelly has a steadfast hold on her beliefs, one of which is to give herself only to the man she will marry. Her boyfriend believes otherwise and when Kelly refuses to give in to his desires, he leaves her for another woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kellys attempts to get over her heartbreak and establish a successful business both fail. She decides to take her chance in New York where a job as a real estate broker awaits. Living a fastpaced life lifts Kellys mind off her previous disappointment. With a great job and a more luxurious life, all Kelly needs is a man who will love and respect her. Kevin, an investment banker, enters Kellys life and they immediately fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Married life suits both Kelly and Kevin, until an undisclosed part of Kevins past comes out in the open. Upon learning that she has been infected with HIV, Kelly finds out that Kevin had been in a homosexual relationship with a man who has AIDS. With the disease taking a toll on Kellys body, Kevin decides to end their marriage and go on with their lives separately. Betrayed and brokenhearted, Kelly goes back home to her parents, where she spends the remaining days of her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
