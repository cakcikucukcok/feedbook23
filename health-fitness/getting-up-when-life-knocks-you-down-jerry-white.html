  <title>Getting Up When Life Knocks You Down - Jerry White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The loss of a loved one, a bitter divorce, a serious injury or financial crisis--we must all, at some point, face those unavoidable moments that divide our lives into &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after.&quot; How do we muscle through tough times and emerge stronger, wiser--even grateful for our struggle? In 1984, author Jerry White lost his leg in a tragic accident. He has personally endured the pain of loss and the challenge of rebuilding.  As cofounder of Survivor Corps, White has met thousands of victims of tragedy. With his book &lt;i&gt;Getting Up When Life Knocks You Down&lt;/i&gt;, he shares what he has learned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;White outlines a specific five-step program for turning tragedy into triumph.  In their own words, his survivor friends share their stories. It&#39;s a group that includes the well known, like Lance Armstrong, Nelson Mandela, and the late Princess Diana, and also everyday survivors of death, loss, injury and heartbreak. Through their stories and the author&#39;s words, this book takes readers step by step through the process of not only surviving tragedy and victimhood, but going on to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
