  <title>Positive Options for Living with COPD - Teri Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;The diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be devastating. It&amp;#8217;s important to note, though, that while COPD is debilitating, it is not a death sentence. With proper disease management, people with COPD can expect to live a full and happy life. While there are no magic pills or quick fixes, there are many things COPD sufferers can do to have more energy, less shortness of breath, and an overall better quality of life despite breathlessness or use of home oxygen. This comprehensive guide helps people in any stage of COPD learn to work with their physical limitations rather than against them. Compassionate and clearly written, it covers every aspect of the disease, including the psychological and emotional issues that go along with having COPD, medications and physical therapy, identifying triggers and warning signs, creating an action plan for worsening symptoms, techniques to make breathing easier, working with healthcare providers, and much more.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
