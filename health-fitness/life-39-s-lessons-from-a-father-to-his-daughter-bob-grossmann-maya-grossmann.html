  <title>Life&#39;s Lessons from a Father to His Daughter - Bob Grossmann, Maya Grossmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life&#39;s Lessons from a Father to his Daughter&lt;/i&gt; uses twenty-four stories, pictures and artwork to help teach our children life&#39;s lessons with the aim of helping our children learn to make good decision-making skills.  Decision-making skills are often not well taught or integrated into a strong sense of personal philosophy.  Human nature can be impulsive. 
&lt;p&gt;
The use of stories (real life or metaphors) to pass on life lessons from one generation to another is at the core of our oral and written traditions. Parents can help to pass on this information as a creative way to install core values, help reduce the chance of mishap, and enhance lifelong success. 
&lt;p&gt;
Part of the challenge is establishing a dialogue that allows worldviews to be discussed: both the commonalties and the differences. Perhaps part of the failure to achieve a sustained dialogue is that we as parents wait too long to start the dialogue.   
&lt;p&gt;
Part of the challenge, too, is that the lessons have different levels of meaning as we age. So &lt;i&gt;Life&#39;s Lessons from a Father to his Daughter&lt;/i&gt; was written to have meaning at the different stages of life: in one&#39;s mid-teens, mid-twenties, and again in mid-life. Value exists in the stories being real. Non-fiction can carry more weight. Children need to learn early that their parents continue to go through what they are experiencing. We, too, make mistakes, that we try and fail, and we are both individuals and members of larger communities. 
&lt;p&gt;
All the increasing access to information may not make decision-making easier. Greater discrimination and better choices will be essential. So, read the vignettes with your children and see where the discussion goes.  Be sure to have a few good laughs along the way! &lt;i&gt;Life&#39;s Lessons from a Father to his Daughter&lt;/i&gt; is a tool to help parents communicate with their children by providing a context for parents to add their own personal stories." />
