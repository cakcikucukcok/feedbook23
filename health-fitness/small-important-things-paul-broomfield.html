  <title>Small Important Things - Paul Broomfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The unasked, unanswered (and quite possibly unconscious) question on most males minds is How do I become a man? or Where do I begin? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take Daniel Shaughnessy, for example. By conventional standards, the thirty-one-year-old was successful and had everything he needed to be happy. Except for happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internally, he was emotionally unfulfilled and incapable of meaningful intimate relationships; suffering from a subtle but consistent melancholic ignorance as to why he felt melancholic in the first place; plagued by a persistent lament: Oh, God, why cant this all just cease? It was a silent humiliation, not always in the spotlight, but definitely lurking in the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when one chance encounter presented another option to stop the suffering? Well, then Daniel came face to face with the fears, insecurities, and doubts that were at the heart of his ache. Because we find that sometimes the greatest obstacle and enemy of a rich and satisfying life  is our own self. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in the beautiful, bustling, and eclectic city of Montreal, Quebec, Small Important Things is an educational journey through the life of a man who didnt quite feel like a man but had a deep-seated desire to initiate himself into manhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if the question Where do I begin to become a man? resonates, then the answer is, ding-dongright here.&lt;/p&gt;" />
