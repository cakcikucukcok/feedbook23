  <title>Fresh Start: The Step-by-Step Journey to Rebuild and Renew Your Life - Vivian Jokotade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Fresh Start is Possible, You Only Need to Know How&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Could you use a fresh start in your finances, your career, your business, your marriage, your relationships, your family, your habits or your health? An early step towards a fresh start is identifying that specific area. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve identified that area, the next question you may have is, &amp;ldquo;How?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In Fresh Start, Jokotade teaches that a fresh start is more than a sudden occurrence, and more than a wish. A fresh start is a process. A fresh start is a journey - a journey that requires a plan.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Through stories from her life and the experiences of others, Jokotade provides you a compelling, easy to follow guide with steps to consider on your journey beginning right where you are.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Discover the 5 Essential principles you need to get back on track and move forward. You&amp;#39;ll be inspired to dream and reach for the life you were born to live. The reality is none of us got to choose how we were born or even the names we were given at birth, but we can choose how we end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You no longer have to guess, wish and hope with no success. You can make a fresh start. You only need to know how.&lt;/p&gt;" />
