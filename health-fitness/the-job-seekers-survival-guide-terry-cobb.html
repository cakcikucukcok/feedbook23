The author, Terry Cobb, spent thirty  years in the world of recruiting and human resources.  The total of these years combined working within the military, the federal government, the mortgage industry, headhunting IT (Information Technology) professionals, the banking world, inside and outside sales and the housing market.  He&#39;s recruited for positions in aviation, engineering, medical, information technology, communications, sales, management, construction, human resources and others, ranging from entry level to senior level management.  Terry has reviewed literally thousands of resumes and interviewed many of those prospects telephonically and in person.
