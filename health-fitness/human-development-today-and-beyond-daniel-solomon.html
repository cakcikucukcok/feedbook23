Many social problems that we face today such as a lack of adequate skills, jobs, family unity, and morality are addressed, and solutions are offered. Metaphysical and Spiritual concepts once deemed mysterious or off limits are broken down and made to be easily understood. The spiritual knowledge in this book is tangible, and can be applied daily to enrich happiness and contentment within the soul." />
