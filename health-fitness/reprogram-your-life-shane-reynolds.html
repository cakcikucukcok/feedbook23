  <title>Reprogram Your Life - Shane Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this modern-day book &quot;Reprogram your LIFE&quot; Shane Reynolds reveals through the application of reprogramming your inner belief systems and upgrading your frequencies a path to successfully gaining financial and emotional security. It is Shane&#39;s philosophy that &quot;there is nothing as powerful as a changed mind. You can change your looks, your clothing, your address, your partner, your residence or your investment strategy, but if you don&#39;t change your mind, the same experience will perpetuate over and over again. This is because everything outwardly can be changed, but it means nothing without an inward transformation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t let this year&#39;s vision board be another should list! What changes people is when your should becomes a must, when suddenly the thing you should have becomes a must have, unless you take some new action and start thinking some new thoughts and install some of the new programming that will work, nothing will change! Act now and let the reprogramming transform your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers of this book have said &quot;Reprogram your LIFE is a reality check that prepares the reader for the brutal truth of life&quot; other readers have said &quot;Do not read this book unless you are willing to discover what has really been holding you back&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shane Reynolds Author and Motivational Speaker based on the Gold Coast in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
