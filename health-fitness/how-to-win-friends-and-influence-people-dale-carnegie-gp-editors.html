&lt;strong&gt;Dale Carnegie&lt;/strong&gt; (1888&amp;ndash;1955) was an American writer and lecturer and the developer of famous courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking and interpersonal skills.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
He was born in an impoverished family in Maryville, Missouri. Carnegie harboured a strong love and passion for public speaking from a very early age and was very proactive in debate in high school. During the early 1930&amp;rsquo;s, he was renowned and very famous for his books and a radio program. &amp;#39;When How to Win Friends and Influence People&amp;#39; was published in 1930, it became an instant success and subsequently became one of the biggest bestsellers of all time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Carnegie loved teaching others to climb the pillars of success. His valuable and tested advice was used in many domains and has been the inspiration of many famous people&amp;rsquo;s success. One of the core ideas in his books is that it is possible to change other people&amp;#39;s behavior by changing one&amp;#39;s reaction to them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
