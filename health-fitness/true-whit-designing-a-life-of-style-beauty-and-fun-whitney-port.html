      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney Port shares personal stories, beauty and fitness secrets, and tried-and-true advice on everything girls need to know to start their lives out with style&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fashion trendsetter, MTV reality star, and clothing designer Whitney Port learned to navigate her new independent life in New York with grace, style, and a sense of humor. From backstabbing coworkers and bitchy bosses to long-distance boyfriends and a daring new career in fashion, Whitney managed to handle it all.

Whitney also details what young women &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want to know, like what to eat when the mid-afternoon munchies strike, how to throw an impromptu party, and how to hide a hangover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With hundreds of photos and chock-full of must-have lists and style favorites, this colorful scrapbook features pics from Whitney&#39;s personal photo albums and from major moments in her life, including on the runway, at her private birthday bash, and out on the town with friends. And for the first time, Whitney shares the true reality of an emerging fashion designer, highlighting her creative process, sketches, and fabrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through personal stories and private snapshots, fans will get to see a side of her that the cameras don&#39;t capture.
