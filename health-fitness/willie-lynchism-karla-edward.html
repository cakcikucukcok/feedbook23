  <title>Willie Lynchism - Karla Edward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1998, I discovered a lesson I was never taught in school. It opened my eyes to the origin of the pain, dysfunction and devastation of a people who have been manipulated, bamboozled, deceived, denigrated, disparaged, maligned and premeditatedly victimized for centuries in America...for PROFIT.
It was a poignant Aha! moment for me.  I finally understood the angst and cognitive dissonance Id felt for years, as a Black woman growing up in the cradle of Civil War America---Petersburg, VA.  My spirit wouldnt let me rest until I had discovered Willie Lynchism.
Virginia is where much of U. S. His-Story began and where the most redoubtable of all U. S. wars ended.  Locations around Virginia endured battles and events that have shaped its modern day tourism and house painful memories of the formidable war that took place on U. S. soil between fellow Americans--The Civil War.  It thankfully, but according to some revisionists, coincidentally, ended American Slavery.  Revisionism aside, Willie Lynchism and the Lets Make a Slave plan, must be added to the National U. S. History Content Standards, if America is going to correct its faulty, racist ideologies." />
