  <title>The Dead Church - Jonathan Onche Edeh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the church falls short of being an excellent description of the Body of Christ, there is an urgent need for a reawakening. When the character of the church is no longer consistent with the character of Jesus Christ, the head of the Body of Christ, there is a need to sound the fire alarm. When the church can no longer influence its members and the world in doing what is scripturally right, but good and acceptable, there is an urgent need for a spirit-guided self-examination. When supposed church members are no longer guided or led by the spirit of God but the senses or the world, there is a need for transformation by the renewing of the mind. When church members can no longer tell the difference between the true gospel of Christ Jesus and the secular gospel both preached from the same Holy Bible, there is an urgent need to speak out to save many from the path of damnation. The focus of this work is not so much on those social and business empires branded churches but on the individual whose genuine spiritual state is hinged on a personal relationship with God. Everyone must press in." />
