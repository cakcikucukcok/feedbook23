  <title>Five Steps to Freedom - Phil Golding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you spend much of your time feeling unfulfilled, lonely, angry, anxious or depressed? Are you running on empty? Do you frequently find yourself with people who are not there for you, or do you cut yourself off for fear of being hurt? &lt;b&gt;5 Steps to Freedom&lt;/b&gt; reveals a sustainable pathway out of suffering and into self-confidence and peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is said that we must learn to emotionally stand on our own two feet before we can find fulfilment in our lives. This means knowing how to truly care for ourselves without depending on outside props that often trap us into unhealthy life-style choices or destructive relationships. This personal balance provides us with the confidence to step out into life and step in closer to other people without getting hurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;5 Steps to Freedom&lt;/b&gt; contains the key ingredients for emotional healing, inner peace, selfawareness and self-confidence. It introduces a set of clear and effective guidelines that show you how to take care of your own feelings and needs. It shows you how to create the life that you want. Fear and confusion can be transformed into a pathway to understanding and healing. You not only learn how to give to yourself, but you can have plenty left over to freely give to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the right understanding and the right approach, every situation, positive or negative, can be turned to your benefit. &lt;b&gt;5 Steps to Freedom&lt;/b&gt; shows you how to claim your potential and live it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
