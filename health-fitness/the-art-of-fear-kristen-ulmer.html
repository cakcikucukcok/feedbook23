  <title>The Art of Fear - Kristen Ulmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A revolutionary guide to acknowledging fear and developing the tools we need to build a healthy relationship with this confusing emotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and use it as a positive force in our lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all feel fear. Yet we are often taught to ignore it, overcome it, push past it. But to what benefit?&amp;#160; This is the essential question that guides Kristen Ulmer&amp;#8217;s remarkable exploration of our most misunderstood emotion in &lt;em&gt;The Art of Fear&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once recognized as the best extreme skier in the world (an honor she held for twelve years), Ulmer knows fear well. In this conversation-changing book, she argues that fear is not here to cause us problems&amp;#8212;and that in fact, the only true issue we face with fear is our misguided reaction to it (not the fear itself). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding our&amp;#160;experience with&amp;#160;fear from the ground up, Ulmer starts by exploring why we&amp;#8217;ve come to view it as a negative. From here, she unpacks fear and shows it to be just one of 10,000 voices that make up our reality, here to help us come alive alongside joy, love, and gratitude. Introducing a mindfulness tool called &amp;#8220;Shift,&amp;#8221; Ulmer teaches readers how to experience fear in a simpler, more authentic way, transforming our relationship with this emotion from that of a draining battle into one that&amp;#8217;s in line with our true nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Influenced by Ulmer&amp;#8217;s own complicated relationship with fear and her over 15 years as a mindset facilitator, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Fear &lt;/em&gt;will reconstruct the way we react to and experience fear&amp;#8212;empowering us to easily and permanently address the underlying cause of our fear-based problems, and setting us on course to live a happier, more expansive future. &lt;/p&gt;" />
