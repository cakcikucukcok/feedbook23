      <meta name="description" content="Discovery: The New Theory of Longevity 
by Mark Chak 
Several debilitating diseases plague the human race. Over the centuries, the study of the human body has evolved, resulting in numerous breakthroughs and discoveries. Unfortunately, the body has also evolved along with the many parasites that affect it. Even now in the twenty-first century, the deadliest and most common diseases, such as cancer, AIDS, Polypus, hemorrhoids, and heart disease, hold no cures that do not require invasive surgeries and procedures. 
In Discovery: New Theory of Longevity, Mark Chak provides an alternative to current procedures through the use of pressure, a naturally occurring phenomenon in nature. He believes isolating the environment around the parasites with either cold or heated pressure will eradicate the problem. In theory, by changing the environment, the parasite cannot survive and will die without harming the vital organs and tissue around it. The result: a longer, healthier life for the individual." />
