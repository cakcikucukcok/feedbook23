      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We live in a marketplace filled with valuable ideas for how to be happy, yet people continue to suffer. We are just now awakening to the principal source of our unhappiness and suffering, which is ego. Ego wreaks havoc in our daily lives, from the pain that individuals, couples, and families experience all the way up to global tensions and international conflict. Most people think of ego as an inflated sense of self-importance, but this is only a fraction of what it really is. Ego is the misidentification of who we are as beings. It drives us to think and behave in ways that are inconsistent and incongruent with whom we really are, leading always to dissatisfaction and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to finding happiness is to loosen ourselves from egos painful grip by going beyond ego and entering the world of Spiritthe source of true joy and peace. To do so, we must first travel through the ego. Without proper guidance, this trip can be perilous, because ego, to ensure its own survival, makes every attempt to derail us along the way. &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Ego&lt;/em&gt; is an easy-to-follow, step-by-step guide to help you make this journey safely. The seeds of happiness, joy, and peace of mind will take root at the outset of your journey and continue to grow every step of your way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
