&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;My Life Story is a powerful and inspiring message that will encourage, enrich any one in an abusive relationship seeking answers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Henrietta Trotter wrote Chapter 1-11 of her autobiography starting from the death of her mother at childbirth she says was Gods first intervention. He saved her twin and herself. It showed Gods Grace and Mercy when she sinned and fell short of His glory before she joined the Ministry. Her mothers name was Grace. Her story showed Gods Grace and Mercy before she accepted her calling.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Divine Intervention is divine instructions interceding and organizing your life by allowing you to overcome your fears. Its resilient proof that Love dont Hate and Hate dont Love. Life can be difficult. There always seems to be some obstacle or misfortune trying to offset the good. However, in those times this book wants people not to despair, but to relish Gods love and strength, which this book reinforces. In this book Elder Trotter says, My primary goal is to be used by God. This book reveals her quest for justice; chapter after chapter relates how she was attacked in different areas, but she learned how to withstand the storm that came without warning; this contributes to her success as she never excepted defeat, Trotter says. Jobs secret was not his struggle; we all struggle. It was his endurance. This book introduces Gods power and favor in every line and between every page it reveals His Glory!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;It confirms the promises made to Abraham that the seed shall be blessed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Elder Trotter wrote. She started writing just weeks after her brutal attack on October 20, 1991, but when she came to herself years later the land of milk and honey unfolded. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;She added. Writing my life story was a healing process for my deliverance.&lt;/P&gt;
