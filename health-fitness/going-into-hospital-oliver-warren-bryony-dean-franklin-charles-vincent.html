  <title>Going into hospital? - Oliver Warren, Bryony Dean Franklin, Charles Vincent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hospitals are a constant presence in the lives of many people. Almost everyone will visit or go into hospital at some point in their life. This can be a confusing experience: the environment is strange, the daily routine is unfamiliar and it is hard to understand the medical language. Going into hospital is, in many ways, like visiting a foreign country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is your guide to the foreign land of the hospital. It provides clear, practical information about how hospitals work, who the staff are and the investigations and treatments you may receive. The book helps you understand hospital-speak by translating it into straightforward English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has been written by a consultant surgeon, a pharmacist and a psychologist who have all worked in hospitals for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are better informed and can understand concepts like choice, risk and benefit, you can work more effectively wth your healthcare team to make the right decisions, and you will be better equipped to help yourself and your family. You will find this book an invaluable guide to a journey through the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;" />
