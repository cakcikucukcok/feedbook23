  <title>Cuss Control - James V. O’Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FINALLY-THE CURE FOR THE COMMON CURSE! Faced with an epidemic of profanity, our country is in need of practical suggestions for breaking a habit that has ordinary citizens contributing to the decline of civility and good manners. It&#39;s not always easy to resist the urge to cuss, but foul language creates an unfavorable image, is damaging to relationships, and goes hand-in-hand with a negative attitude.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Now, James V. O&#39;Connor-founder of the Cuss Control Academy-offers the first book to explain why we swear and how we can learn to hold our tongues. &lt;I&gt;Cuss Control&lt;/I&gt; doesn&#39;t call for the total elimination of swearing, just for its confinement to situations where extreme emotion (think hammer, think thumb) demand it. His program for easing us off the gutter-talk highway involves alternative &quot;potent phrases&quot; for classic curses, including the F-word; ways to communicate clearly rather than use lazy language; and tips on adjusting our attitude and abolishing obscenities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Packed with practical exercises and tips, as well as thoughtful reflection on how we&#39;ve worked ourselves up into such a state of affairs, &lt;I&gt;Cuss Control&lt;/I&gt; is a refreshing celebration of the joys of a civil tongue.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;O&#39;Connor is not ready to rid the world of dirty words. He just thinks less cursing is the key to a less stressful world, and maintains that even natural-born cursers can learn to control their anger along with their language.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
