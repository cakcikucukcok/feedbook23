  <title>My Fair Junkie - Amy Dresner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;Blackout &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Permanent Midnight&lt;/i&gt;, a darkly funny and revealing debut memoir of one woman&#39;s twenty-year battle with sex, drugs, and alcohol addiction, and what happens when she finally emerges on the other side.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Growing up in Beverly Hills, Amy Dresner had it all: a top-notch private school education, the most expensive summer camps, and even a weekly clothing allowance. But at 24, she started dabbling in meth in San Francisco and unleashed a fiendish addiction monster. Soon, if you could snort it, smoke it, or have sex with, she did.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Smart and charming, with Daddy&#39;s money to fall back on, she sort of managed to keep it all together. But on Christmas Eve 2011 all of that changed when, high on Oxycontin, she stupidly &quot;brandished&quot; a bread knife on her husband and was promptly arrested for &quot;felony domestic violence with a deadly weapon.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Within months, she found herself in the psych ward--and then penniless, divorced, and looking at 240 hours of court-ordered community service. For two years, assigned to a Hollywood Boulevard &quot;chain gang,&quot; she swept up syringes (and worse) as she bounced from rehabs to halfway houses, all while struggling with sobriety, sex addiction, and starting over in her forties.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the tradition of &lt;i&gt;Orange Is the New Black &lt;/i&gt;and Jerry Stahl&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Permanent Midnight&lt;/i&gt;, Amy Dresner&#39;s &lt;i&gt;My Fair Junkie &lt;/i&gt;is an insightful, darkly funny, and shamelessly honest memoir of one woman&#39;s battle with all forms of addiction, hitting rock bottom, and forging a path to a life worth living." />
