  <title>Mental Silence - Dr. Bertrand Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For more than 25 years, Dr. Bertrand Martin has been teaching meditation for combating stress and achieving overall better quality of life. In his new book, he talks about his techniques and how to use them to achieve &quot;Mental Silence&quot;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Today&#39;s society suffers from stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, negativity and much more, leading to unhappiness, diseases, consumption of medicaments and drugs,&quot; Dr Martin says. &quot;Regular practice of Mental Silence Meditation can prevent and cure many ailments. It also treads the path of full realization of one&#39;s potential.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although stress is a normal part of life, too much of it can have debilitating consequences.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Martin, a psychiatrist and ayurvedic physician, has been teaching meditation to his patients since 1990. This has helped about 95 percent of his patients experience mental silence, a feeling he describes as &quot;a totally peacefully state of consciousness in which thinking process stops and a deep physical and mental relaxation is experienced.&quot; He shares his techniques for achieving mental silence in his eponymous book. It is specially written for people living busy, fast-paced lives who 
want to meditate efficiently and achieve fast results. The steps shared are practical, measurable, clearly explained, and easy to practice.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Bertrand Piccard, Psychiatrist and explorer recommends the method: &quot;If you have picked up this book, it probably means that the search for pioneering solutions to further improve your quality of life is a matter that excites your curiosity. Not all of us can be discoverers of the universe, but we can go a long way just by exploring our own selves. Our mind is the richest, most valuable and most efficient resource that is permanently available to each of us. Dr Martin is proposing a conscious and serene method to shape up our mental, spiritual and physical capacities. The method is simple, fast and effective. Let yourself go and you may land way beyond your usual certainties.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;" />
