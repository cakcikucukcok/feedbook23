  <title>Barefoot Doctor&#39;s Handbook for the Urban Warrior - Barefoot Doctor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This Handbook represents the author&amp;rsquo;s impression (so far) of an ancient system, Taoism, which, though Chinese in origin, is universal in its application and which he now desires, for both altruistic and self-seeking reasons, to share with you, the reader. The relationship you are about to begin with it could constitute a major experiment with your reality. It is written primarily for your enjoyment, both in the reading and in the after-effect on your life. It contains some pretty heavy stuff and is therefore best treated lightly with a peck of pickled pepper. Though it happens to contain all the information you need to install the warrior&amp;rsquo;s mind set in your circuitry, the information is presented so as to entertain you and therefore facilitate easy absorption. This is no mere two-dimensional intellectual explanation (literally a laying out flat on a plain) of a system, but is in fact a total &amp;lsquo;sensaround&amp;rsquo; four-dimensional interactive reading experience. I am appealing to your true intelligence which lies behind your intellect, the intelligence of your body. Dimension three is introduced by placing the ideas in the context of your &amp;lsquo;everyday&amp;rsquo; life. Dimension four comes into play during the process of unfoldment you may experience as the information itself unfolds over time. If you follow the material in sequence, its silken thread will guide you to a full understanding of the Taoist warrior &amp;lsquo;system&amp;rsquo; almost without your realising it&amp;rsquo;s happening. If you let click randomly on any page you can use it as a personal oracle or magical counsellor to give you the answer to whichever question is on your mind, to give you a portion of friendly company, a little chuckle and a spot of up-lift to help you on your way. Focus on whatever&amp;rsquo;s bothering you most at the moment, then once you have read this passage, close your eyes and the Handbook. Now let the Handbook fall open at any page and read that page. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;ll give you some elucidation on your situation, perhaps it won&amp;rsquo;t. But may you receive ten thousand benefits from the reading of it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
