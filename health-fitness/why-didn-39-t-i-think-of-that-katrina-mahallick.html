Offended.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All of these have different meanings to each of us individually because of what we were taught. Each individual has their own perception of what is going on in &amp;lsquo;their world.&amp;rsquo; Why do you do what you do? Why do you think the way you think? Even though change is constant, people adapt to the changes at their own pace, and they are where they are because of how they were taught and what they believe about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A broad mix of others&amp;rsquo; beliefs of what words mean to them, &lt;em&gt;Why Didn&amp;rsquo;t I Think of That?&lt;/em&gt; will peel back the layers of who you truly are in this moment. It will trigger your past accomplishments, failures, hurts, and beliefs that were instilled into your subconscious by others.&lt;em&gt; Why Didn&amp;rsquo;t I Think of That?&lt;/em&gt; is a book that will not only make you think of what you want to obtain in life, but it will make you reflect on who you really are, why you are the way you are, how you became who you are today, and what you have to look forward to for the rest of your life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Everyone really can have everything they want, but it all begins and ends with you, the individual.&lt;/p&gt;" />
