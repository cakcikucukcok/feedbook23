  <title>Bullies and the Three Monkeys: How the Vicious Cycle Can Be Broken - Peter W. Schroeder, Dagmar Schroeder-Hildebrand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the authors of Kar-Ben&#39;s award-winning &lt;i&gt;Six Million Paper Clips: The Making of a Children&#39;s Holocaust Memorial&lt;/i&gt;, comes a book about teaching the lessons of tolerance gleaned from the Holocaust. &lt;br&gt;In &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bullies and the Three Monkeys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Peter W. Schroeder and Dagmar Schroeder-Hildebrand, searching for lessons to be learned from the Holocaust, discover the &quot;Pyramid of Hate,&quot; in which seemingly small acts of intolerance, such as bullying, can mushroom into unspeakable tragedy. &lt;br&gt;More than half of all children in North America have to endure emotional and physical violence. A lot of these victims, some as young as nine years, see only one way out, they commit suicide. &lt;br&gt;The Schroeders have spent years talking to students, parents, educators, experts and government agencies mainly in the US and Canada, seeking answers to the following questions:  &lt;p&gt;- Why do bullies bully? &lt;br&gt;- What does bullying do to victims, their families and society in general? &lt;br&gt;- Is there any way to break the vicious cycle and instead practice tolerance and appreciate diversity?  &lt;p&gt;In this book, both the bullies and the bullied offer promising solutions.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Authors&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Peter W. Schroeder is a journalist and economist. After being stationed as a diplomatic correspondent in different parts of the world, he works as a columnist for a group of European newspapers. He has published books about history, the Holocaust, human rights, and American-European relations. &lt;br&gt;Dagmar Schroeder-Hildebrand is a psychologist and also a journalist. She was founder and chief editor of a magazine for the parents of physically and mentally challenged children. Like her husband she works as a newspaper correspondent. She has published books about social issues, minority and children&#39;s rights, and biographies. &lt;br&gt;The husband-and-wife team divides their time between Washington, D.C, Victoria/Canada and Germany. They have two children and five grandchildren." />
