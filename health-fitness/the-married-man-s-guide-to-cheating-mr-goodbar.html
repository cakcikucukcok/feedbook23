      <meta name="description" content="Variety is the spice of life! Can you imagine what life would be like without varietyonly eating soup every day, watching the same television show, or wearing the same shirt or the same pair of pants every day? Doesnt that just seem ludicrous? So why would we have sex with the same woman for the rest of our lives? While author Mr. Goodbar believes that being in a committed relationship, such as marriage, can be goodeven great at timesit can also become repetitive and even boring. 
&lt;i&gt;The Married Mans Guide to Cheating&lt;/i&gt; was written to help men enjoy the spice of life without having to pay the ultimate pricelosing their married life, having to pay alimony or child support, and losing half of everything they own. Most of this guide was developed based on discussions with married men who have either been successfully cheating or those who have been caught cheating. Just about every married man with whom Mr. Goodbar spoke, when asked how long they been married, responded, Too long!
&lt;i&gt;The Married Mans Guide to Cheating&lt;/i&gt; offers insight into how to become a successful cheater and common actions to avoid when cheating." />
