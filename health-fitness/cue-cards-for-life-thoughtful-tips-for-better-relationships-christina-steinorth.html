  <title>Cue Cards for Life: Thoughtful Tips for Better Relationships - Christina Steinorth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;With almost 7 billion people on the planet, we&#39;re bound to run into communication problems sometime. And though we know healthy relationships and a sense of community are essential for a healthy, happy, and successful life, some of us are not equipped or quite prepared to deal with the situations and the life transitions we sometimes face. &lt;I&gt;Cue Cards for Life&lt;/I&gt; is a handy, intuitive &quot;how to&quot; guide that can be easily applied in real life situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In her private practice as a psychotherapist, Christina Steinorth noticed that many of her patients came in with the same communication problems. Couples would neglect their love relationships, parents would talk &lt;I&gt;at&lt;/I&gt; their teens instead of talking &lt;I&gt;to&lt;/I&gt; them, and adults found few guidelines for interacting well with their aging parents. In fact, most people seemed to put more thought into deciding what to have for dinner than they did in choosing what they said and how they behaved in important situations. As a result,  &lt;I&gt;something&lt;/I&gt; seemed to go wrong -- but they were unsure of exactly &lt;I&gt;what&lt;/I&gt;. Steinorth made Cue Cards for her patients to help them with these recurring problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cue Cards are deceptively simple reminders and remedies that anyone can use to immediately improve just about any relationship. Each card is accompanied by a clear and encouraging explanation of the psychological principles that make the cue card work. These straightforward tips are so practical and down-to-earth that anyone can use them to communicate effectively with others, minimize conflict, and handle life transitions with greater ease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book starts with an overview of communication basics, such as the importance of listening and eye contact, boundaries and personal space, and nonverbal communication (body language). Steinorth then offers prompts that highlight what to say and do in a variety of situations. The book includes Cue Cards for improving communication/relationships in the areas of love, parent/teen interaction, caring for aging parents, getting along with in-laws and in the workplace. There are also Cue Cards for weddings, parties and major  social events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book can be read cover to cover or readers can easily flip to sections relevant to their needs. The 47 &quot;Cue Cards&quot; are presented visually as cards, leaving potential for a later card deck. These prompts can also be used daily as an overall commitment to improved relationships in one&#39;s life, or to creatively foster more harmonious relationships in a group or between individuals. Each card reminds the reader about some interpersonal basic, such as taking responsibility, earning respect, being honest, asking for help, being kind, being a good role model - even grooming!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Cue Cards for Life can help people improve their daily interactions. Most of us underestimate the power common courtesy and kindness have to improve all relationships, and all of us encounter situations in life where we stumble a little. Sometimes we need a gentle reminder -- a cue card, a clue card -- to steer us back in the right direction. &lt;/div&gt;" />
