  <title>I&#39;m Ben in This Hat - Sherry Sturman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Benjamin was 3 years old, he stood in the kitchen with a big straw hat on his head ready to go to work.  Bens mom, the author asked him Are you a farmer today in that hat?   Ben replied without missing a beat, Im Ben in this Hat.  This was a defining moment as a parent, in that her child expressed for the first time and with confidence the wonderful sense of self.   This book is about Bens adventures with his beloved dog Bonnie and the positive message that, being yourself, is what matters most. The brief and repetitive nature of the text is coupled with full color illustrations brought to life by Amanda Hamlin, a friend of the author.  This book is bedtime appropriate because it is about imagination, dreams, and the importance of a confident self.  Based on a true life interaction, this book should become a favorite for preschool aged children.  Incorporating the name of your child as part of the book is welcomed and encouraged." />
