  <title>The Shared-Meal Revolution - Carol Archambeault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does your current mealtime routine consist of eating on the run, picking up fast food at the drive-through, or grabbing food cafeteria style? Do the members of your household dash away from the kitchen each night and gobble a microwave meal alone in their rooms? Are you too overwhelmed at the end of your day to make a meal with your family or loved ones happen? 
The Shared-Meal Revolution: How to Reclaim Balance and Connection in a Fragmented World through Sharing Meals with Family and Friends by popular blogger and writer Carol Archambeault offers the help we need. The book takes the reader through the steps of understanding, planning, implementing, and sustaining a shared-meal practice. It contains valuable research about the many benefits of sharing meals, helpful resources, and easy-to-use post-chapter exercises, allowing readers to develop a shared-meal plan to fit their lives. 
In this eye-opening examination of a vital, yet neglected, American ritual, Archambeault proposes that when we abandon the shared-meal experience, we starve ourselves of the connection that is as necessary to our survival as the actual food we eat.
Through Archambeaults collection of research of the many developmental benefits sharing meals affects (social, psychological, physical, cultural, spiritual, academic, and creative) and her relatable personal experiences, readers are provided with the tools they need to create their own shared-meal plan.
We are desperate to feel closeness with our children, spouses, family, and friends and would welcome a strategy that will help us address a host of distractions that deter us from gathering together for a meal. The Shared-Meal Revolution explains how we can help reverse the forces of modern culture that promote alienation and rebuild meaningful connection through sharing meals. 
The book is for everyoneparents, families, couples, and single peopleto learn how to reclaim mealtimes, leading to a more joyful and balanced life." />
