  <title>Words and Seeds - Mae Archilla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sticks and stones can break your bones and words can also harm you.  
Mae believes that words (whether good or bad), are actions ready to happen.  In speaking the written word, we bring it to life with unlimited potential.  
If you understand that life and death are in the Power of the tongue, then by all means this book will give you insight on how you can check yourself before uttering the wrong words to your children, to your spouse or to your best friends or even to your co-workers.
You will quickly learn how to speak, when to speak, what to speak, and why it is important to use words to our advantage, to favor ourselves, our children and our future.
Mae demonstrates the Power of the Spoken Word. Her straight forward and courageous style will challenge you to understand how the spoken word influences whole societies and how you can make a real difference in your world today merely by what you speak.
