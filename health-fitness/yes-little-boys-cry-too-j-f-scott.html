  <title>Yes, Little Boys Cry Too - J F Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most autobiographies are about famous people. The  difference between these people and myself is that my lifes story  is a way to explain and share how two little boys lived a life of  childhood abuse  and the scars this abuse left behind. I did not write this book to feel sorry for myself but to inform others that, Yes, little boys cry too!!!
Not enough information is documented on how many little boys and young men have been abused, which I find quite disturbing. However, every time I read a new statistic on the number of boys that have been and will be abused, the percentages keep going up and up. You must remember that in the past, we as boys, were taught never to cry and or to show emotions. Most of us hid the abuse and many still will not  reveal what happened to them.
Young girls and young ladies are by far the largest group of victims. However, I refuse to be swept under a rug about a situation past and present that leaves scars on all the victims. Yes, today, I can finally come out and say that my brother and I were both victims of verbal, psychological, the severest of physical abuse and yes, sexual  abuse. I somehow survived these abuses but sadly my brother did not. He ended up committing suicide at a young age. Three days before his death he telephoned me to admit he was afraid of turning out like our abuser --our mother!. He was  afraid he was becoming like her and did not want that life for the wonderful woman he had married and his 10 month old daughter. 
If one person reads this book and sees the signs of abuse and helps just one child, then I shall die happy knowing that this one child was spared. Also, this book has a meaning other than you feeling sorry for me, as I dont need nor want pity. Neither is this book where I want to air out my famililies faults and failures. 
To this day, I have never told a person about my young life. I chose to wait until all the people who had made my life a living hell had passed away. What inspired me to open up was an experience that happened to me about 5 years ago, I was living with my former partner in Buenos Aires, Argentina and one day he happened to pick up a folder of old pictures. In the folder were school photographs of  me from around the age of first through 6th grade. I saw that he had the pictures spread over the dining room table and had this confused look on his face. 
Finally he spoke and said, Jim I need to ask you a question, Why in all these pictures do you have marks on your face? He went on pointing out that in each picture I had either a busted lip, scratches and even a black eye. I suddenly went into a panic mode. Somebody saw what I had kept hidden over 25 years and something I wanted to forget. I sat there for at least 2 hours and told him everything that had happened to me from starting my life in an orphanage until I was almost 3 years old and up to the present.
The torture in my life did not end the day my Mother put me out of the house at 15/16 years old. My life still had more obstacles for me to face. I was then fighting my own sexuality, I didnt understand what was happening and sadly had not one person I could trust. I needed help and back in the late 60s and 70s there were no organizations available to help. An alternative life style in those days were not accepted anywhere! I was an outcast from what the world called normal and there was no alternatives. I remember boys getting the hell knocked out of them if they were even considered just a little too effeminate. I had my share of two such bullies has a kid and I didnt need that experience again.  
I realize that times have changed and through this wonderful thing called the media, my heroes in life have showed the public just the tip of the iceberg. Please dont fall in the trap of believing that since times have changed; people have. Today we have people like Oprah, Ricky Martin, and Ellen Degeneres who have brought this fact to the publics attention as w" />
