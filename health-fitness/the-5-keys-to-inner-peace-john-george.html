  <title>The 5 Keys to Inner Peace - John George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Are you tired of going on an emotional rollercoaster? Sick of having your buttons pushed by others? Keep getting confused as to what you should do with your life?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From being diagnosed with clinical depression to living an inspired life, John explains lifes natural blueprint for creation that simply flows.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Peace comes first, followed by purpose, which leads to high performance. Flow occurs, allowing you to create without struggling and straining.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Five Keys to Inner Peace&lt;/i&gt;, John outlines a simple science to being at peace that is remarkably simple, transforming the lives of those who apply the five keys.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Quite simply, human beings are not at peace when one or more of the fi ve keys are out of balance.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When you balance all five through simple action steps, you have nowhere left to fall. The uneasy feeling in your chest is replaced by a sense of peace, which allows you to make better decisions in all areas of life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book will help readers regain a sense of who they truly are and rediscover what they came into this world with: inner peace and self-love.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was fortunate to be coached by John on the five keys to inner peace. As a counselor myself, it really opened my eyes to a whole new way of living. Most importantly it improved my relationships with my husband and daughter. You will never see yourself or life the same way again. Do yourself a huge favor and read the book.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;Netia M." />
