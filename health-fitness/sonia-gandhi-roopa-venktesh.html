  <title>Sonia Gandhi - Roopa Venktesh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sonia Gandhi: The Power Part I is a book I have pleasure in presenting to the curious reader/s and the critics I hope who respect the power in what I love to believe is a phenomenal career in politics. The reason for writing this book is purely as a source of inspiration to many women like myself who struggle to live a challenging life abroad. What acceptance means to people who work abroad is perhaps something I have struggled to express as when there is no acceptance of the ideals, they fail to flourish as they should do. I sincerely hope with globalisation, people and values be widely accepted regardless of the religion, colour, creed, race, and nationality and there be no discrimination on such a basis or characteristic.
It is but sad to see many ideals and values being crushed as they do not represent a particular nation, a particular religion, a particular race, a particular language, a particular gender, and the list of characteristics seems to never be protected. Imagining there be one whole world of peace where discrimination ceases is but a dream of possibility I wished a reader could imagine after reading this book. Mrs Sonia Gandhi, I strongly feel, should be accepted, accepted for her strong determination to work against odds to work for the larger good of the society. Now if this society means a region outside of where she was born, I feel she deserves in fact greater respect, and it is but appalling to see the contrary gaining importance.
Dear reader/s and critics, I welcome you to embrace to respect the power of Mrs Gandhi in enduring the sacrifices of her dear husband, late Rajiv Gandhi, and her dear mother-in-law, late Indira Gandhiji, and perhaps the power of determination and strength to work against odds with respect and consideration.
I simply fail to understand why Mrs Gandhi has been largely misunderstood.
This book attempts to inspire a reader appreciate the power of sacrifice, patience, determination, and resilience in Mrs Gandhi. This book also revives the strong principles of Mrs Gandhis unity, tolerance, and freedom, which Mrs Gandhis congress party stands for, which were perhaps forgotten in the 2014 elections." />
