  <title>Dancing with Max - Emily Colson, Charles W. Colson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The true story of a single mother&#39;s love and perseverance, her son&#39;s autism diagnosis with its challenges and gifts, and their triumph together over life&#39;s toughest obstacles. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journey with Emily Colson--daughter of Chuck Colson--as she takes you from her darkest days of pain to her adventure through life. With candor and wit, she shares about her personal battles and heartbreak when, as a suddenly single mother, she discovered her only child has autism. Emily illuminates the page with imagery--making you laugh, making you cry, inspiring you to face your own challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we discover that Max&#39;s disability does not so much define who he is, but reveals who we are. &lt;em&gt;Dancing with Max&lt;/em&gt; is not a fairy tale with a magical ending. It&#39;s a real-life story of grace and second chances and fresh starts in spite of life&#39;s hardest problems. And Max? Max will make you fall in love with life all over again, leaving you dancing with joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story that will inspire you to &quot;get up and live,&quot; to break free of the barriers that threaten to constrict your life. And this is the young man who will capture, even change, your heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes contributions from Chuck Colson, in his most personal writing since &lt;em&gt;Born Again&lt;/em&gt;, as he details how Max&#39;s resilient spirit unraveled his thinking and brought out his tender side as a grandfather.&lt;/p&gt;" />
