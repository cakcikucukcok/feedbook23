  <title>People Skills Magic - Frank  F Loomis III</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book can change lives for the better by teaching persons how best to use crucial people skills in their dealings with fellow human beings. And it does a more thorough and complete job of this than does Dale Carnegie&amp;rsquo;s 1936 wonderful classic, &lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It does, because of its far greater scope or coverage. It doesn&amp;acute;t just anecdotally tell how to use a few key people skills. Rather it teaches hundreds of ways to use all kinds of them. For example, the book&amp;acute;s table of contents contains some 250 topics. They cover just about every situation we all encounter in interrelating with other people in our lives. This means family, friends, romantic partners, spouses, co-workers, bosses, customers, clients, just about anyone we deal with whether regularly, occasionally or just once.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is the most in-depth book ever written on people skills.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And to demonstrate how best to handle touchy, as well as routine matters that can be mishandled, the author uses all kinds of down-to-earth sketches involving colorful characters and dialogue. You&amp;acute;ll find yourself readily identifying with the situations they portray.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You&amp;acute;ll likely react by saying to yourself things like: &lt;em&gt;&amp;uml;Hey, that happened to me last week when . . . By golly, Joe did that to me at the Christmas party . . . That jerk at the mart pulls that baloney every time I call . . . Betty is one of those . . . Oh my gosh, I do that all the time. I gotta stop it.&amp;uml; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Now, underpinning all the instructive &amp;ldquo;how-tos&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how-nots&amp;rdquo; in this work, are bedrock people skills principles, premised on common sense and the author&amp;acute;s vast experiences. And emphasizing his sincerity and earnestness, at times to illustrate his points and first hand knowledge, he humbly tells about his blunders, humiliations, and frustrations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And most importantly, he explains things in a well organized, fascinatingly interesting manner. Add to that, he uses no technical &amp;ldquo;mumbo-jumbo,&amp;rdquo; the malarkey found in so many self-help books, which makes them so boring they put us to sleep.&amp;nbsp;This is why many of us seldom get half through them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In sharp contrast, this book is riveting and conversationally informal. It&amp;rsquo;s almost like the author, a sage elder, is sitting at your kitchen table, personally chatting with you over a cup of coffee and nibbling cookies.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All in all, quite pointedly and effectively this book shows and tells what fabulous results can evolve from properly using people skills in dealing with people in life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And if you train and discipline yourself to do the things this wise person says, not just now and then, but consistently, you will be absolutely astounded as to how much better your life will become.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That said, it&amp;acute;s hard to imagine anyone, who to some degree could not benefit from reading and following what this book teaches: basic principles of fairness, considerateness, and decency in interrelating with other human beings.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If only more of us would practice these things, the world would be a better place to live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
