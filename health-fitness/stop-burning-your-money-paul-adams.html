  <title>Stop Burning Your Money - Paul Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People, as a rule, will work hard within cultural common sense and just assume that all will go well. But, &quot;right now, 90 million Americans are faced with the most critical investment challenges of their lives.&quot; They are not prepared and are unsure how they will support themselves when they retire. That cultural common sense must not be working.&lt;p&gt;
Financial advisors are taught to advise the majority of people. The median household income in this country is $46,000 a year. Financial institutions are organized around acquiring the masses as clients. The clients of Clearline Financial Group are the top 10% households as defined by annual income and net worth. We are committed to building a firm that will help our clients in areas that matter to then most. Many of our clients have questions like: &lt;p&gt;
Am I making the best use of the dollars I am saving?
Will I be able to retire and be okay given I may live 25-30 years in retirement?
Am I exposed to losing a great deal of my wealth or income if I were to be sued?
When I leave this earth what kind of impact will I leave behind? &lt;p&gt;
Clearline Financial Group was created as a result of its founder realizing that many people feel as though they have been taken advantage of when meeting with a traditional financial advisor. Often these people are pushed toward a set of pre-packaged investments that aren&#39;t tailored to their desires. These potential clients can feel they have lost control of their money and aren&#39;t involved in the process. We offer a process that gives our clients the tools to succeed and supplies them with guidance on how to use those tools to achieve their dreams.&lt;p&gt;" />
