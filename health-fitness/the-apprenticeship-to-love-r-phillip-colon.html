  <title>The Apprenticeship to Love - R. Phillip Colon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reentering the dating scene after a painful divorce or the end of a long-term relationship can be difficult, if not downright daunting. Though there are numerous how-to guides on how to navigate the dating world, The Apprenticeship to Love is dramatically different. Why? It can help you find the right person at the right time. 
Based on a simple, step-by-step program specifically tailored to the love-challenged, this groundbreaking work will teach you how to look for and find a healthy, fulfilling, viable life partner, while having fun and making new friends in the process. Utilizing the principles of focused effort, incremental success, and social networking, youll learn how to meet and date three members of the opposite sex who will become potential candidates in your search for a mate. 
Dr. R. Phillip Colon makes the program easy to learn. Once you develop a better understanding of what qualities characterize your life partner, you will replace your first candidates with new ones several times until you find the person meant for you. By learning and applying new social, emotional, and interpersonal skills, youll soon access higher-level, more suitable contenders and at the same time, ready yourself for better relationships through personal growth.
Love doesnt have to be complicated or agonizing. Find your happily ever after with The Apprenticeship to Love!" />
