  <title>Manosophy - Stephen Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Men go through life without a plan or a guiding philosophy. The result is, men often give up their dreams too soon or abandon them entirely. No more. This book allows a man to create his own game plan based upon a personal operating philosophy (POP) that comes from a philosophy designed for men. Its a manosophy that offers guidance and charts a path for a man who wants to be transformed into a man of purpose, yet it also requires that a man seek and have happiness as a foundation of any worldview. Men are often denied the right to be happy; they defer it or avoid it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This manosophy establishes what you believe and want in life and how to achieve it so this life is the one you own and desire. It provides diagnostic tools for you to use to review your goals. It offers man-to-man honesty on topics as gnarly as sex, loss, and manipulation by others. You will emerge after reading this with exercises to keep you on track, and you will not ever be alone in your quest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book for men long overdue and celebrates men with respect and offers a modern view of the culture that negates a man finding his own way with power. There is no game you can win without a plan. And the plan may not succeed, but if you have no plan, no manosophy, you will be assuredly following the plan of someone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is your life. Now make it follow your plan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
