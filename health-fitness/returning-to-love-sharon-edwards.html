  <title>Returning to Love - Sharon Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hurry, honey, I see the light. I have to go. Come kiss me bye. Bye, baby, I love you. These are the last words my husband said to me when he transitioned. It had been a long and tortuous path to enlightenment. He got to see into heaven three weeks before he transitioned. He could not believe the love. We both learned life lessons and grew spiritually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had been a long journey for Richard and me, but we both learned lessons of strength, love, forgiveness, and, most importantly, the enlightenment needed to release the fear of death. This is a journal of our love and living with Richards Alzheimers and Parkinsons, prostate cancer, and congestive heart failure. I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, and I am relating the coping mechanisms I used to deal with Richards transition and the transition of my mom nine months before Richard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The journey taken by those who are caregivers is a lonely one at times. Coming to an acceptance is as hard for the caregiver and family and friends as it is for the one you loveaccepting the fact that no matter how positive your thoughts, the healing for your loved one may be a healing of his or her soul and not of the body. Then you and your loved one can walk his or her path together. Your support can make your loved ones transition peaceful and loving. As you help loved ones to lose their fear of dying, you will learn of the beauty and love awaiting them in heaven. This will aid in your healing when your loved ones transition to heaven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be sadness, and tears will flow because they are gone and not physically with you anymore. You can find strength and peace in knowing that the care you gave allowed your loved ones to die with dignity surrounded by love and support and without fear.&lt;/p&gt;" />
