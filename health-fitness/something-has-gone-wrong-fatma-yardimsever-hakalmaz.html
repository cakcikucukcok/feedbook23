  <title>Something Has Gone Wrong - Fatma Yardimsever Hakalmaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Something has gone wrong 
Reflections from The heart
The world we are living in is changing, but unfortunately it is not a happy change.  
I am a Turkish Muslim women, living in Europe. In this work you will find reflections and expressions from my heart, about every day subjects that made me think, cry and laugh. 
I believe that life is all about a constant War against our bad inner desires, the Jihad against the Nafs. 
As long as we do not sit down for a moment and ask ourselves where, how and why has it gone wrong, then the hate, fighting, wars will never end. To change the world, we have to start first with changing the I.  Nobody can change the I, except the I itself.
 Long live the snake as long as it does not bite me 
Beni sokmayan yilan bin yasasin is an expression, that I want to use for people, who are indifferent  about pains and sufferings of others, as long as it does not concern them.  
Acting like the three monkeys against injustice, will not bring any benefit to any of us, because  a snake is a snake,  It will poison without particularizing.
