  <title>The Cancer Solution - Jack C. Westman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book should be read as a requirement for anyone diagnosed with cancer.  It will serve as a tremendous practical guide for cancer patients and their families.
Thomas N. Seyfried, 
Professor of biology at Boston College and author of Cancer as a Metabolic Disease: On the Origin, Management, and Prevention of Cancer.
This book is a must read for every adult as cancer remains our greatest enemy. If you have experience with cancer, via a family member or friend, once you start reading this book, it will be hard to put down.
Peter L. Pedersen, 
Professor of Biological Chemistry &amp; Oncology, Johns Hopkins University.
Dr. Westmans personal experience with cancer led him to extensively research the state of cancer care. Strengthening the bodys own immune system to prevent and control cancer has shown very promising results, but it is largely ignored by mainstream cancer research and treatment. If you care about winning the war on cancer, this book will motivate you to advocate for more funding for this line of research.
Stephen L. Swanson, 
Past Chair of the Board of Directors of the American Cancer Society
Dr. Westmans book is amazing, creative, innovative, different, stimulating and outstanding.
Bharat B. Aggarwal, Professor of Cancer Research, 
University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center." />
