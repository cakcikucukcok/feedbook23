  <title>Shattered … but Not Broken - Judy Treadwell Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Judy Treadwell Gray offers her readers the story of Mattie, a thirty-year-old woman who is attempting to create a better life for herself and her fi ve children after living in a home where violence and alcohol abuse are rampant. Mattie knows what a good life looks like, having grown up loved and cared for. She makes the brave decision to leave her children with her mother while she undergoes a week of intense group therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One by one, Mattie confronts her demons, the hurts and losses that have haunted her, especially the loss of her beloved sister, Cheryl, to leukemia. She relives her relationship with her abusive husband and their divorce, her second marriage, and her guilt over an affair. Throughout her life, her love and concern for her children and grandchildren remain a constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Mattie realizes it is her faith in God that sustains her and carries her safely through life. The poetry that concludes her book is written from the depths of the authors heart as an offering to her readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
