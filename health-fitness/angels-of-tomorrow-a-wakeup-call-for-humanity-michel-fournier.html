      <meta name="description" content="Michel Fournier is a visionary, mostly known for renowned realizations. Actively involved in the business, he witnessed how the digital age has and continues to change the way humans behave towards technology and how destructive this is, which among many things affects our personal relationships. His vision and perception of the butterfly effect this has provided in a matter of just a few years is something he considers very sad and highly destructive. This book sees the light of day to share some thoughts about the restoration a balance. Highly based on personal experiences, the book rapidly turned into a wakeup call to give the next generation something to rely on. From relationships, to dating, to quotes of life, this book contains a lot of materials so to take one step back to realize what we have done wrong with the ability to foresee a world where every human being deserves to have an Angel somewhere and once we would have reached the end of the road, we could then say we&#39;ve done good!" />
