  <title>Psychoconduction - Chester Litvin PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He calls his process psychoconduction and likens it to the medical use of stem cells. In psychoconduction, simple cells are harnessed to process information normally handled by complex cells.
        The US Review of Books
This book is about a series of exercises to reeducate the brain cells. This explains the method and system for the psychological treatment by brain stimulation of the psychologically disordered object. This provides a possibility to stimulate the simple cells to assist the complex cells in order to correctly perform the assigned command. The system reeducates the brain cells by transferring the same information to various parts of the brain. Psychoconduction is the process of translating the simplified symbol to various parts of the brain. The goal is to correct or replace the complex cells, which can be audio, video, kinesthetic, and/or olfactory. Those cells have difficulty in processing information correctly and need to be tuned up and balanced. The tune-up of the different parts of the brain on the same information is providing correction to the complex brain cell. This method provides many patterns of video, audio, kinesthetic symbols. The patterns of visual, audio, kinesthetic, olfactory, tactile, and musical information can be based on the binary arithmetic and can be different from binary base. Those various patterns are called Litvins Code. In this book, the patterns are based on binary code.
