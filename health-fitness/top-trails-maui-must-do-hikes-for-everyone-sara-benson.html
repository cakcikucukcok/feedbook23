  <title>Top Trails: Maui: Must-Do Hikes for Everyone - Sara Benson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Maui is indeed a hiker&#39;s paradise. An impressive network of trails crisscross the second-largest Hawaiian island, from meditative beach walks to heady treks high atop a volcano. Hidden in cloud forest, more trails lead to tumbling waterfalls, hidden springs and groves of bamboo. Back down on the coast, treks lead to natural lava-rock blowholes and sea arches, past ocean pools, and deserted beaches. Wander across lava flows that feel primeval, examine ancient Hawaiian petroglyphs up close, or follow the King&amp;#8217;s Highway that Hawaiian royalty once trod. All this and more awaits on Maui&amp;#8217;s hiking trails, most of which are easily accessible day trips. From any point on the island, any of the dozens of trailheads pinpointed in this book is at most a couple of hours&amp;#8217; drive away, and often far closer than that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Top Trails Maui&lt;/I&gt; presents 37 premier day hiking and overnight camping and backpacking trips suited to all levels of ability and interests. The book is divided into four major geographical areas: West Maui, Central/South Maui, East Maui/Upcountry, and Haleakala National Park. All of the trails offer scenic beauty and ease of access for hikers. Together, these trails represent the island&amp;#8217;s incredible diversity of ecological systems and environments, from lava flows and multi-colored cinder cones to cloud forests filled with native bird song and hidden waterfalls. Some of the hiking trails described here are popular with both locals and visitors, while others are virtually a local secret.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With the Top Trails winning formula of easy-to-follow maps for every hike, trail-feature charts, feature icons, &quot;don&#39;t get lost&quot; trail milestones, and GPS waypoints, readers can easily identify the right trail for their interests, abilities, and available time.&lt;/div&gt;" />
