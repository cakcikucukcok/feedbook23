  <title>Tales of a Bulimic Babe: Simple wisdom to live the life you crave - Iris Ruth Pastor, Paula Stahel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Tales of a Bulimic Babe&amp;quot; is about a woman who apparently &amp;#39;has it all&amp;#39;&amp;mdash;a happy marriage, five well-adjusted sons, a stimulating career, lots of friends and extended family. But what Iris Ruth Pastor keeps hidden from them all was her addiction to a lover she called&amp;nbsp;ED&amp;mdash;her eating disorder. This is the story of her shedding that secret, facing and owning her addiction, and taking courageous steps to break free of the disorder that ruled her entire life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did she tame the triggers that led to bingeing and purging? Deal with the ravenous monster within? And navigate the road back to a healthier, happier, and more fully engaged life? If you&amp;#39;ve ever grappled with something that prevents you from operating at full throttle, Iris&amp;#39;s brutally honest yet witty and inspirational story answers the tough questions, while reminding us that the possibility of recovery is within our reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In this honest, insightful and inspiring book, Iris Ruth Pastor shares her story of recovery from a decades-long battle with bulimia. She brings a poignant and relatable honesty to this memoir, using both wisdom and humor to bring readers on the journey from despair to healing. This is a must-read for anyone who struggles with an eating disorder, or knows someone who does; by sharing her experience, Iris offers insight, understanding and hope.&amp;quot; &amp;mdash;Dr. Nina Savelle-Rocklin, PsyD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iris Ruth Pastor is 5&amp;rsquo;2&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;the truth. She weighs 115 lbs.&amp;mdash;a lie. She&amp;rsquo;s a baby boomer, author, speaker and storyteller. For the past twenty-eight years, she&amp;rsquo;s written a slice-of-life column entitled &amp;ldquo;Incidentally, Iris.&amp;rdquo; In between the unremitting rigors of raising five sons, she hosted a radio program, co-wrote a book with her mother&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;Slices, Bites and Other Facts of Life&amp;quot;&amp;mdash;and became the editor of the &amp;quot;American Israelite.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iris entered the social media age kicking and bitching and screaming in order to foster connection and offer tidbits of authenticity to uplift and inspire herself as well as others. Which she did as a Huffington Post &amp;ldquo;Must-Read Blogger of 2015.&amp;rdquo; She is terrifyingly dipping into the vlogging arena (a combination of video and blogging), publishes a weekly newsletter through her website and travels the country talking to live audiences about the importance of &amp;ldquo;Preserving Your Bloom,&amp;rdquo; using your talents and resources to be the best you can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While doing so, she tries not to be judgmental, cloying, hypocritical, whiney, snippy, overly sensitive, and overwhelmed. Sometimes she even manages to carry it off.&lt;/p&gt;" />
