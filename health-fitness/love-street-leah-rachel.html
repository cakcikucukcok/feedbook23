  <title>Love Street - Leah Rachel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Visually arresting, irresistibly sexy, and ferociously funny, this faux 1980s pulp love magazine is the perfect beach read, coffee table accessory, or gift from the brain that brought you @theyellowhairedgirl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dedicated to broken-hearted girls who will always love again . . .&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever hooked up with a homeless hottie who stole your heart, but then also your potato chips? Flaked out on friends and changed the course of your entire life after meeting the &amp;#8220;perfect&amp;#8221; guy before discovering his multiple undiagnosed anti-social personality disorders? Planned a What-Would-Dolly-Parton-Do day but then realized you have no hair spray and just ate raw cookie dough by yourself instead? If it&amp;#8217;s happened to Leah Rachel, it can happen to you. Instagram&amp;#8217;s insanely popular Yellow Haired Girl, &amp;#160;unloads in this brutally funny and vibrantly illustrated book about love, fluids, resilience, pain, and owning the whole marvelous mess we call womanhood. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with quizzes, recipes for the lost, mad libs, puzzles, horoscopes, and raw personal essays, &lt;em&gt;Love Street &lt;/em&gt;is packed with screw-it-all advice on sex, drugs, diets, dating, self-esteem, body image, friends, romance, masturbation, fashion, and crashing into love so fast and hard you&amp;#8217;re as sure as your lost dignity it&amp;#8217;s the real thing. This unique, eye-popping work of pulp art is both aspirational and cringingly relatable. This is for any woman who isn&amp;#8217;t afraid to wear her heart on her sleeve, no matter how many times it&amp;#8217;s been through the washer. Paper dolls included.&lt;/p&gt;" />
