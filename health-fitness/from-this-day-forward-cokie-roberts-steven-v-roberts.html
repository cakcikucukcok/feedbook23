  <title>From This Day Forward - Cokie Roberts, Steven V. Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After thirty years together, Cokie and Steve Roberts know something about marriage and after thirty distinguished years in journalism, they know how to write about it.In &lt;em&gt;From This Day Forward,&lt;/em&gt; Cokie and Steve weave their personal stories of matrimony into a wider reflection on the state of marriage in American today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here they write with the same conversational style that catapulted Cokie&#39;s &lt;em&gt;We Are Our Mother&#39;s Daughters&lt;/em&gt; to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller list.  They ruminate on their early worries about their different faiths -- she&#39;s Catholic, he&#39;s Jewish -- and describe their wedding day at Cokie&#39;s childhood home.  They discuss the struggle to balance careers and parenthood, and how they compromise when they disagree.  They also tell the stories of other American marriages: that of John and Abigail Adams, and those pioneers, slaves and immigrants.  They offer stories of broken marriages as well, of contemporary families living through the &quot;divorce revolution&quot;.  Taken together, these tales reveal the special nature of the wedding bond in America.  Wise and funny, this book is more than an endearing chronicle of a loving marriage -- it is a story of all husbands and wives, and how they support and strengthen each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
