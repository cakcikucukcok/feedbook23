  <title>Justice Jesters Jesus - A.J. Rozalyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Justice Jesters Jesus: Stuck in Yesterday with the God of Yesterday Today and Tomorrow presents a true story of a family undergoing an arduous encounter with the justice system. The author, writing under the nom de plum A.J. Rozalyn, tells the story of Doug Kain and Mindy Morris, a Catholic man and a Methodist woman, who meet, fall in love, conceive a child, reject advice to seek abortion or adoption, and make plans to marry in the Methodist Church. As their lives head down a road that grows bumpier the further they travel, they reach the point, because of concerns about child abuse, where the justice system intervenes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it narrates this journey, Justice Jesters Jesus offers Scriptures that share consolation and comfort, aiding any who would identify with the familys travails. This encourages trust in God, whose protection extends to all in need, no matter how horrific their circumstances may become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Jesters Jesus: Stuck in Yesterday with the God of Yesterday Today and Tomorrow does not share a story easily told or read. Even so, when one spends time with Doug and Mindy and the others in their lives, one can find strength in trusting that Godwho is the same yesterday today and tomorrowis the God of whom a prophet wrote, For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, says the LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope (Jeremiah 29:11 NKJV).&lt;/p&gt;" />
