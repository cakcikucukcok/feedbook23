  <title>&quot;Devotional of Communion Messages&quot; - Bruce Allyn Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ezekiel 31:7
Thus it was beautiful  in greatness
And  in the length of it branches,
Because its roots reached to abundant waters.
Romans  11:13
For if the first fruit is holy, the lump
Is also holy; and if the root is holy, so
Are the branches.
Ephesians 3:17
that Christ my dwell in your hearts through 
Faith; that you, being
Rooted and grounded in love.
By the Grace of God  I have recently,  with the passing of my father,  been able to realize and understand my  roots through the tribe of Aaron.  As a result of this blessing  I have been  inspired by my church and family to  write this devotional of Communion Messages.  Hopefully, this devotional will be a  blessing  to anyone that can use it for  Communion in Church, or at home. With this blessing I sign my name;                                                                                          Bruce Allyn Cohen" />
