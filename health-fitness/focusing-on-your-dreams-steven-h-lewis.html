  <title>Focusing on Your Dreams - Steven H. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Focus begins with a good attitude. You have the ability to transform your
life and soar like an eagle to new heights of success and fulfi llment.
Whether your attitude is positive or negative or somewhere in between,
the tools that are given to you in this book will allow you to move forward,
no matter where you are in life or what position you are in presently. Always
remember, there is light at the end of tunnel.
This book will show you how to take control of your life, and unleash
your incredible potential.
Its fi lled with inspiring stories and easy-to-understand success principles.
Steven H. Lewis presents this book with sincerity, clarity, and impact in a way
that will inspire you to develop your skills to their full potential and bring
out the greatness thats within you. Youll begin to see new possibilities. Youll
take action to develop your unique talents, and you will achieve extraordinary
results. Eighty-fi ve percent of anything that you do begins with a good
attitude; it doesnt matter what it is.
Initially, this book was going to be centered on what it takes to become
a professional athlete. After discussing this topic with my literary agent in
a fi ve-hour phone conversation, playing battle of the wits, he won and gave
me a new and better idea for writing this book.
First of all, I want to thank Mark Pavlovich for giving me the vision to
be able to reach everyone in the world. It doesnt matter what your goals are,
this book pertains to everyone. I feel sure that you will fi nd what is written
here extremely powerful and intriguing.
This book will give you an insight into and the motivation for selfdevelopment
through personal improvement. Through the guidelines that are
presented here, you will obtain your personal goals. This book will give the
information essential to reach your ultimate goals. This book is not pertaining
to becoming a professional athlete; the tools that you are given throughout
18 FOCUSING ON YOUR DREAMS
the contents of this book will apply in anything you do in life. This book is
about self-improvement and it will give you simple, clear guidelines on how
to obtain your goals. This book includes three different personalities and three
directions in life; the fi nal outcome will be the same. With determination,
dedication, desire, and passion we got to where we are now. We lived through
traumas and devastations. I have integrated into this book the importance
of knowing where you have been in your life. Life appeals to everyone, and
it matters how you handle ithow you start and how you fi nish. It doesnt
matter what your goals in life are. You have a starting point and a fi nish line.
In order to complete each task, it is imperative to stay focused on your goal.
Please dont misinterpret this book as just being about professional athletes;
we only are sharing our own personal experiences. I hated my past; however,
I couldnt allow my past to affect my future. It enhances what I am doing
today because I am now able to refl ect on the many setbacks that Id had to
go through in my life.
My past only gave me the opportunity to move on to the next level.
Progress is not based on how people view you. Rather, it is based on how
you see yourself as an example. When you are in the last place and your
expectations are not very high, you cant lose focus. But when you fi nish
the season and you go to the fi nals and you do your best and have high
expectations but lose anyway, then at least you know in your heart you did
your best. This is what you call fulfi lling success. So again it doesnt matter
where you end up, what counts is that you gave it your all. Sometimes you
have to give up things in order to pursue where you want be. You have to be
creative when setting goals for yourself and see beyond your fi nger next to
your nose; however, your fi nger is your vision, your creativity goes beyond
what is in front of you. By being creative, y" />
