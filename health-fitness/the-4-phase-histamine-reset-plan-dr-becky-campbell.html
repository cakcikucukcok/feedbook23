What makes her approach different--and more effective for lifelong results--is that it looks for root causes and offers a well-rounded, holistic treatment plan that addresses diet, environmental toxins, lifestyle and more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To help you uncover why your body is not processing histamine correctly, Dr. Campbell explains the eight most common factors and how to address them. Then she gives you a plan that includes a low-histamine diet, liver care, gut support and direction on how to safely reintroduce the foods that were once making you sick. Along with her wealth of delicious recipes, she also includes information on supplements, ways to reduce stress and much more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Invest in your health and use &lt;i&gt;The 4-Phase Histamine Reset Plan &lt;/i&gt;to heal your body for good.&lt;/p&gt;" />
