  <title>The Coffee Bean - Jon Gordon, Damon West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From bestselling author Jon Gordon and rising star Damon West comes &lt;i&gt;The Coffee Bean&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;an illustrated fable that teaches readers how to transform their environment, overcome challenges, and create positive change.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Life is often difficult. It can be harsh, stressful, and feel like a pot of boiling hot water. The environments we find ourselves in can change, weaken, or harden us, and test who we truly are. We can be like the carrot that weakens in the pot or like the egg that hardens. Or, we can be like the coffee bean and discover the power inside us to transform our environment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Coffee Bean &lt;/i&gt;is an inspiring tale that follows Abe, a young man filled with stress and fear as he faces challenges and pressure at school and home. One day after class, his teacher shares with him the life-changing lesson of the coffee bean, and this powerful message changes the way he thinks, acts, and sees the world. Abe discovers that instead of letting his environment change him for the worse, he can transform any environment he is in for the better. Equipped with this transformational truth, Abe embarks on an inspirational journey to live his life like the coffee bean. Wherever his life takes him, from school, to the military, to the business world, Abe demonstrates how this simple lesson can unleash the unstoppable power within you. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A delightful, quick read, &lt;i&gt;The Coffee Bean&lt;/i&gt; is purposely written and designed for readers of all ages so that everyone can benefit from this transformational lesson. This is a book and message that, when read and shared, has the power to change your life and the world around you. You just have to decide: are you a carrot, egg, or coffee bean? &lt;/p&gt;" />
