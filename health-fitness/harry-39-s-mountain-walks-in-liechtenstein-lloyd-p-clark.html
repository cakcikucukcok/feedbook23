  <title>Harry&#39;s Mountain Walks in Liechtenstein - Lloyd P. Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This guide is written in English and German to give an introduction to the mountains of Liechtenstein; a tiny and unique principality that should be on every serious walkers list of places to experience.  Venturing beyond Liechtenstein&#39;s surreal capital, Vaduz and straying off the beaten track it is hard to imagine a nicer and more scenic place anywhere in the Alps.  Enough routes are provided to fill a two week holiday thereby allowing the walker to explore every corner of the principality.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The book provides route guides and hand drawn maps for use by walkers of all levels of experience enabling them to gain an insight into the varied and challenging mountains of the worlds&#39; fourth smallest country.  Ten routes are provided along with suggestions for joining them together to give longer tours or to shorten them if time or energy are limited.  All routes are also suitable for fit and well controlled dogs.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Liechtenstein is a tiny principality bordered by Switzerland and Austria.  Most tourists visit the toy-town like capital Vaduz and continue out of the country.  The author hopes that this book will inspire readers to venture into the principality and to discover the impressive mountain scenery, the friendly locals and the fabulous refreshments available from the Alps.  More than that, readers will discover unspoilt valleys, lonely mountain paths and exquisite alpine flowers accompanied only by the sound of the wind, tumbling streams and the squealing of the marmots.
