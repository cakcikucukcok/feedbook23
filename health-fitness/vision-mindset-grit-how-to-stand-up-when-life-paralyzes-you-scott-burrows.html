  <title>Vision Mindset Grit: How To Stand Up When Life Paralyzes You - Scott Burrows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scott Burrows&amp;#39; riveting story of overcoming adversity through sheer determination, will power and goal setting is infectious. Scott played college football at Florida State University under coach Bobby Bowden and was a top ranked kickboxing champion, having his last fight broadcast by ESPN. His future was filled with promise until November 3, 1984 when, at the age of 19, he was critically injured in a disastrous automobile accident and everything changed in the blink of an eye. Scott survived, but was paralyzed and diagnosed a quadriplegic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite this grim prognosis, he refused to be sidelined. He endured years of grueling physical therapy, learned to walk again with the aid of a cane, graduated from college, had a successful career in the insurance and financial industry&amp;mdash;even qualifying for Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT), a 100% commission-driven award that fewer than 8% of agents worldwide achieve yearly. Later, Scott became a world-class motivational speaker.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vision, Mindset and Grit&amp;mdash;three powerful words that describe Scott Burrows&amp;mdash;will also inspire you to achieve your absolute best. This book is more than the story of Scott&amp;#39;s determination to overcome enormous obstacles and rebuild his life. It is a testament to his intention to inspire others and help them triumph over adversity as well. He has shared his message of hope and success with audiences throughout the world and motivated them to make positive changes in their own lives." />
