  <title>The Explosive Child - Ross W. Greene, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A groundbreaking approach to understanding and parenting children who frequently exhibit severe fits of temper and other intractable behaviors, from a distinguished clinician and pioneer in this field.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s an explosive child? A child who responds to routine problems with extreme frustration&amp;#8212;crying, screaming, swearing, kicking, hitting, biting, spitting, destroying property, and worse. A child whose frequent, severe outbursts leave his or her parents feeling frustrated, scared, worried, and desperate for help. Most of these parents have tried everything-reasoning, explaining, punishing, sticker charts, therapy, medication&amp;#8212;but to no avail. They can&amp;#8217;t figure out why their child acts the way he or she does; they wonder why the strategies that work for other kids don&amp;#8217;t work for theirs; and they don&amp;#8217;t know what to do instead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Ross Greene, a distinguished clinician and pioneer in the treatment of kids with social, emotional, and behavioral challenges, has worked with thousands of explosive children, and he has good news: these kids aren&amp;#8217;t attention-seeking, manipulative, or unmotivated, and their parents aren&amp;#8217;t passive, permissive pushovers. Rather, explosive kids are lacking some crucial skills in the domains of flexibility/adaptability, frustration tolerance, and problem solving, and they require a different approach to parenting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this compassionate, insightful, and practical book, Dr. Greene provides a new conceptual framework for understanding their difficulties, based on research in the neurosciences. He explains why traditional parenting and treatment often don&amp;#8217;t work with these children, and he describes what to do instead. Instead of relying on rewarding and punishing, Dr. Greene&amp;#8217;s Collaborative Problem Solving model promotes working with explosive children to solve the problems that precipitate explosive episodes, and teaching these kids the skills they lack.&lt;/p&gt;" />
