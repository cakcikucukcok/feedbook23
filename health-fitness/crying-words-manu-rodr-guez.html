  <title>Crying Words - Manu Rodríguez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Writing just for the sake of writing is worthless.
You have to write when you are driven to bleed into the paper.
Cry? Yes, I would like to. But I dont know how.
I only know how to cry writing. Crying words in silence. 
Crying Words is an introspective monologue, a narrative that has something to say to everyone, and yet is intensely personal. A journey, an awakening, it is Manu Rodriguez&#39; most intimate work to date.
Each of us feels alienated at some point in our lives, and everyone knows what it is to cry, but if we were able to turn those tears into words, crying with ink onto the page, would our words find a kinship with the words, and tears, of another? A way to connect emotionally, through words?
Deep down what are we really searching for? Wisdom? Money? Sex? Love? Inner peace? Perhaps these crying words will wash away the confusion of yesterday and carry us, sailing, into the future. 
Crying Words by Manu Rodriguez may answer some or all of these questions, it is certainly a frank and open account, an inner memoir, a journey; a journey which each of us must ultimately take, in some way, at some time... 
This book was published for the first time in Spain in 2005 and was translated into an English version by the author. Also included are four drawings by Chencho Aguilera, an artist from Ayamonte, Andalucia.
Manu Rodriguez was born in Sevilla, Andaluca, in 1967 to a modest and traditional family. He is a Spanish author who also writes in English. In Spanish he has published Leyendas Adolescentes (primeros cuentos de finales de siglo) (Castillejo, 1998), Llorando palabras (Celya, 2005), Manual de Escritura Curativa (Almuzara, 2010) y La ta que quiero pasa de m Y t rindote (Dauro, 2013)." />
