  <title>Tsuku Kihon - Luis Bernardo Mercado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tsuku Kihon refers to powerful and dynamic techniques used and taught by some Shotokan karate instructors. The idea behind Tsuku Kihon is that power and closing distance are greatly enhanced by propelling the body forward using basic karate principles. A group of approximately 25 Tsuku Kihon combinations was developed by several Shotokan instructors in the middle of the 20th century. Sensei Luis Bernardo Mercado decided to expand and categorize Tsuku Kihon in order to increase its applications and to create a formal structure for teaching them. Many months of trial and error by the author of this book resulted in an additional 42 combinations and three methods by which Tsuku Kihon can be systematically taught to intermediate and advanced karate students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This second edition of Tsuku Kihon is expanded to include several more exercises that will help practitioners improve their skills in this art form. Chapter 3 is for instructors to use as an introduction of Tsuku Kihon to beginners below brown belt. These exercises teach how to drop into an attack and end up in a complete front stance. Chapters 10 and 11 are meant for advanced students who have been training in Tsuku Kihon for about one year. Using the heavy bag and makiwara will sharpen skill at all levels and improve kime and distancing. Chapter 14 integrates sweeps into Tsuku Kihon combinations, which will raise kumite to a higher level of proficiency. Together, these additional drills will make for a more rounded martial arts practitioner, competitor, and improve self-defense capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another great addition to this updated book is beautiful artwork by Nobu Kaji (tsuku kihon, kihon, and kata techniques), Egil Thompson (samurai scene drawings) and Mike Thompson (wood inlay artwork for back cover). All these original works of art give a sense of real action and martial arts spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
