  <title>City Mouse - Stacey Lender</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;City Mouse&lt;/I&gt; is a sharp and sophisticated novel of suburban life with a narrative voice that is equal parts witty, observant, and vulnerable. A wonderful debut!&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;B&gt;Susan Isaacs&lt;/B&gt;, &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; best-selling author&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;For every city mom who fears death by suburbia--and for every suburban mom who wonders if it&amp;#8217;s just her--this insightful, funny trip into the secrets behind those picket fences is required reading.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;B&gt;Maureen Sherry&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;Opening Belle&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;&lt;I&gt;City Mouse&lt;/I&gt; reminds mothers of that priceless lesson: the grass is always greener...and maybe even alcohol-soaked Astroturf. I tore through this book like a bored, competitive housewife tears through her Xanax.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;B&gt;Faith Salie&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;Approval Junkie&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Priced out of their Manhattan neighborhood, Jessica and Aaron move with their young daughters to the one place Jessica swore she&amp;#8217;d never go: the suburbs. But to Jessica&amp;#8217;s surprise, life in the commuter belt makes a great first impression. She quickly falls in with a clique of helpful mom friends who welcome her with pitchers of margaritas, neighborhood secrets, and a pair of hot jeans that actually fit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Still, it&#39;s hard to keep up in a crowd where everyone competes for the most perfectly manicured home and latest backyard gadgets. And what&amp;#8217;s worse, as the only working mom in her circle, Jessica sometimes feels disconnected and alone. So she&amp;#8217;s thrilled when she&amp;#8217;s invited to a moms-only weekend at the beach, which she assumes will mean new opportunities for real talk and bonding. Instead, the trip turns into a series of eye-opening lessons, and Jessica must decide if she&amp;#8217;s strong enough to be honest with herself about the sort of life she really wants.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;City Mouse&lt;/I&gt; is an irresistible debut that examines what it means to find your place, revealing unspoken truths about motherhood, friendship, and the thorny pursuit to have it all.&lt;/div&gt;" />
