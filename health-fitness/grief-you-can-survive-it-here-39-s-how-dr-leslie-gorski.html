Here&#39;s How&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Do you wake up in the morning feeling that showering and dressing require more energy than you have? Are you wondering what happened to your old self and when, or if, it might be returning?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Does life feel overwhelming and, at times, convince you that you&#39;re going crazy?  Is time passing and the horrible imprints that you&#39;ve tried so hard not to recall, still linger, despite promises from others that time would heal your heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Are you keeping yourself busy, doing anything so that thoughts about it, won&#39;t fill you with anger or helplessness or, &quot;Oh no, not guilt!?&quot; Now, for probably the first time in your life, are efforts to find your way through this unfamiliar territory that is your grief, leaving you more confused and lost than when you initially embarked on this journey?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Then this book is the rudder, the guide that you have been searching for.  You can survive the terrible event that has stolen your life. This book gives you the emotional map needed to steer you through and beyond the troubling, unchartered territory that is your loss and grief.&lt;/p&gt;" />
