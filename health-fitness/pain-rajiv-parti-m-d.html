  <title>Pain - Rajiv Parti, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It takes someone like Dr. Rajiv Parti, an anesthesiologist who specialised in treating pain, to tell the truth about it. After suffering from a series of debilitating nearly fatal illnesses that started in August 2008, Dr. Parti realised he was addicted to painkillers in March 2011. That&#39;s when he made the difficult but ethical choice to give up his practice, to conquer his addiction, and to search for a real solution. Soon he realised that his pain was not just physical but deeply emotional, psychological, and spiritual. That led him to Ayurveda, the traditional medicine of India where he was born. By becoming a student of that ancient holistic, natural practice, which he combined with meditation and yoga, Dr. Parti was able to regain control of his life with a new focus: to share his personal journey through pain to forgiveness, love, and healing." />
