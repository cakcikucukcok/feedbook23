  <title>How the Devil Tried to Steal My Joy Through Sexual Molestation - D. Marcella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;I feel that my book is very different from other books because it is
the true story of my life experience. This story is about myself and my
mother and my ex-husbands and I feel that it need to be told because
other people could be going through the same things. I know people say
that they have heard of a book like this before, but no other book is
like this one. My life story is so different from that of others; when
you read it you will definitely know. Everyone has a different life
experience and outlook on life. As I said earlier, this is a true and
God-fearing story that I experienced. With the help of God and his Son
Jesus Christ I am able to relate to others through this book. I feel
that this book will help many people understand certain things about God
and about their own lives that they could not discover through reading
other books." />
