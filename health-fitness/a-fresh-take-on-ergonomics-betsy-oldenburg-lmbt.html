  <title>A Fresh Take on Ergonomics - Betsy Oldenburg Lmbt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As someone who has suffered for decades with an old whip lash injury, I finally have the tools needed to control the pain and repair the damage. Some of these tools are basic, but were never mentioned by the many doctors I have seen over the years. Betsy Oldenburg, a nationally certified therapeutic massage/bodywork therapist with over 30 years of experience shared those tools and techniques with me when I was referred to Integrative Therapies. Because I had such a positive experience, I arranged a Lunch and Learn (Feel and Look Great Despite your Computer) for my co-workers. We had approximately 30 in attendance ranging in age from 20s to 60s. Everyone in the room benefited from Betsys expertise and warm, approachable style. Several volunteers were lucky enough to experience hands-on treatment/techniques. I would recommend Betsys presentation to any organization that has employees who suffer from neck and back pain. It is amazing how one hour with the right person can both educate and motivate employees toward a healthier work style.&lt;/br&gt;
Jane Milanese&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Betsy Oldenburg&lt;/b&gt;s keen eye and straightforward approach to working with imbalances in my body have been a great help. By
incorporating her suggestions for posture corrections and specific stretches, in addition to receiving her bodywork, I have felt more aligned physically and mentally. Theres something about standing straight that clears ones mind. Betsy has helped me move in that direction.&lt;/br&gt;
