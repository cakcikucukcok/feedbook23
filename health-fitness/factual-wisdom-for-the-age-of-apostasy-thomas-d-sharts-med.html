  <title>Factual  Wisdom   for the Age of Apostasy - Thomas D. Sharts, Med</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book Factual Wisdom For the Age of Apostasy accounts for those issues of life synonymous with the five areas of being human (spiritual, physical, social, psychological and vocational) associated with living in an age void of truth and commonsense. Moreover, the book offers an analysis of these life issues from various expressive perspectives such as ruminations, aphorisms, sayings and proverbs.
It is the hope of this author that readers will comprehend how sacred life is in reference to safeguarding against willful ignorance, vanity, willful stupidity, cowardice and hatred while alternatively exploring and developing beliefs and behavioral lifestyles that promote the sanctity of life.
In truth, life is to be lived in such a manner that living is lifted up in glory so that each person on earth has an opportunity to achieve his/her life-giving purpose and receive/and allocate community blessings because of such a fact. Anything less than such a blessed experience are those persons that are living the living death, and certainly, the works expressed in this book find these kinds of lives and those machinations responsible for such debasing experiences a reprehensible outrage that must be excised from civilized social life." />
