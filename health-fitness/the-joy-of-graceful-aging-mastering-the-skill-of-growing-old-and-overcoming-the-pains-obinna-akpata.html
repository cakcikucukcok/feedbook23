  <title>The Joy of Graceful Aging: Mastering the Skill of Growing Old and Overcoming the Pains - Obinna Akpata</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aging is an inevitable reality. It is often a gradual process in the last leg of our earthly life, and it is a transitory passage to the great beyond: eternal glory. It&#39;s one thing to grow old, but it&#39;s another to age gracefully in joy. In The Joy of Graceful Aging, author Obinna Akpata encourages older people to live beyond the challenges of old age, and the youths are encouraged to respect their elders for a reward of divine grace.  Rooted in biblical theology, Obinna discuses the emotional, social, and physical aspects of well-being for the elderly population. He examines the challenges that confront those who wish to live a normal life at old age. The Joy of Graceful Aging acknowledges that aging has its hopes, its loves, its thrills, and resonating moments, and that those who live the purpose-driven life have nothing to fear. They can walk in divine health with positive faith, righteousness, trust, and obedience." />
