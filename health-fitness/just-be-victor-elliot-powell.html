  <title>Just Be... - Victor Elliot Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just Be takes you on a journey of self-discovery where you come back home to yourself and find everything you thought you needed you already have. Like Dorothy in The Wizard of OZ, we often have to go far away to discover there is no place like home. And your home is within you right now, just waiting for you to find it. The opening chapter helps you define your own unique path and carries you through each chapter as you add more and more to your process and see how easy it is to come home. Everyone finds his or her own path by looking within and realizing this is the only place that the answers have ever lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your Self Power&lt;br /&gt;
The 3Rs of Being&lt;br /&gt;
Re-membering&lt;br /&gt;
The Undiscovered Self&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These core chapters move you to a state of Being where you learn that anything is possible (Infinite Possibilities). Just Be  takes you deep into the concepts of true being, unraveling the many ways that we create limits in our experiences, by living life without Being as an active part of our process. Take your journey through Life Choices, The Illusions of Time, and Joy of Coming Home to discover the magic that was always there, just waiting for you to use.&lt;/p&gt;" />
