  <title>Finding Me?And Them - Michael P. Amram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Finding meand Them: Stories of Assimilation is a collection of ten stories. They are autobiographical. They are nonfiction. They are fiction based on fact. Each story tells the authors life as an individual with or (fictional) without a disability. All of them find the author. They show different phases and challenges in his life, from rehabilitating from a head injury at age five to learning the logistics of an after-life. In ways that co-mingle genres, the stories in my book are related. There are central themes concurrent in all of them. Many of the stories are written from the perspective of someone growing up with an ambiguous disability. A theme is how I found the world to perceive me. Family is a theme. Wandering, exploration, the search for identity, are central themes in my stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My book is learning to live (physically different). Its learning to love. Its learning what faith can do and whats offered in worlds we cant see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Finding me and Them, Michael Amram shows his versatility as a writer, combining stories of fact and fiction, often with poetic lyricism, to tell the story of his life, a life he says is influenced by the disabilities caused when a distracted teen driver hit the then 5-year-old boy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, its a life that reflects Amrams abilities  his ability to see joy and sorrow in life, his ability to observe the ironies of life, his ability to appreciate that overcoming takes many forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amram blends humor and poignancy to engage readers as he portrays lifes simplest interactions as meaningful. Never preachy, each of the 10 stories in this collection teaches us something about living the fullest life we can.&lt;/p&gt;
