  <title>It’S a Wonderful Unfinished Life - Carla Kringer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our personal choices in life have profound often devastating effects on the lives others. This is the story of Jo Jo Gigliotti; he lived a wonderful, unfinished life. His daughter, Carla shares the journey her family was forced to take after they were left to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives when his life was taken by a drunk driver on April 24, 2008.  
The book is written in keeping with the vow the family made to be the voice of her dad and other victims of drinking and driving. It will take you into the heart of the tragedy where the familys healing was hindered due to the criminal proceedings involved with the prosecution of the drunk driver. Families facing a similar situation will find detailed information and resources to help them understand and navigate the complex criminal justice system. You will receive a glimpse into the roles of law enforcement, prosecutors, and defense attorneys during the prosecution of the drunk driver and the heart-wrenching toll the process takes on the family. 
Carlas life was forever changed that day. She has embraced the traumatic event a drunk driver embedded in her family history, in hope that others will gain knowledge while receiving comfort, and healing, knowing they can emerge from the darkness brought by death and grief. You may not emerge the same person you were but you can emerge a survivor with peace and hope restored in your life once again. That is Carlas wish for you as you read her fathers story and share in her familys walk through grief." />
