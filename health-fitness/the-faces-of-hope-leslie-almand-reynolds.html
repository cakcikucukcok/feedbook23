  <title>The Faces of Hope - Leslie Almand Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The journey through infertility is a nightmare, plain and simple! Whether you are ever able to have a baby on your own, or continue on to adoption, the pressure is indescribable. The sadness and loneliness are sometimes so deep that your hurt no longer remains emotional, but becomes physical as well. You dont feel like you can do this any longer. Is it even worth it? Hope is Gods gift for His children which He gives anew every morning. Our hope was realized in the adoption of our two beautiful boys, and we are so thankful we never gave up! Whether you are reading this while on the fertility scream machine or have reached the fork in the road of whether or not to adopt, we hope sharing our story with you will encourage you by knowing you are not alone, that weve been through it, survived it, and have come out of the valley of darkness. Hang in, hang on, and never lose hope!&lt;/p&gt;" />
