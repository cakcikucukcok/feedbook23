  <title>Black Swan - Diann Maree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;To be able to just sit in the moment and be fully present is empowering. Letting everything drop away; the past, the future and all judgement until there is just the now. Everything is as it should be and is in perfect order.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book is my journey.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Black Swan&lt;/i&gt;  documents my search of finding the missing pieces of my life puzzle and fitting them all back together. It is my personal journal through a six-week period in my life where I was guided (by spirit) to create transformation and take a journey of self-discovery.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The mind can create illusions. Programming of past untruths and misguided perceptions make up these illusions. It is time to step forward and become one withal again and put an end to this eternal suffering. I have subjected myself to. I know I was blinded by this illusion. It was right in front of me all the time. I just couldnt see it, until&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I was guided to:&lt;/P&gt;
 the six keys to returned me to oneness&lt;/br&gt;
 be in the moment and fully present&lt;/br&gt;
 let everything drop away  the past, the future, and no judgement; &lt;/br&gt;
 essence of being an observer of my problems; and&lt;/br&gt;
 the importance of observing my instant triggers&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When we are able to come back to the now, it is like nothing matters, there is no judgement and the possibilities are endless.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Through my journey I want to share with you, my path to self-discovery in finding Who I am and hope it inspires you to look within to find Who you are.&lt;/P&gt;" />
