      <meta name="description" content="You CAN Keep Your Dreams Alive! God has given all of us dreams and purposes. He created us for a purpose and to have dominion and rule in the earth (Genesis 1:26). This is a story about three young girls who became friends in grade school. All three of these girls had God-given dreams about walking in their purpose and impacting their community at the same time. The three girls started brain storming at a young age about what they wanted to do to impact their community. Being raised in a small town, the girls still dreamed BIG. Even in the midst of test and trials such as being raised in single parent home, family issues, or school related issue, they still desire to dream. Becoming a Nurse, Lawyer, and Teacher was a real dream for these girls and they felt as if when their dreams were fulfilled then they could impact, affect, and help the community more. This book has a great reading message and it will encourage readers to have dreams, to dream big, and to not allow anything or anyone to stop them from dreaming." />
