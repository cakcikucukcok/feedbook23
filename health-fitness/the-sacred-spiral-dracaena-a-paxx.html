  <title>The Sacred Spiral - Dracaena A. Paxx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Sacred Spiral takes a Celtic path with many Shamanic tones. However
it is a major Truth that there is no one single True Path and all symbols, as
well as mythologies resonate differently with all people. The Sacred Spiral is a
compilation of rites and explanations of hows and whys for usage, for all paths
are basically correct. Dracaena feels it is of utmost importance that a person
learn to use their intuition, and The Sacred Spiral helps guide one to do that!
She does not feel it is right for any one person to tell another whether they can
or cannot learn something! Each persons Spiritual evolution is different from
anothers! Yet work must be done to earn respect and knowledge!
Many people prefer and are very capable of learning with their own intuition.
The Sacred Spiral will help empower one to understanding many of the symbols
and visions that come to them, which a person may use this wisdom to grow!" />
