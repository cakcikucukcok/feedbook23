  <title>D.R.E.A.M.C.H.A.S.E.R: 8 Ways to Make It Happen - Lynne Kayenne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;D.R.E.A.M.C.H.A.S.E.R: 8 Ways to Make it Happen&#39;. Its aimed primarily at young people and uses examples of contemporary popular culture to hopefully inspire and motivate. I make references to song lyrics, movie quotes, biographical references from celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey, Beyonce, Rihanna, Sylvester Stallone, Michael Jordan, J.K Rowling, Lady Gaga and Jay-Z to name but a few, in an attempt to inspire, awaken, empower and help people take action towards the realisation of their dreams. I decided to use examples of celebrities who have experienced real setbacks in their personal and professional lives but went on to achieve an extraordinary amount of success. These
celebrities have been specifically chosen to relate to a youth audience and the book is written in a language and in a context that should also appeal to this audience. I want the youth of today to aspire to greatness but also see the truth behind greatness...that many of the people we view as &#39;the greats&#39; have had enormous setbacks which could easily have made them give up on their dreams but their self belief, strong work ethic, determination and desire to achieve them helped them overcome these obstacles. Actor and mega star, Will Smith once saidpeople view greatness as this unachievable thing reading D.R.E.A.M.C.H.A.S.E.R will help people realise that greatness is achievable and will also hopefully help them kick start their Dream Chase" />
