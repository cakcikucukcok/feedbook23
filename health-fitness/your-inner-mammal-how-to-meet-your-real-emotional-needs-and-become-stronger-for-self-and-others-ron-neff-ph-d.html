  <title>Your Inner Mammal: How to Meet Your Real Emotional Needs and Become Stronger-for Self and Others - Ron Neff, Ph.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your Inner Mammal takes on anxiety, anger and depression -- the major emotional maladies that afflict us in the cold, impersonal and threatening modern world. To do that, Dr. Neff builds on the concept of &quot;your inner child.&quot; That concept has served us well in mental health for many years. If you are still a child - and a lucky one -- someone else may meet your emotional needs. But not if you are an adult. Your lover doesn&#39;t want to love you as a needy child. They want - and need - a competent adult. In short, the inner child concept tells you to attend to your own emotional needs. Your Inner Mammal tells you a lot more. It tells you what those needs are. And it provides chapter after chapter of tools to meet those needs - including chapters entitled, &quot; The Importance of Being Calm,&quot; &quot;Your Angry Mammal,&quot; &quot;Your Inner Playmate,&quot; &quot; Your Inner Dancer, &quot; &quot;Getting In Touch,&quot; and &quot;You Are Part of Nature - Embrace It. &quot;" />
