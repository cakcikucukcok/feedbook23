  <title>Bipolar Shoes - Dave O&#39;Riordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This isthe story of my life living with Bipolar Disorder. After I had a major mental breakdown back in 1994 and diagnosed I found very little litrature that I could understand or relate to on my illness. Everything was over my head and quite frankly bored me to read. Even though I live with Bipolar I am a positive person who enjoys life and I want to give back.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;No one said life was going to be easy but so far for me it&#39;s been an increadible journey. I wrote this book not because I&#39;m an author but to give back to families like mine. They go through the rollercoaster ride everyday of living with a person who has a mental illness. So sit back and take a stroll with me and my &quot;Bipolar Shoes&quot; as I discribe my life with Bipolar Disorder. This is life and its supposed to be funny with some bumps along the way a book is to be informative as well as enjoyable. People have been telling me I should write a book for years. Now I finally have and I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/P&gt;" />
