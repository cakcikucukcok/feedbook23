  <title>Let&#39;s Fix Medicare, Replace Medicaid, and Repealthe Affordable Care Act - Lindsay L. Pratt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are you a Medicaid patient, or if you are a patient without any health insurance, Im aware of the difficulty you have had, and are having, obtaining your healthcare services, and I agree with you. The existing investor owned and profit driven healthcare delivery system is not a friendly delivery system for those patients unable to pay for their healthcare services. But, in its place, if you are supporting the Affordable Care Act, please reconsider your support, and consider the recommendations in this book.
In this book, Im offering everyone without the ability to pay for their healthcare services, the opportunity to obtain the same quality, comprehensive, and easily available healthcare services as the services provided patients who are purchasing their health-care services. Neither Medicaid nor the Affordable Care Act can provide those same services, and the reasons why are discussed in this book.
Furthermore, in addition to the difficulty patients with Medicaid and without Medicaid are having obtaining their healthcare services, patients with health insurance, regardless of its source, need to be prepared for the probability, not the possibility, of their having difficulty obtaining their healthcare services in two years when the Affordable Care Act becomes their healthcare delivery system.
The frustration with Medicaids inadequate services is understandable, and the confusion about the future among patients with health insurance is understandable. The problem for both is the many articles written about what is happening, and will be happening, in healthcare have not correctly identified the causes of, or offered realistic solutions for, what is happening, and will be happening, in healthcare. The problem with those articles is their misinformation and their use of conjecture. Misinformation is offered in some of those articles to support the authors agenda.
Conjecture is used by other authors. They are too young to have witnessed what happened during the 1950s and 1960s to cause what has happened in healthcare." />
