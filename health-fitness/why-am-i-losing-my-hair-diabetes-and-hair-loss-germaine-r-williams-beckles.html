  <title>Why Am I Losing My Hair?: Diabetes and Hair Loss - Germaine R Williams-Beckles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You will not find a more comprehensive and easy-to-understand book on effective ways for diabetics to slow or stop hair loss.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Germaine Williams-Beckles explains the basic reasons why diabetics frequently experience hair loss, how alopecia is affected by stress as well as circulation and weight as well as common medication interactions that impact healthy hair.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In three parts - what is diabetes, how does the disease lead to hair loss and remedies to restore healthy hair growth - Dr. Williams-Beckles uses common terms to give simple and clear advice on lifestyle and treatment options to support hair loss recovery.&amp;nbsp; There are techniques for individuals with hair loss to use at home as well as concepts that hair practitioners can use in their salons to support hair regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Bringing together all of her expertise to benefit &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;, she provides such rich advice as:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Three steps to begin treating your hair loss.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;The differences between holistic therapy outcomes and medications.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Detailed information on the best vitamins to combat problems with various type of hair loss.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;A comprehensive list for the best foods for healthy hair.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Recipes and uses for common natural products for homemade hair strengtheners and scalp treatments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;People concerned with hair loss either from personal experience or as a hair professional will learn a great deal about prevention, restoration and healthy support of the hair growth cycle - regardless if diabetes is a direct or influencing factor in the reason for hair growth cycle disruption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book is useful for anyone with hair loss.&amp;nbsp; The early chapters explain in clear language the issues with diabetes that contribute to hair loss; the sixth chapter explains ways to naturally treat hair loss that go beyond typical remedies and medications.&amp;nbsp; Dr. Williams-Beckles provides explanations of your best food choices for healthy hair, home remedies with directions on how to use natural products and gives timeframes for typical results.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The expert information and advice on healthier hair care in this book cannot be replicated by others with less training and less awards than Dr. Williams-Beckles. Her awards are far-reaching and recognize her leadership in the profession as well as her dedication to both clients and hair professionals alike.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Experts have supported her revolutionary enlightening first book:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;As three-time Best Selling Amazon author, Mia Redrick, has said, &amp;ldquo;Dr. Germaine Williams-Beckles sheds light on the true biological reasons for hair loss and damage while standing on over thirty years of experience.&amp;nbsp; She is a master of her craft who uses her education to inform, educate and inspire women globally.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;In addition, David Ibeleme, M.D. and author, has been greatly impressed with this, her first contribution to the knowledgeable on diabetes and hair care. &amp;ldquo;I was greatly impressed by the knowledge-based&amp;nbsp;details that Germaine espoused&amp;nbsp;on Diabetes Mellitus. This showed her phenomenal grasp of the condition and its effects on those who are living with it. This was probably the first book I read that implicated diabetes in detail,&amp;nbsp; with its effect on hair loss. I also believe that this &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; body of knowledge will be a welcomed inclusion to what physicians can recommend to their patients in order to improve their quality of life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you or a loved one suffer from diabetes or hair loss, you cannot afford to miss the recommendations and advice to improve your hair condition, decrease your stress and get healthier again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
