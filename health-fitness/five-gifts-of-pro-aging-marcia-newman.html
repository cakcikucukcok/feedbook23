  <title>Five Gifts of Pro-Aging - Marcia Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her timely guidebook, Boomer therapist Marcia Newman brings a fresh response to an anti-aging American culture that targets women to find their value in remaining youthful looking. Five Gifts of Pro-Aging was born out of Marcias own aging crisis and her three decades of working with women who increasingly find themselves obsessed with the insatiable practice of nip, tuck, highlight, laser, and fill. Through humor and her no-nonsense style, Marcia provides valuable tips, motivational questions, and personal stories to help you age more consciously and comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Gifts of Pro-Aging will help you to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Take stock of your own age phobia &lt;br /&gt; Uncover and recover from prolific social stigmas about growing older&lt;br /&gt; Learn about feminine carry-over behaviors and how to transform them&lt;br /&gt; Clear up unfinished business and bring honor to your maturity &lt;br /&gt; Feed your seasoned inner animal with the gift of wildness&lt;br /&gt; Join with other pro-aging women who are bringing the humane back into humanity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marcia Newman is dedicated to helping Baby Boomers pioneer healthier aging attitudes and actions. In Marcias own words, We are the perfect ones to revolutionize the aging freedom movement. It is my joy and privilege to bring this labor of love into the mix. My vision holds a brighter, more mature culture where women are able to receive full human dignity, no matter ones chronological age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
