  <title>The Immeasurable Mercy and Grace of God - O’Brien K. Awuah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was privileged to read Minister OBrien
Awuahs manuscript The Immeasurable Mercy
And Grace of God, and I am grateful I did.
This is one of the most practical, informative
and inspiring presentations on the present day
Christian life. This book has not come from
the world of psychological confi gurations;
instead it has come from a compassionate and
prayerful searching of scripture.
Gods grace, according to the author is found in Jesus Christ, and
Christ is Gods gift of Immeasurable Mercy. Yes, it is of the Lords
immeasurable mercies and grace that we are not consumed, because
his compassions fail not. They are new every morning: Great is thy
faithfulness (Lamentations 3:22-23).
Gods immeasurable mercy and grace though abounding create and
demand a change in our lives. Therefore, my Christian friends, I
challenge you to read chapter eight (8) of the book over and over again
and your life will never be the same. You will not only be blessed; you
will be a blessing." />
