  <title>Nutrition and Weight Control Simplified - John Houston Batchelor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have always been interested in good health, but was never quite sure what that was. Like most people, I would just hear a little something from whomever and accept that as fact.
I spent my life working two jobs, struggling with bills, raising a family and trying to find ways to enjoy my life as well and I suspect that many others do and have done the same.
24/7, we are bombarded with nonsense from many quarters, most of it from money mongers that would fleece us out of our hard earned money.
This is not restricted to nutrition and weight control, but many other things as well.
We are attacked from all sides, T.V. commercials, cooking shows that have no interest in our health, only what money they can make by showing us how to cook in an unhealthy and irresponsible way.
I think that I have compiled some useful information, not only for myself, but information that may help many, many others, I feel like I have discovered the Holy Grail.
I hope you find it useful as well. I suspect that 99% of people that read my little book will find many things that they didnt know before and improve their own lives, as well as avoiding much of the nonsense and wasting time and money chasing those magic rainbows.
It is much simpler than you might think." />
