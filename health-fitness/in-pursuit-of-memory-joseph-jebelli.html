  <title>In Pursuit of Memory - Joseph Jebelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;For readers of Atul Gawande, Siddhartha Mukherjee, and Henry  Marsh, a riveting, gorgeously written biography of one of history&#39;s most  fascinating and confounding diseases--Alzheimer&#39;s--from its discovery  more than 100 years ago to today&#39;s race towards a cure.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SHORTLISTED FOR THE ROYAL SOCIETY SCIENCE BOOK PRIZE 2017&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LONG-LISTED FOR THE 2017 WELLCOME BOOK PRIZE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;NAMED &quot;SCIENCE BOOK OF THE MONTH&quot; BY &lt;i&gt;BOOKSELLER&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alzheimer&#39;s is the great global epidemic of our time, affecting millions worldwide -- there are more than 5 million people diagnosed in the US alone. And as our population ages, scientists are working against the clock to find a cure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neuroscientist Joseph Jebelli is among them. His beloved grandfather had Alzheimer&#39;s and now he&#39;s written the book he needed then -- a very human history of this frightening disease. But In Pursuit of Memory is also a thrilling scientific detective story that takes you behind the headlines. Jebelli&#39;s quest takes us from nineteenth-century Germany and post-war England, to the jungles of Papua New Guinea and the technological proving grounds of Japan; through America, India, China, Iceland, Sweden, and Colombia. Its heroes are scientists from around the world -- many of whom he&#39;s worked with -- and the brave patients and families who have changed the way that researchers think about the disease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This compelling insider&#39;s account shows vividly why Jebelli feels so hopeful about a cure, but also why our best defense in the meantime is to understand the disease. In Pursuit of Memory is a clever, moving, eye-opening guide to the threat one in three of us faces now.&lt;br&gt;" />
