  <title>Intimacy with God - Grace-Jane Nkolika Ilonuba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book, Intimacy with God is a reminder of the fact that life without a close relationship with God is a losing game. God created us to have one on one relationship with Him, which is why He created us in His image and likeness. We do not own ourselves. Our life is a gift from God and we must live this brief lifespan with a sense of responsibility and purpose. God is not just a factor of life; He is the very source of life. Apostle Paul declares: &amp;ldquo;In him we live and move and have our being&amp;rdquo; (Acts 17:28). This means outside of Him, we are just like the flower that blossoms in the morning and withers in the noonday, or like the chaff which is tossed to and fro by the wind, there is no us without him.&lt;br /&gt;
The book also explores the blessings of enjoying intimate relationship with God, which is enormous, and attempts to encourage the reader to seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, which is the prerequisite for enjoying every other divine blessing including destiny fulfillment and eternal life. We must seek God earnestly, the bible tells us in Jeremiah 29:13, &amp;ldquo;you will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart.&lt;br /&gt;
Destiny is the sum-total of what you were created to accomplish in life. And it takes a close walk with the Lord to discover and fulfill it. God made you as a precious treasure for a divine purpose, therefore by walking closely with Him you get stabilized in the journey of life. God wants us to know Him and His love, His mercy, His goodness, His righteousness, etc. in a very personal and real ways, so this book is a call to pay attention to the expectation of God for your life, and to know God for yourself. Therefore, if you have ever longed for God in your heart, to know Him in a special&amp;nbsp;and personal way - this book is for you. If you have ever prayed &amp;lsquo;Father, show me your glory, this book is for you. If you have ever wondered what would become of your life, maybe you have been confused about matters of your destiny all this while - this book is for you. If you have ever entertained fear for eternity, not knowing whether you will make heaven or hell - this book is for you. If you are going through a hard time and you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to turn - this book is for you.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever condition you have found yourself in, whether convenient or not, this book is for you. The bible states that you shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free.&amp;nbsp; And I believe you will be greatly inspired and blessed as you read this book with a praying heart. An encounter with God will change your life for good&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
