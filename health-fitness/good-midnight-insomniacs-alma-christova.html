  <title>Good Midnight, Insomniacs - Alma Christova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Good Midnight, Insomniacs is a spontaneous collage of life-writing and photographs put together in one breath and hastening to document the early stages of the authors recovery from addiction and depression. No matter who you are - a man or a woman, young or old, rich or poor, black or white, your addiction wants to take your life. Period. The Three Headed Dragon wants you dead. Alma Christovas modest self-help booklet is dedicated to intervention and addresses people who decided to conquer one of 21st centurys deadliest pandemics. As the proverbial slogan of Alcoholics Anonymous goes: You are no longer alone, it is her firm belief that in todays cyber era there is no excuse for silencing mental health issues and chronic addiction pathology, no reason for isolation and despair in the wee hours of the morning. Almas personal collection of sunrise pictures taken over the first six months of her recovery sends the symbolic message of hope for a new daybreak to fellow addicts and insomniacs. The essays are simply a continuation of her gratitude letter to The Addictions and Concurrent Disorders Centre at the Credit Valley Hospital in Mississauga and depict her personal awakening as a direct result from its multifaceted support. The acquired knowledge has empowered the author beyond words (here come the pictures!) and has opened widely a new road to yet another journey of healing and discovery." />
