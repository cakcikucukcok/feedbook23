  <title>Parenthood by Proxy - Dr. Laura Schlessinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following her previous &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers, Dr.Laura Schlessinger, the conscience of talk radio, now addresses an issue near and dear to her heart: the stupid things parents do to mess up their children. Never one to shy away from tough truths, Dr. Laura marshals compelling evidence for the widespread neglect of America&#39;s children and convincingly condemns the numerous rationalizations to excuse it. These are just a few of her hard-hitting points:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don&#39;t Have Them If You Won&#39;t Raise Them: &quot;The cavalier manner in which our society treats child care, not as a matter of intimacy and love, but as a matter of convenience and economics, is deeply destructive to our children&#39;s sense of attachment, identity, and importance.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dads Need Not Apply: &quot;Single motherhood may be more acceptable to society, but it is not acceptable to children; nor is it in their best interest.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brave New Baby: &quot;In our society, reproductive freedom means anyone can decide to create a life by any means with no, and I mean no, consideration of what is in the best interest of that new human being.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spare the Rod: &quot;Children without discipline often become adults with tempertantrums, defiance, rage, depression, anxiety, poor school and work adjustment, drug and alcohol abuse.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stupid Things Parents Do to Mess Up Their Kids&lt;/em&gt; covers all aspects of parenting and also tackles such cultural and societal concerns as abortion, modern sexuality, drug and alcohol use, violence, discipline, and a child&#39;s right to privacy." />
