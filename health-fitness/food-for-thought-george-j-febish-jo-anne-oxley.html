  <title>Food for Thought - George J. Febish, Jo Anne Oxley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Food For Thought: An Epigenetic Guide to Wellness&quot; By George J. Febish and Jo Anne Oxley &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;B&gt;You Make Your Own Luck! &lt;br&gt;
How to Change Your Health Luck!&lt;br&gt;
We have more Control Than we Think!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
American health is getting worse and people actually believe that getting old equates to getting ill. Co-authors George J. Febish and Jo Anne Oxley declare that this is absolutely not true. People are empowered to be as healthy as they can be. People do not have good or bad genes. The problem is that genes are being turned ON or OFF, which causes health or illness. In Food For Thought: An Epigenetic Guide to Wellness, the authors reveal what turns genes on and off and how people can control these switches. 
In this book, readers can explore two new fields of biology that impact the quality of life. Epigenetics is the study of how human genes are switched on and off. For example, cancer genes can either be turned on or off and tumor fighting genes can be turned on or off. Nutrigenomics is the study of how different foods cause epigenetic switches to our genes. It is a mapping of which foods switch on or off which genes.
The state of ones health is not random nor is it luck. It is the sum of all the decision a person makes in his of her life. It includes foods eaten and those not eaten, how one thinks, what one believes in as well as the physical environment one lives in. Food For Thought: An Epigenetic Guide to Wellness will teach readers how they can control life changing switches to improve their health, lifestyle, and mental attitude. Each one is responsible for his or her health. Doctors and the government are not responsible. Making the right decisions and living a better life is everybodys choice." />
