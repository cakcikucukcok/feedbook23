  <title>A Few Good Eggs - Julie Vargo, Maureen Regan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Insight and frank, friendly advice on overcoming infertility -- from two women who have lived through it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are bombarded by images of blissful older mothers, such as Madonna and Celine Dion. But &#39;Hollywood&#39; articles about pregnancy and fertility at middle age gloss over the tremendous amount of financial, emotional, and physical effort faced by couples struggling to conceive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this warm, funny, empathetic book, journalist Julie Vargo and literary agent Maureen Regan -- women who have experienced personally almost every aspect of infertility -- give readers a glimpse into what to expect when you&#39;re not expecting. Hormones, sperm counts -- nothing is too personal for these two outspoken women!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranges from technical to humorous and everything in between. What are good, snappy comebacks to the question, &#39;Why aren&#39;t you pregnant?&#39; What is the difference between gonadotrophin releasing hormone and progesterone? Should you freeze your eggs? These questions and many more are answered, and in the tone of a couple of good friends. Between them, the authors have gone through hormone treatments, miscarriages and multiple inseminations -- so they know firsthand the rollercoaster ride of trying to achieve pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With wise advice on how to communicate with doctors, husbands, friends, and mothers, this book is an invaluable guide for all women facing infertility.&lt;/p&gt;" />
