  <title>Anxiety Management for Kids on the Autism Spectrum - Christopher Lynch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anxiety can be overwhelming for children with autism. It doesn’t need to be. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The anxiety levels commonly found in children with autism affect social skills, memory, learning, and attention span—and often lead to meltdowns. Those who live or work with kids on the spectrum are acutely aware of how disruptive anxiety can be. However, we are rarely provided with clear guidance on how to manage this anxiety. This book bridges that gap. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Through his twenty-plus years as a clinical psychologist, Dr. Lynch has devoted his career to relieving distress in kids with autism and related disorders. Lynch identifies five factors that are commonly known to elicit anxiety in children with autism and breaks down how to tackle each topic in a manageable and effective way. These factors include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;li&gt; Rigidity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Sensory Sensitivities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Social Challenges&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Communication Barriers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; Task Frustration&lt;/li&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this clear and comprehensive guide, parents, teachers, and therapists can take the first crucial step towards managing anxiety, relieving distress, and unlocking potential. &lt;/p&gt;" />
