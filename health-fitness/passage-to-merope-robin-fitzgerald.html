  <title>Passage to Merope - Robin Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A wild romp to the stars and back with a throw together crew who continue to amaze as the story progresses. This first of three, introduces the space-craft Avatar. This ship built by Alfa-reticulans, has features that span all the way to the final scenes of &#39;Agents of a New Atlantis&#39;. I plan to have this publication offered for free at the 2018 Dulce Conference with your ticket purchase. It was also a part of the 2015 UFO Conference. A lot of the description of Dulce came from the person who put on that Conference, Norio H. His investigating has led everyone to believe the military are indeed involved. This book explains as to what extent they are. The story in &#39;Agents&#39; reveals that in November of 2017 they went from &#39;looking the other way&#39;, to, &#39;assisting the Light-forces&#39;. There&#39;s a dramatic difference between those two agendas. This is the story to start with for the uninitiated." />
