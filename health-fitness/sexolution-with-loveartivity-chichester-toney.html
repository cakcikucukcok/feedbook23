  <title>Sexolution with Loveartivity - Chichester Toney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sexolution with Loveartivity presents a collection of experimental poems inspired by real life, real people, and real sex. 
Author Chichester Toney interviewed men and women in search of a balanced perspective on the many sides of sexuality and romance. The people he worked with are just regular peoplepeople like you who work hard to put food on the table, keep roofs over their heads, and keep some heat in the bedroom. Many people live unfulfilled livespeople who are smart, attractive, and have a lot to give, but just arent happy when it comes to their romantic or intimate lives. 
This collection of poetry was inspired by the experiences of Toney and his close associates. Like life, it unfolds without structure or formal research.  
Fulfilling your love life and sexuality is a lifelong opportunity. You may seek to change your overall view and perception about sexor not. Love and sexuality can only be understood when aspects of self and sex, sex and feelings, sex and intimacy, sex and religion, and sex and culture are fully explored and integrated. This collection explores these parameters in a subtle and poetic manner. It is a true experiment of all the aforementioned dimensions of love and sexuality. In a nutshell, it is love in its three dimensions: agape, eros, and philia." />
