  <title>Considering Weight Loss Surgery - Glenn M. Ihde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For patients considering weight loss surgery, there is an enormous amount of information to know. In a very few short years, the number of options for surgery have increased. Patients undergoing surgery need to know their surgical options, how they compare in outcomes and risks, and how to prepare before and after surgery. In addition, the dietary changes necessary after weight loss surgery require a significant amount of education. Patients need a resource to turn to when looking for appropriate foods to eat and when evaluating the foods that they want to eat. Education is the key to succeeding with weight loss surgery. Covering all this information is impossible in a single visit to your physician, or even after several visits. Considering Weight Loss Surgery is a resource for both the patient and for the physician. It serves to organize the information that needs to pass from surgeon to patient, and acts as a longstanding reference to patients well after they have had surgery. By standardizing the educational process and providing a reference for patients, better outcomes and better understanding can be obtained." />
