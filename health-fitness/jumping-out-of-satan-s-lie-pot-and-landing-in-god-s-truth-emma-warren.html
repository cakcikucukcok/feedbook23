  <title>Jumping out of Satan’S Lie Pot and Landing in God’S Truth - Emma Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you feel mired in the pit of hopelessness, helplessness, and despair? Do you struggle in your everyday Christian walk? In Jumping Out of Satans Lie Pot and Landing in Gods Truth, author Emma Warren uses her thirty-five-year, roller-coaster battle with depression to show you how to crawl out of the pit and land in Gods grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the principles of the Word of God, Jumping Out of Satans Lie Pot and Landing in Gods Truth unpacks the nine lies Satan perpetrated on Emma during her struggles with depression, such as depression is a physical illness, and it must be treated by doctors and pills; dying is the only way out; and God doesnt love you. She discusses the temporary solutions she used to deal with her depression, details how God brought her out of the pit, and tells how she landed in Gods truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmas testimony describes how Satan robbed her of joy, peace, contentment, and love, and how Gods truth set her free one lie at a time. Jumping Out of Satans Lie Pot and Landing in Gods Truth communicates how God has blessed her tenfold and more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
