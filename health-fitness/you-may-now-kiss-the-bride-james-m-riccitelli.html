  <title>You May Now Kiss the Bride - James M. Riccitelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You May Now Kiss the Bride&lt;/em&gt; tells how to transition successfully from courtship ecstasy to married bliss. The author points out what a couple may expect after the kiss, the reception, and the honeymoon, and how to deal Christianly with problems that inevitably develop because of the new intimate relationship. He explains why a couple, after a few months of married life, may be puzzled and ask themselves, Is this the same person I knew in courtship? He then offers solutions that are guaranteed to work because their source is the Bible.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Already married? &lt;em&gt;You May Now Kiss the Bride&lt;/em&gt; also makes clear what to do to recapture the joy of married life and turn an unhappy marriage around. A damaged marriage heading for divorce can be repaired! The author explains how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus said divorce is unnecessary, and &lt;em&gt;You May Now Kiss the Bride&lt;/em&gt; explains why Jesus spoke the exception clause and what He meant by it. The book also presents simple diagrams illustrating authority and submission, why males and females handle problem-solving differently, and how the definition of love differs when female, male, or God uses the word.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You May Now Kiss the Bride&lt;/em&gt; is ideal for both pre-marital and post-wedding counseling. Any person desiring stronger personal relationships with others can also profit from this book. The biblical principles set forth and the techniques to implement them are simple but effective.&lt;/p&gt;" />
