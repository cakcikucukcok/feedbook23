  <title>Falling In Love When You Thought You Were Through: A Love Story - Jill Robinson, Stuart Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Jill Robinson, the author of &lt;em&gt;Past Forgetting&lt;/em&gt;, comes a true story, coauthored with her husband, the English writer Stuart Shaw, about finding love when they both thought they were through with romance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Stuart and Jill first met, neither felt like a poster child for serious love. Stuart was recovering from the alcoholism that had wrecked his marriage and ravaged his career. Jill was recovering from a second failed marriage and believed she was done with love forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then, in a crowded Connecticut diner, at about midnight, Jill caught Stuart&#39;s eye and shot him a look that said, &lt;em&gt;I&#39;m designed for you&lt;/em&gt;. Immediately drawn to Jill, Stuart asked, &lt;em&gt;Would you like to come to my place for a cup of tea sometime?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What follows is a journey toward commitment. You hear it from both points of view: his and hers. If you&#39;ve ever felt that your opportunity for love was gone, here&#39;s the lively story of the creation of a passionate marriage that will fill your heart with joy and hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
