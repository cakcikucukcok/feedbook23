  <title>Fasting Diet For Beginners: Easy and Fast Dieting Tips For Weight Loss and Healthy Living - Brittany Samons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A fasting diet is basically indulging in a diet plan that limits the amount of calories that you take in a day. It may also be a diet that completely prohibits eating anything just like what the name suggests. But since it is impossible even for a healthy person to not eat anything and still function at home and at work, proponents of countless fasting diet versions have come up with their best approaches to fasting. One such method is fasting intermittently. Intermittent fasting is eating less than the amount of calories that you usually take in a day while eating the usual way in some days. People that have actually tried the an intermittent plan agree that this is one of the best ways to lose weight." />
