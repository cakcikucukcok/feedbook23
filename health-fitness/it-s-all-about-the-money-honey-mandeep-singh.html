  <title>It’S All About the Money Honey! - Mandeep Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether you accept it or not - &#39;Dowry&#39; has become a curse in our country and the time has come to fight it, using the very same &#39;mentality&#39; of dowry seekers. The worst part about dowry is that it has been strategically linked to &#39;Pride&#39;. On one hand you have the groom&#39;s father boasting about the dowry amount received, (basking in the pride of his son&#39;s ability of attracting such an amount) and on the other hand, you have the girls father, who pays that &#39;Dowry&#39; with pride, believing it is his way of expressing his love for his daughter.
Dowry today, has moved to a fairly advanced stage and is being conducted in many different &amp; creative ways. The groom is treated like a &#39;Product&#39;, with the attributes and features that satisfies the needs and wants of the &#39;Consumer&quot; - namely the bride&#39;s family. Both parties decide to form a relation, either as a &#39;Merger&#39; or an &#39;Acquisition&#39; - based on their abilities to do either. All parents are (unknowingly) following typical market strategies that a Product company uses to promote their wares in the market  which includes amongst other things, listing its attributes and features in a bid to attract prospective buyers  who conduct an Evaluation before finally making a Purchase." />
