  <title>In Good Hands - David Hechler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How can you be sure that your child in day care is safe? &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; a)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The day care I chose was highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt; b)&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s fully licensed and government-approved.&lt;br /&gt; c)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; My son&amp;rsquo;s provider loves him as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt; d)&amp;nbsp; All of the above.&lt;br /&gt; e)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; None of the above.&lt;br /&gt; The correct answer is &amp;ldquo;none of the above.&amp;rdquo; Recommendations may be helpful in selecting a facility, but they&amp;rsquo;re no assurance your child will be safe. The government may check, but you can&amp;rsquo;t count on the government to effectively monitor day care. And banking on a provider&amp;rsquo;s good will is no substitute for your own watchful eyes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Good Hands is a book about the importance of safe day care. It&amp;rsquo;s also the story of one family day care that parents loved even after a baby died. They continued to drop off their children after a second infant died in the home. Doctors ruled that both children were victims of sudden infant death syndrome, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t stop the police from launching a criminal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What followed was a medical and psychological mystery that divided a South Carolina community. The twists and turns rival the best crime fiction. Three murder trials over six years didn&amp;rsquo;t answer all the questions&amp;mdash;or banish lingering doubts.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; This is a book full of questions. There is still disagreement about what happened in that home, and who (if anyone) was responsible. The book also explores the challenges parents face when hiring a caregiver, and the emotional bonds they sometimes develop that can make severing the relationship agonizing&amp;mdash;even when children&amp;rsquo;s lives may be at stake.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is also a book filled with answers. It offers a wealth of advice from experts who urge parents not to assume that their job is done after they select a facility. That&amp;rsquo;s when the real work begins.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Appendix at the end of the text features interviews with two therapists. As the second interview makes clear, the lessons in these pages aren&amp;rsquo;t limited to parents of young children. They are just as valuable for people seeking safe care for other vulnerable individuals, like the elderly or people with disabilities. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
