  <title>50 Rules Kids Won&#39;t Learn in School - Charles J. Sykes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charles J. Sykes offers fifty life lessons not included in the self-esteem-laden, reality-light curriculum of most schools. Here are truths about what kids will encounter in the world post-schooling, and ideas for how parents can reclaim lost ground---not with pep talks and touchy-feely negotiations, but with honesty and respect. Sykes&#39;s rules are frank, funny, and tough minded, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#1  Life is not fair. Get used to it. &lt;br&gt;#7  If you think your teacher is tough, wait until you get a boss. He doesn&#39;t have tenure, so he tends to be a bit edgier. When you screw up, he&#39;s not going to ask you how you FEEL about it. &lt;br&gt;#15  Flipping burgers is not beneath your dignity. Your grandparents had a different word for burger flipping. They called it &quot;opportunity.&quot;&lt;br&gt;#42  Change the oil. &lt;br&gt;#43  Don&#39;t let the success of others depress you.&lt;br&gt;#48  Tell yourself the story of your life. Have a point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each rule is explored with wise, pithy examples that parents, grandparents, and teachers can use to help children help themselves succeed---in school and out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few rules kids won&#39;t learn in school:&lt;br&gt;#9  Your school may have done away with winners and losers. Life hasn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;#14  Looking like a slut does not empower you.&lt;br&gt;#29  Learn to deal with hypocrisy.&lt;br&gt;#32  Television is not real life.&lt;br&gt;#38  Look people in the eye when you meet them.&lt;br&gt;#47  You are not perfect, and you don&#39;t have to be.&lt;br&gt;#50  Enjoy this while you can.&lt;/p&gt;" />
