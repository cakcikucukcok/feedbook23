  <title>How to Seduce a Man - Giusi Maugeri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is meant for all those women who want to discover new secrets to draw men attention and to be courted. The book tells you why, to be great seducers, it doesn&amp;#39;t matter being beautiful: there are many helpful tips you can follow to make the man you want worship at your altar! Learn all about how to dress, what to say, what to do when you like a man, how make him understand it, how to tell if he likes you by simple gestures and words, how to draw his attention, how to make him fall in love, what to do on a first date, how to make the most of you, how to overcome complexes, how to become sexier, all the mistakes to avoid and finally... the secret of the perfect seductress!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Preface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a man and maybe this book is not meant for me&amp;quot;, a male reader, as who writes, might think... nothing wronger! Here, finally revealed all the secrets thanks to which women seduce us, make us do whatever they want, in a few words, command us (but giving us the impression to be free...).&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;All this is written in one book?! Perhaps I may sneak a peak, then!&amp;quot;... well, we&amp;#39;re getting somewhere!&lt;br /&gt;
Not to mention the women readers, to which the ebook is aimed specifically: get ready to discover a lot of practical and real tips (and very often, really simple to realize!) to become masters of seduction, as you were born &amp;quot;seductress&amp;quot;. Scarlett Johansson, Megan Fox, Jennifer Lawrence, Katy Perry, Mila Kunis, Marilyn Monroe? After reading this book you will do better&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Learn how to&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;bull; conquer the hunk that seems unreachable (but he is not!)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; make him fall in love!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; be beautiful even when you feel ugly&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; understand if he really likes you&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; succeed on the first date&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; make him call you after the first date&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; have full lips, white teeth and a body capable of seducing&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; manage the relationship with his family (and his mother...)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; keep alive the desire in your relationship.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The author does not waste time to preach at you and goes straight to the point: you&amp;#39;ll find a never-ending series of real-life situations (in which all women and men, newly engaged and aficionados of dating found ourselves, sooner or later!) narrated and commented with biting irony and a critical sense which leaves no room for doubt or second thoughts: do you want to seduce? Do as she says!&lt;br /&gt;
Discover the Secrets of Seduction revealed at the end of each chapter and... during the reading of this book, sometimes you&amp;#39;ll feel like being in an episode of Friends or Sex and the City; some other times in the most romantic scene of the most romantic of your favorite romantic movie; still others in your own memories... memories of missed opportunities or achievements (the author has a collection of both and she will share theme with you!) from which take example to finally get what you want: make him worship at your altar!" />
