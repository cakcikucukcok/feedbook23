  <title>The Little Red Handbook of Life - Vince Calandra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We live busy lives. The day is done in the blink of an eye. We sleep. Then we get to do it all over again. This is the treadmill of life. Millions, perhaps billions, of people live this life. For the so-called successful the small amounts of open time in their calendar are filled with things. The things may be the next event, the next party, the next trip, the next school event, the next social dinner, and on and on. Largely, we pretend to have fun in these brief moments. It is quite evident that those who live busy lifestyles lack any presence in the moment to truly experience and enjoy those items we place on the open slots in the calendar of our life.
Why read this handbook of life? No one gives you a handbook to life. The goal of this book is to serve as a guide to help your life be a far fuller and joyful one. That your days will be infinitely better than the step-and-repeat days you are experiencing in todays modern world.
In summary, this handbook is perhaps the greatest gift one human being can give to another. These simple wisdom and truths will enrich each and every day of your life." />
