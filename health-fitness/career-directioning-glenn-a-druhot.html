  <title>Career Directioning - Glenn A. Druhot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;CAREER DIRECTIONING&quot;
Career Directioning is a method of seeking your perfect job based upon y
our values, abilities and personality  not just another job  The purpose of this book is to assist you in discovering the best right career for you. If you are searching for a more satisfying career, have been downsized, feel as though by changing jobs you will increase your earning power or you are starting your first job search the techniques in this book will help.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book is designed in a workbook format to assist you in your career management.  You will find that each chapter builds on the previous chapter. The book begins by describing the emotional stages that we go through whenever there is a job loss.  Then it proceeds to describe the ways to discover your perfect job.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its truly amazing how many of us lose sight of what we once were planning on doing with our career or worse yet have difficulty in describing what our ideal job would look like. I have spent my career listening to people say how dissatisfied they were with their jobs and careers. When I ask them what their passion is they often cannot answer what that could be. Do you know what your passion is for an occupation?  Are you living the life that you want? Are you employed in a position that is unfulfilling?  Are you looking for a career change?  Have you been a victim of downsizing? It has been said that the only true success in life is to have lived life in your own way.  What would life be like if you lived your life in your own way?  When was the last time that you thought about it?  Did you have a dream like most of us as you were growing up to be or to do something and life got in the way?  Wouldnt it be wonderful if you could get up tomorrow and go to work in a position where you would feel as though you are contributing something to the organization?  Or being employed where you are appreciated for what you do?  Or better yet, work in a position that you know you are making a difference?  Life is too short to spend time in a career that is not fulfilling. Too many people ask themselves what kind of job or career would be best for them. Why is it that we focus on the what rather than the how? Well, it is possible, but you must make it happen.  You cant wait for employers to come to you. You have to take charge of the direction of your career direction yourself.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What is your rationale for reading this book?  Could it be one of the following?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	You are searching for a more satisfying career. &lt;br&gt;
	You have been downsized from a job.&lt;br&gt;
	You are starting you first job search.&lt;br&gt;
	Feelings like your opportunities for growth are limited where you are presently.&lt;br&gt;
	There is a basic conflict of values on the job.&lt;br&gt;
	You are a Baby Boomer and are now seeking a career that you hope will be more satisfying than what you have done so far in life.&lt;br&gt;
	There has been a significant life event that is propelling you to make a career change.  It could be something like a near death experience, divorce, turning 40 or 50, or physically unable to do the job that you have done in the past.&lt;br&gt; 
	You feel as though by changing jobs you will increase your earning power.
&lt;br&gt;	You would like to pursue a dream or complete a mission.
	Maybe you were fired or laid off and need to make a career change.&lt;br&gt;
	You have retired and now are seeking a rewarding career that you would enjoy more.&lt;br&gt;
	You have climbed the corporate ladder and your priorities have changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Often we allow corporations or organizations to manage our careers.  In my private career coaching practice I have helped literally thousands of individuals who have allowed corporations to totally control their lives and when they have been job eliminated or the company is acquired by another public traded corporation they find themselves searching for a new direction with their career.
