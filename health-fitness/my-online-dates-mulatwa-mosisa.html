  <title>My Online Dates - Mulatwa Mosisa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My online date from German is a middle aged man. I didnt know why he wanted to date me. He introduced himself as a young man fi rst. The next day, he asked me if I like him. I told him he was a good guy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Will you hate me if I tell you something? asked Gunter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I wont. I said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Im not a young man as I told you Im sixty four. I was shocked but&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
pretended as if I was not surprised. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Its okay. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You dont hate me if I invite you my webcam and show you how old I am? Please dont sign out when you see me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I wont. Dont worry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He sends the invite, and I accepted him and saw a very older man with bushy face and chest. He could be my grandfather; I wanted to know more about him. What does he want to do with me? I cant tell how I was embarrassed to see his face on the cam. Unless he wants to adopt me as a granddaughter, he has no purpose to chase a girl of my age. Anyway, I let him finish his talk." />
