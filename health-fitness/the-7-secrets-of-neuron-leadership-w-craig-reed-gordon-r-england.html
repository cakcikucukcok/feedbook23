  <title>The 7 Secrets of Neuron Leadership - W. Craig Reed, Gordon R. England</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leadership techniques backed by the world&#39;s most effective teams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 7 Secrets of Neuron Leadership&lt;/i&gt; offers a diverse collection of wisdom and practical knowledge to help you build and lead your most effective team yet. Written by a former U.S. Navy diver, this book draws from the author&#39;s experiences and beyond to reveal key truths about the nature of teamwork, and expose the core of effective team leadership. You&#39;ll go back to ancient Greece to discover the nine personality types and the seven types of love that form the foundation of human interaction, and learn how to use this wisdom as a scaffold for communication within your own team. You&#39;ll mine the latest neuroscience research as you delve into the Triune Brain and personality neurotransmitters, and explore the biological hardwiring that can be finessed and focused to achieve results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout, you&#39;ll gain insightful perspective from military and business leaders about what does—and doesn&#39;t—work in the real world; discussions with a former head of NASA, a Deputy Secretary of Defense, Navy SEAL officers, two Secretaries of the Navy, and dozens of CEOs, executives, researchers, and renowned world leaders provide invaluable advice backed by a track record of success.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Gain insight from top business and military leaders&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explore ancient Greek philosophy on team building&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover helpful truths from modern neuroscience research&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn to communicate, educate, and motivate more effectively&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Effective teamwork begins with building the right team, and leading with the right kind of leadership for that particular team. &lt;i&gt;The 7 Secrets of Neuron Leadership&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to put the right players in place and give them the support, guidance, and direction they need to bring home exceptional results.&lt;/p&gt;" />
