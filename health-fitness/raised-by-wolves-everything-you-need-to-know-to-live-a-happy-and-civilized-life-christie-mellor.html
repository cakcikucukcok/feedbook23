  <title>Raised by Wolves: Everything You Need to Know to Live a Happy and Civilized Life - Christie Mellor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hilarious guide for those raised by wolves, born in a barn, or otherwise unacquainted with the standard rules of adulthood&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, young adults with a modicum of social skills and the basic know-how to run a household were let loose upon a grateful world. But no longer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did this come about? Why are so-called &quot;grown-ups&quot; often unable to make their beds and clean up their own kitchens? Perhaps Mom shouldn&#39;t have done all of Junior&#39;s science projects for him. Maybe Dad should have made Tiffany take that summer job in college instead of paying her way through Europe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But fear not! Christie Mellor is here to help you prepare for the real world with essential skills like these:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to poach a chicken (and what to do with it when you&#39;re done)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to make the perfect martini&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Twenty-five amazing uses for baking soda&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How not to annoy your friends when you break up with your boyfriend&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so much more! In short, here&#39;s everything you need to know in order to jump into the deep end of the pool with the rest of the adults.&lt;/p&gt;" />
