  <title>I Thought We&#39;d Never Speak Again - Laura Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her classic books &lt;em&gt;The Courage to Heal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Allies in Healing,&lt;/em&gt; Laura Davis helped millions cope with the trauma of child sexual abuse. Her supportive guide &lt;em&gt;Becoming the Parent You Want to Be&lt;/em&gt; taught parents to create a vision for their families. Now, in &lt;em&gt;I Thought We&amp;#39;d Never Speak Again,&lt;/em&gt; she tackles another critical, emerging issue: reconciling relationships sundered by betrayal, anger, and misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her trademark clarity and compassion, Davis maps the reconciliation process through gripping firstperson stories of people who have reconciled under a wide variety of difficult circumstances. In these pages, parents reconcile with children, embittered siblings reconnect, estranged friends reunite, and war veterans and crime victims meet with their enemies. Davis weaves these powerful accounts with her own experiences reconciling with her mother after a long, painful estrangement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making a crucial distinction between reconciliation and forgiveness, Davis explains how people can make peace in relationships without necessarily forgiving past hurts. Step by step, she clarifies the qualities needed for reconciliation-including maturity, discernment, determination, courage, communication, and compassion. To help readers gauge their own readiness, she includes a self-assessment entitled &amp;#34;Are You Ready for Reconciliation?&amp;#34; as well as a special section called &amp;#34;Ideas for Reflection and Discussion.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On each page of this inspiring and instructive book, Laura Davis offers hope and help for reconciliation between individuals, and in the larger human family, sharing essential keys for resolving troubled relationships and finding peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
