  <title>Thoughts That Feed the Resilient Mind - Dr. Robin R. Laysears-Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thoughts that Feed the Resilient Mind offers inspirational, challenging affirmations and provoking ideas to nurture the resilient mind. These thoughts provide enhancement to self-empowerment, spiritual awareness, and alternative ways of thinking and responding to life. The words in this work can help you maintain resiliency through adverse, traumatic, and difficult times. It may inspire you to respond with positive actions, uplift you, encourage you, and transcend your thoughts to feed the resilient mind.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a guide for anyone wanting to stay resilient through unwanted events, such as loss of a job, a loved one, or a troubled relationship, or having trouble staying resilient when things do not go as planned.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;One may ask, &quot;How often does one have to practice resiliency in order to count resiliency as an attribute to their character?&quot;Resilience is necessary to grow through recovery and life&#39;s challenges and uncomfortable situations. It is imperative that we respond and not react. Responding takes effort and application of spiritual principles such as love, forgiveness, and trust. Reacting usually results in needing forgiveness for inappropriate responses. We are responsible for our own healing, learning, and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editorial Reviews:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr. Robin R. Laysears-Smith expertly guides you through a spiritual and inspirational roadmap for life in her small but powerful book &lt;i&gt;Thoughts That Feed The Resilient Mind&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She covers everything from self-esteem to forgiveness to family and work relationships to a person&#39;s relationship to God by utilizing her own beliefs and words as well as the stories and quotes of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is quick and easy read that gives one a lot to ponder. Reading it will help you to positively build your own road to resilience. It should be an important part of any library having to do with self growth. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Beatrice S. Lazaroff, Psychologist&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;The fundamentals presented in this book are the key to success. Dr. Robin Laysears-Smith is a master of them. Read her book, but most importantly, use it!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milton Brown, Ed.M, Retired School Principal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;We all questioned, either to ourselves or to others, why do I feel that something bad always happens to me. Some people go through this time quickly, almost as if it was a short trip. They are back, thinking positively, embracing their future, their spirituality, their family, friends and careers stronger than ever.  Yet others take an extended vacation in their feelings of despair and negativity. The key to the return trip is resiliency. Dr. Laysears-Smith shares with us how you can develop a resilient mind and outlook on your situation. By using positive affirmations, stories that inspire and teach, and methods that develop resilient thinking, the reader can take control of a situation and begin to frame their life in a more positive manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing Robin as I do, she embodies the qualities that she describes so vividly in her book. She is infectious in her laughter, caring for others, and has a deep mission for others to be successful. When she told me she was writing this book on the resilient mind, I knew that this was her destiny in her lifes work.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
