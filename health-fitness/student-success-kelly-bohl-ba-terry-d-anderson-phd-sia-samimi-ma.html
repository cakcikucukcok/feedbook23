  <title>Student Success - Kelly Bohl, Ba, Terry D. Anderson, PhD, Sia Samimi, Ma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Student success validates what we teachers do. Yet not all students succeed.
Many give up helplessly, reachingunnecessarilythe end of their ropes. We teachers spent years honing our craft, figuring out ways to reach out, to connect, and to positively affect the lives of our students, not only while in college, but well beyond the often-treacherous college years. Paving the students path toward a thriving university life and a rewarding career, therefore, gives meaning to what we do for a living.
The art of learning has indeed transformed. Both the Internet and distinct generational preferences of our students have introduced new paradigms in post secondary education. Whereas years ago, the teacher and the local university library were the main repositories of knowledge, todays students can use the Internetindeed the libraries of the entire planetto instantly locate the information they need, often effortlessly from the comfort of a couch! What the students want is not mere information; they needand demandpractical knowledge and how information is applied. To be a successful teacher, one must constantly experiment with new and more effective learning strategies that combine best practices in learning.
In this book, the authors have assembled numerous strategies and techniques for academic success. We have emptied our bags of tricks onto these pages. We have witnessed how these strategies rejuvenate our students university experience. By authoring this book, we pass on to youour studentthe intricacies of the art of learning. From the role of motivation to memory retention to the ins and outs of connecting with your teachers, we have provided not only what is needed to succeed academically but also the evidence for our recommendations. We offer you this book not only for us to make sense of our professional lives but also for you to make sense of yours." />
