  <title>Self-Disengagement - Ashbel Vudzijena</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ignore your problem. Ignore it well enough and it will go away.
Miracles start to happen in our lives when we, consciously or unconsciously, step down or surrender the burden to a higher power. We must come to the point of acknowledging that we conquer when we paradoxically appear helpless. The concept of disengagement is the natural equivalent of this Bible verse: He must increase, but I must decrease. (John 3:30). Remember the Bible also says For when I am weak, then I am strong. (2 Corinthians 12:10) and and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.. (Galatians 2:20).
You can choose an easier way to solve your problems, improve your memory, achieve your desires and excel in your assignments. It is simple but very effective. This book helps you explore the disengagement method to problem-solving.
During self-disengagement you become unconscious of your problem and as you do so a miracle happens. This method was discovered through a realization that most successes reach their climax as surprises, implying that we are never fully aware of the processes that generate success in our lives. I have come to realize that success is unconscious. You are never exactly sure of the destiny of your life. Have you ever realized that most fulfilling surprises come to you once you stop chasing after them?
We sometimes stand in the way of our own miracles. As soon as we disengage something desirable starts happening. A wound that is ignored heals faster and is more manageable than the one that receives constant attention
Its all about disengagement. Read this book and improve your grades through Disengagement." />
