  <title>The Wow Factor in the Worlds of Work - Paula Stenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paula Stenberg is a creative careers strategist, workshop facilitator and small business mentor. She operates a careers lounge and facilitates professional development programmes through small group workshops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the material in this book is derived from her Personal Branding and Identity Development workshop where numerous clients have benefited from the exercises about themselves, who have then moved forward and upward in their careers expressing their WOW factor!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WOW factor is that all evasive X-factor that some of us easily exude while others dont think they have any of IT at all! Paula believes everyone has an element of the X-factor, but it just needs discovering, harnessing and releasing. In this workbook she shows you how and directs the discovery of yours, particularly in relation to your world(s) of work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workbook is sub-titled coloring in your nebula. Paula uses this as a metaphor, she explains: Our brains have their own nebulae (thats our grey matter) and our galaxies do too! (thats the iridescent gases). The nebulae are the star nurseries where stars are born. Our minds are like that, nurseries for ideas to be born, birthing sparks of inspiration. As the universe is infinite, so are our minds. Paula believes in figuratively coloring in our grey nebula to iridescent. Add light and you have instant color, add a little color and everything comes to life. Light up yourselves and become a star is not just what the famous have done; you too can shine like stars in the heavens, that hold us in awe of their splendour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paula encourages coloring in your nebula by starting at your identity development and then personal brand, so you can gain that awe  the wonder of you, your X-factor back into that someone  who is AWESOME!&lt;/p&gt;" />
