  <title>ReThink Selling - Brandin Wilkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t have to be in sales to get the most out of this book. If you&amp;#39;re&amp;nbsp;feeling lost, trapped, stuck, average but you know you have more in you, then this will serve as an evergreen &amp;quot;how to&amp;quot; guide to get you playing at a Rockstar level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hated, well strongly disliked, salespeople.&amp;nbsp; Sleezy, greasy, slimy, and dishonest were words that came to mind with the profession.&amp;nbsp; It wasn&amp;#39;t until I accidentally stumbled into the automotive industry that I changed my perception. In 6 years I went from Sales to Ownership with no experience, connections in the industry, no cell phone for the first year and a half, and I still don&amp;#39;t have a Facebook account.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What separated me from others? I ignored the majority of traditional sales strategies and shifted my focus to developing myself, my brand, and my business. This has led me to own 3 companies, being recognized as one of the top Automotive Professionals in North America, and to writing this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my hope that you lean on ReThink Selling as a constant resource for yourself and share it with those you know would find value in it as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
