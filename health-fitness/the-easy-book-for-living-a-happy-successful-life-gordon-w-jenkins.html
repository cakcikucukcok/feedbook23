  <title>The Easy Book for Living a Happy, Successful Life - Gordon W. Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gordon Jenkins was born on December 27, 1945 in small rural community of Rigby, Idaho.   The first 18 years of his life, his family lived on a acre farm a few miles West of Rigby.  He stated his first recollection living in a small house, his mother cooking on a wood stove and watching his father harness the horses to go out into the field to work the farm with crops of alfalfa, grain and potatoes.  Later the farm became more of a dairy farm.  He learned to love milk and hate milking cows-especially in minus 20-degree weather. This was all before television, computers and any modern appliances.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Gordon attended public schools in that same area.  After graduating from High School, the next two years were spent in Austria and Southern Germany as a full-time missionary.  After returning home, he attended Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah and received a Bachelor Degree in Accounting.   Later, he attended Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, California and obtained a Juris Doctorate Degree.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upon graduating from law school, Gordon and his wife, Jolene, returned to Idaho Falls, Idaho where they have lived up to the present time and where Gordon  practiced law and participated in various entrepreneurial-related projects.  IGordon and Jolene have also spent a lot of time enjoying the beautiful area of Island Park, Idaho, near Yellowstone Park. They have three adult daughters, some son-in-laws and grandchildren.  Gordon and Jolene are very close with their family and have worked hard to maintain a close family relationship. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In Gordons later years (mid-50s), there were personal struggles and events that brought trials, difficulties and circumstances that needed to be dealt with.  Gordon decided to face the trials outright and publicly, and by doing so, he gained a great deal of prospective on life in general - including what it takes to deal with trials head-on and conquer them.  The trials and experiences he went through gave him many of the insights that made the writing of this book possible." />
