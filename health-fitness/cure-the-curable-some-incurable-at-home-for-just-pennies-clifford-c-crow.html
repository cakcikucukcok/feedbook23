  <title>Cure the Curable &amp; Some Incurable, at Home - for Just Pennies - Clifford C. Crow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On December 5, 2015, Clifford C. Crow became a 78-year-old (youngster), with a background in sales, sales management, and corporate management. He is not a doctor, trainer, or nutritionist, and does not claim to be any of the three. He has, however, been obsessed with studying health problems, weight control, general well-being, and related subjects (including new methods of curing) since the early 1980s. &lt;br&gt;Do you know anyone who is having problems with headaches (including migraines), macular degeneration, cracked heals, emphysema, COPD, lower back pain, eczema, tendinitis, eyesight, etc.? &lt;br&gt;Do you know anyone who wants to quit smoking? This method for quitting was new to the author. After trying many times, this unique method helped him to quit his 4+ packs per day habit at age 47, in just about a week. A real plus of using this method is that even the desire to smoke and the craving for a cigarette is completely gone after this one week. There are also many ways to attack weight problems. This book may contain the help you need for these situations, and a couple hundred more.   &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Clifford C.
