  <title>Losing the Will to Live, Why? - Arnie Burzynski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The main objective in this book is to help others in the world to cope with some, or as much death, as I have endured in my lifetime so far. My grieving seems to last forever. Maybe it will last a lifetime, I don&#39;t know.
This book is about losses in life. It is about suffering, major depression, anger, forgiveness, resentments, misery, loneliness, agony, and suicidal thoughts; but most of all, fighting the devil himself.
This book will not be friendly to the human mind, but it is reality and filled with the feelings and pain I have endured. It is about suffering with a drinking problem and, what I have done this past year to get on track and pick up the broken pieces and, put my life back together again." />
