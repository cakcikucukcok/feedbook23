  <title>Better Single Than Sorry - Jen Schefft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s be honest. No woman &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants to be alone for the rest of her life. But does being alone mean you&#39;re doomed to be miserable forever? Definitely not! And does being single have to equal lonely? No way! You can have the best time of your life when you&#39;re single, but you wouldn&#39;t know that from our relationship obsessed society, where celebrity magazines devote the majority of their content to who&#39;s dating whom and the wedding industry is a $100-billion business. Yet more than a third of marriages end in divorce, and countless other couples languish in unions that shouldn&#39;t have happened in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t become a statistic&amp;#8212;love yourself and never settle!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jen Schefft knows that better than almost anyone. In 2003, she got engaged in front of millions of people on television&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor&lt;/em&gt;, only to see it end nine months later when the relationship just wasn&#39;t right anymore. A year later, she turned down an engagement on &lt;em&gt;The Bachelorette&lt;/em&gt;, and the backlash was relentless. She was labeled a &quot;spinster&quot; by a celebrity magazine, and a noted national talk-show host remarked that she would be &quot;a bachelorette for the rest of her life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a terrible message to send to the millions of sensational single women out there, and in &lt;em&gt;Better Single Than Sorry&lt;/em&gt; Schefft makes it her mission to let women know that it&#39;s better to be single than to be in a relationship that doesn&#39;t make you happy. With testimonials from women of all ages&amp;#8212;single, married, in committed relationships, with children (even single moms) and without&amp;#8212;this book tells you how to let go of your fear of being alone and how to love yourself and never settle for a relationship that is anything less than you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in a conversational style, as if talking with your best friend, Schefft helps you navigate the pressures of a culture that places an unhealthy importance on being in a relationship and shows you how to find happiness in work, home, and the simple pleasures of everyday life. Above all, she shows you how it&#39;s far, far better to be single than sorry. Being single is a time to have fun, learn new things, grow, and blossom&amp;#8212;not a time to feel desperate or depressed, so cherish it!&lt;/p&gt;" />
