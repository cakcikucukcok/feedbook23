  <title>The Essentiality of Educational Leadership in Humanity and Its Relationship with Business. - Jonathan A. Marcellus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leadership has dissimilar characteristics. They are emergent, charismatic, visionary, situational, educational, political and more. I will focus on the educational aspect of leadership to cover many sectors that are impacted by it. Because educational leadership is a very important component in this society today, facts contributing to the power of educational leadership will be addressed based on many academic experts works or researchers findings. Those facts will indicate how educational leadership has influenced business organizations and educational institutions, its relationships with them, and how those organizations have benefited from it. For centuries education has been very appealing to our society. Henceforth, I will employ many experts works to show the importance of educational leadership, the quantity and the quality of difference it has brought into individuals mostly children or students as well as business organizations." />
