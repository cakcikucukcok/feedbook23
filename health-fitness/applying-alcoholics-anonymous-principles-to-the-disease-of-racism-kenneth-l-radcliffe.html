  <title>Applying Alcoholics Anonymous Principles to the Disease of Racism - Kenneth L. Radcliffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book will be threefold. First, it will seek to demonstrate that racism is a disease, a mental illness. Its symptoms are similar to those of the disease of alcoholism. Second, that racism like alcoholism has not been proven curable at this point in time. However, like alcoholism, it is treatable. The symptoms can be arrested! A treatment plan for the victims of racism, primarily African Americans and other peoples of color living on the North American Continent will be suggested and why. Because the lives of these victims of racism, like the lives of those affected by the behavior of the alcoholic in most instances, are dysfunctional. Finally the origin and role of the Black Churchs resistance to racism in America will be described briefly." />
