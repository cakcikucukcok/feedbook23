  <title>Atheist to Zen - Greg Kesler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine experiencing continuous, peaceful living. Everyone has the inherent capacity to remain in a state of joy and serenity, regardless of circumstances. Peace resides at the core of all creation, it can never be uprooted, only covered up. This is an inspirational story of transformation from suffering to healing, followed by five methods you can use to bring joy into your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Kesler lived most of his life as an atheist, dwelling in the paralyzing fear of uncertainty. Afraid of living and afraid of dying, the only thing he believed in was struggling and forcing his way through life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2011, Greg and two of his children nearly drowned in a river during a float tubing mishap. Being a non-believer in any higher power, the visitation from a loving, intelligent Presence under the water with them, came as quite a shock. This life-changing event, combined with another Spiritual encounter a year prior, radically shifted Gregs views of himself, other people, and the world around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hes studying to be a Spiritual guidance counselor to assist people in learning about their Divine nature, perfect in every way. His new purpose in life is to help others free themselves, as he has been freed, by the grace of Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlimited joy is always available, for its the natural state of all of creation. This book guides you in how to bring instant and sustainable peace into your life, starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is beautiful! Enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
