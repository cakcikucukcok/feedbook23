  <title>Lighten Up: Diets Don&#39;t Work YOU Do - linda maritn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Lighten Up&quot; is more than a diet book filled with with recipes, counting calories and carbohydrates. The book is about recovering from food addiction, resolving food issues and living from a higher level of consciousness.  Ultimately, it is learning to experience a life full of everyday miracles and expressing one&#39;s talents and gifts. Living a life of darkness for over nineteen years and free from food issues for over thirty seven years, I am dedicated to educate, inspire, and help improve the quality of people&#39;s lives, healing from the past, revolving around food issues, forever.  Information about my book:  After getting the food in order without dieting, bringing balance and nutrition into the body, we delve deeper into what is eating us. Food is not the problem. There are four parts in the book: physical, mental, emotional and spiritual and how the obsession of food can overtake our health on all levels.  Included are many techniques and tools to assist one to move from a place of pain to freedom and peace. Included are three additional authors: experts in the field of Imago Therapy, Sexual Abuse and Emotional Freedom Technique to add to the healing process, all powerful healing modalities.  The Spiritual Part is the most profound which includes spiritual practices enabling one to begin to awaken the giant within.  In &quot;Lighten Up&quot;, one begins to discover Life is not from the outside in, it is from the inside out. The answers are within and there is where our power lives. Readers will begin to experience a greater sense of themselves. Diets will be a thing of the past, eating what you want  and when you want without guilt and shame, will be part of the new YOU...Diets Don&#39;t Work YOU Do. &quot;Lighten Up&quot; is unique, a one of a kind book and there is no other book available that has the information I offer." />
