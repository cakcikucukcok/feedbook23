  <title>Study Hacks: Study Hacks For Better Grades - Miguel M. Macieira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many books and articles were written to explain the simplest and most effective ways to study. The fact that many resources were already spent in this process, shows that studying can be hard work. However, it doesn’t need to be.&lt;br/&gt;
Despite the available methods nowadays not being useful for everyone, it is always possible to count with a trial and error method to identify ways that ease our journey towards knowledge and learning.&lt;br/&gt;
The methods presented here don´t substitute the effort needed to achieve higher grades and be approved in tests and contests, but each useful idea available to achieve those goals is welcome since the process of learning is frequently tiresome.&lt;br/&gt;
In this book, we compiled in the first part the basic orientations for students to develop better and faster in the tasks they perform; and, in the second part, we bring specific hints, such as tips to put in practice “emergency plans” for exams.&lt;br/&gt;
May the reader choose which method he sees fit, put in practice the hints and see which ones work for you.&lt;br/&gt;" />
