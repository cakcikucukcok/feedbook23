  <title>Francis, Not the Saint: A True Story - Floriana Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Francis, Not the Saint&lt;/i&gt; is a true story of a family&#39;s triumph over adversity during The Great Depression and World War II.

It is a story of a man who tried to juggle three families at the same time and found out that it cannot be done. A man who lied and cheated and made his children victims of his lies. It is also a spiritual story of a daughter&#39;s forgiveness of the lies he told, which is a criteria for complete and peaceful existence.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Floriana Hall, b. 10/2/27, Pittsburgh, PA, graduate and Distinguished Alumna of Cuyahoga Falls High School, Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, attended Akron University, married Robert Hall 63 years, five children, nine grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, author/editor of sixteen non-fiction inspirational books, SMALL CHANGE, self published; THE ADVENTURES OF FLOSSIE, ROBBIE, AND JUNEY During The Great Depression (2006), THE SANDS OF RHYME, self published, DADDY WAS A BAD BOY, OUT OF THE ORDINARY SHORT STORIES, HEARTS ON THE MEND (2006), FRANCIS, NOT THE SAINT in English and Spanish,  MISS FLOSSIE&#39;S WORLD - Coping with Adversity During The Great Depression Then and The Recession Now, SHORT STORIES OF ANGELS, HOPE, AND LAUGHTER. &lt;br&gt;Founder/coordinator of the Poet&#39;s Nook at Cuyahoga Falls Library, Editor of The Poet&#39;s Nook&#39;s five books, THROUGH OUR EYES, POEMS OF BEAUTIFUL NORTHEAST OHIO, POET&#39;S NOOK POTPOURRI, and TOUCHING THE HEARTS OF GENERATIONS and POEMS OF BEAUTIFUL OHIO, Then and Now.
