  <title>My Life in a Nutshell - Hans Strichow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;If you are interested in who we are as an individual, what we are doing on this planet, and where we are going as a human race, then you will be interested in the person who gave us the answers in his book entitled Our Ultimate Purpose in Life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;My Life in a Nutshell is a brief summary of his life and the fun and frustrations that eventually led to his writing the book as an expression of his fulfi lment need and desire to contribute to the future of mankind. His journey began in 1941 in Germany, where he still managed to have a lot of fun, despite the war and the general shortage of food and housing, which he remembers with a sense of humour reflecting his optimism about life in general.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He continues his journey in Australia, where he arrived in 1960 together with his family who were intent on becoming citizens in a country full of opportunities, which they applied themselves to with the best of their ability.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the same time, there was a sense of exploitation by the rich and powerful, which led to many a frustration as the author expected a fair return for a fair days work, which he eventually addressed with a TOP Management Manual.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, the management system was not yet ready for his vision of the future, which eventually led to his commitment to the research and development of a connection between a Grand Order of Design and The Human Condition.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;His journey is one which we can all identify with, regardless of our position in life; after all, to be human is all about: Fun, Frustrations and Fulfi lment&lt;/P&gt;" />
