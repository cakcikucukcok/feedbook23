  <title>Pain with a Purpose - Dr. Cheryl R. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pain With a Purpose takes a look at what pain is, what it does, and how it effects our lives.  Often times as believers we are made to feel like we should not have to endure any pain, but not true.  The more anointed you are, the more you will be tried.  The more gifted you are, the more you will be tested. This book brings a sense of reality to your pain in order to find meaning.  Part of understanding your pain is acknowledging it and accepting the process that comes with it. This book is intended to highlight that. Often times your perspective of pain can hinder you from seeing the bigger picture-- that there is a purpose in this somewhere. The process is intended to help someone else.  There will always be challenges in life.  How you face those challenges sets the tone for how you maneuver through life. This book is written specifically to anyone who has ever experienced pain and did not understand why or was not sure of how to move forward.  Understanding the process can help you move from hurting to healing to wholeness.  This book is written to offer insight.  This is written to offer hope." />
