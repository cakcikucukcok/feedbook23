  <title>A Lost World - Ernest M. Roberts.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book reviews the causes of illness and offers solutions toward providing good health care in an effective and affordable way. This book suggests an alternative model of medical education and practice, detailing a medical system that is inexpensive and effective based on the combination of present medical treatment and alternative medicine together, providing a genuinely individual approach to each patient. Within my book, there is a critique of popular, erroneous ideas about what are healthy foods and drinks, including the myth of low-fat foods and semiskimmed milk and the issue of obesity. It also discusses the National Health Service and its inevitable collapse, according to economic laws. The medical treatment now widely offered does not produce good health but rather the reverse. Evidence of this is given with a researched critique of the present drug-industry-led medical treatment, including facts on the withdrawal of unsafe drugs and the failure of regulation." />
