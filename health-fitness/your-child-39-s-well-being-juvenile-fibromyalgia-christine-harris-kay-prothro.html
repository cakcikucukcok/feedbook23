  <title>Your Child&#39;s Well-Being - Juvenile Fibromyalgia - Christine Harris, Kay Prothro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Your Child&#39;s Well-Being - Juvenile Fibromyalgia is a practical and uplifting resource guide for all parents and family members of children and teenagers who may be living with Fibromyalgia. Full of up-to-date information and guidance, this book will help you to successfully navigate the Fibromyalgia terrain.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;P&gt;ENDORSEMENTS FOR &quot;Your Child&#39;s Well-Being - Juvenile Fibromyalgia&#39;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;This book is a &quot;must-read&#39; for any parent of a child with widespread pain. We now know that a cluster of symptoms, such as pain, fatigue, mental fogginess, difficulty sleeping, anxiety, and depression, in any combination, are part of the fibromyalgia like syndrome. This book is easy to read and provides some important guides on how parents can help their child. I give it a strong recommendation!&quot;&lt;/P&gt;

Director, Pediatric Pain and Palliative Care Program&lt;br /&gt;
Distinguished Professor of Pediatrics, Anesthesiology, Psychiatry and&lt;br /&gt; Biobehavioral Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA &lt;i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;Having a child diagnosed with Juvenile Fibromyalgia sometimes can be a long and confusing journey and this book is a truly empathic guide that should give parents and caregivers a sense of empowerment and hope. Most importantly, the authors have put together an easy-to-read book which offers practical support and resources for parents to get the best care for their child and assist their child to achieve a well-balanced life despite their symptoms. I would recommend it as a must-read for parents of teens with JFM.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&quot;This is a great resource you&#39;ve put together - well done! And thank you for including EFT/tapping as a tool that folks can use to help relieve both the physical and emotional discomfort faced by the children and the people who love them.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
