  <title>Ministry: the Delicate Flower - Vernike Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ministry is very important. God, and we as believers take it very seriously. There are all sorts of ministries.
Lets define ministry, itself- (Webster) : 1. The office or function of a clergyman or minister of state. 2. The clergy, or the ministers of state collectively. 3. {brit.} an administrative department of the government.
I have come up with a defi nition of my own. I know you just cant wait to hear it! Here goes: Meeting the needs of the people, raising their morale, purpose, and confi dence, and fi nally pointing them to Jesus Christ. I knew youd like it!
There is life ministry-just living a life of example to provoke and challenge others (the ungodly) to change their manner of life and denounce Satan and the carnal man and become born again! You can even characterize ministries according to what particular audiences are captured by them. For example, Youth ministry, Outreach, Evangelical, Preaching, Helps, etc. For your reading pleasure and spiritual edifi cation I want to ponder some primary points; discuss these with others.
Is Gods plan working through your perspective ministry?
Is ministry tops in your walk with God?" />
