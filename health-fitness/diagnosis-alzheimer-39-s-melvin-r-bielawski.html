  <title>Diagnosis: Alzheimer&#39;s - Melvin R. Bielawski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; LINE-HEIGHT: 24pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;This is the story of two people, Melvin and Frances, who met while young, fell in love, and married. They raised three sons, enjoyed a loving, warm, and close family life. They traveled extensively in Europe, Canada, and the United States. They were blessed with good health and suffered only minor aches and pains during their middle and early senior years. However, Frances began to have memory problems almost concurrent with turning 80 years of age. An early diagnosis by the family physician and a neurologist identified the symptoms as minor cognitive impairment (MCI). In subsequent years the diagnosis was changed to Alzheimers disease. This is the story of the impact on Frances, Melvin, and the immediate family in dealing with this incurable disease.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
