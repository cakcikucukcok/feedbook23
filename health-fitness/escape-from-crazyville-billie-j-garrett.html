  <title>Escape from Crazyville - Billie J. Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Escape From Crazyville is a book
designed to help women trapped in
abusive toxic love relationships to
safely navigate their way to refuge. In
order to escape Crazyville, one has to
adopt a strategic military mindset. You
have to be more seriously determined
and committed to your freedom than
youve ever been concerning any
venture of your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to select and involve the people that you whole heartedly trust. It has to be
a coordinated eff ort. And even an eff ort wont do. You have to work on your plan to
make it fool proof. Th ere are appropriate agencies and support entities in which you
can avail yourself to the necessary services, who are waiting to assist you with your
escape plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can not just decide one day out of the blue that your fed-up, youve had enough
and you are simply not going to take it anymore. Getting mad on the spur, packing
a few bags announcing,  Im done, Im out, is by no means a realistic escape plan.
Doing so can quite possibly eff ect a death sentence on you and your loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be sensible. You did not get into this relationship over night. You will have to
strategically plan your work and eff ectively work your escape plan to get free. Th is
book is designed to help you successfully chart and navigate that course. It is not
a long read. Th erefore study it carefully and read it as many times as need be to
establish your great worth in this life and your rights and plans towards Manifest
Destiny... Youll be glad you did!&lt;/p&gt;" />
