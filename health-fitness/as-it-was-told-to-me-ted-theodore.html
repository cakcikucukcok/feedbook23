  <title>As It Was Told to Me - Ted Theodore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Holy Bible contains God and his promises to every believer. Through the Holy
Spirit, by divine revelations, we get to know and understand God words to us. Author Ted
Theodore shares wisdom and divine insight about Gods word to every reader, especially
devout Christians, in his book, As It Was Told To Me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When God promises, rather when God speaks, His Word is certain. It is definite.
It is truth. It is life. When Jesus said, The words that I speak are spirit and life, He was
referring to the spiritual creation of the Word and the eventual physical manifestation. It
is this certainty that makes the concordance meaning of the word promise, in the New
Testament, come alive, the author stated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In As It Was Told To Me, Theodore offers a deeper understanding of the scriptures
found in the books of the Holy Bible. He captures truths that help readers understand
about God, his absolute power, eternal presence, the value of faith, the lessons found in
the Book of Genesis, the importance of prayer, and inspires readers to re-examine their
beliefs, and their spiritual journey. This book will open readers eyes to the truth of Gods
words  providing a deeper and greater understanding of the Bible, which will eventually
help them to in their spiritually growth and walk with God." />
