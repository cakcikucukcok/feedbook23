  <title>The Paths We Walk    Trails - Felicia Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in Fairhope, Alabama, and the beach resort area of Scenic Highway 30A in Floridas panhandle, four thirty-something ladies support each other through the triumphs and hard decisions of life. When their own ladies retreat is canceled by the sudden illness of its veteran coordinator, Deli, Jess, Anne, and Lindsay travel to Seaside, Florida, for a local churchs meeting on biblical reflection and meditation. The verses they study bring unexpected insights into their relationships with God, their families, and even themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single ladies, Deli and Jess, gain greater insight into what it means to be a part of a godly relationship. Deli battles her abuse history and takes a step of faith toward a future she never imagined could be hers. Jess, on the other hand, struggles to come to terms with her failing three-year relationship with a man who has little interest in God and faith. Meanwhile, Anne and Lindsay confront issues of motherhood. Annes pre-teen daughter has begun a slow descent into silence and moodiness leading Anne to question her long-held beliefs about parenting. Lindsay has her own questions, but with two young daughters now both school-aged, hers is a battle of mothers guilt against a possible return to her first love: a career in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their questions are our questions. Their journeys are our journeys. Come join them as they discover their own answers and Gods plan for their lives on The Paths We Walk.&lt;/p&gt;" />
