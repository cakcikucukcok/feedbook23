  <title>Stop Making Yourself Miserable - Rachel  Aldrich Rader</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I know what I have to do, I just have to do it.&amp;rdquo; How many times have you said this to yourself in regards to your diet or exercise routine? You&amp;rsquo;re not alone. As women, we&amp;rsquo;ve been conditioned to believe that this is something that should be important to us. But most women spend their lives on a quest for that perfect plan only to get stuck in a cycle of failure and guilt. Rachel Aldrich Rader was one of these women for most of her life even as she was working as a personal trainer and trying to set an example for others!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Stop Making Yourself Miserable, Rachel draws on her own personal and professional experience to show why this all or nothing line of thinking does not create the results you&amp;rsquo;re looking for &amp;ndash; despite what the fitness industry would have you believe. Instead, she dissects the thought processes and beneath-the-surface beliefs that hold women back and gives practical, simple advice to empower you to create the healthy lifestyle you&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted. No guilt, no perfectionism, no gross green smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
