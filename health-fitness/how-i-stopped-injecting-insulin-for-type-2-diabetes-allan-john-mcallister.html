  <title>HOW I STOPPED INJECTING INSULIN FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES - Allan John McAllister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;/Cmd+V&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you a type TWO diabetic injecting insulin daily . If you are like I was it was something that I hated , the thought of that needle played with my head . So after years of uncontrollable weight , still having trouble with high readings along with the occasional hypo , I decided to change my life for the better , and it was mainly about the food that I was eating , so I made myself a health drink along with the right food . I have lost 28 kilos and now control my sugar with tablets only along with good food .I never felt better ......plus NO MORE NEEDLES these days I only take a few tablets to control my sugar HOW GOOD IS THAT . I always hated needles and at one stage I gained 20 kg which took me up to 120 kg . I now weigh 92kg which I hope to get down to 85kg very soon .. these days I am busy all the time , I do not have time to lay about , I am 71 years old and feel 31 . this is the best that I have felt for forty years , I feel great and I am looking forward to my 110 th birthday .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This drink will boost your immune system and by replacing your morning coffee and maybe a little breakfast with a glass of this drink will start your day healthy , but like most things it will not work in one day , it needs to be ongoing ,one day you will wake up and just wonder why you feel so great , believe me you will be happy and healthier , just add a little exercise and the right food , it is easier than you think ..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
