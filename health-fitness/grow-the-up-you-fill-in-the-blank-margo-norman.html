  <title>Grow the ------ Up! You Fill in the Blank! - Margo Norman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Self-Perpetuated Drama Syndrome is the unnecessary, self-inflicted, daily stress that seems to happen in your life. SPDS affects a lot of women, no matter their age, race, religion, financial status, or geographical backgrounds. The need to have drama seems to be a gender-specific issue, yet SPDS has negative effects on both genders. Women (more than men) tend to inflict their SPDS on others without realizing that they have a problem in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are older, wiser, more mature women in the world who have found the trick to living a DRAMA-FREE life. Ms. Norman views herself as one of these women, and has written this guide to help you first identify if you have SPDS, and secondly, show you how to conquer it. Ms. Norman, a self-proclaimed people-ologist, has been able to draw from her own experiences with SPDS and give valuable advice on how to cure it, by teaching you the symptoms, giving clear examples of situations in her own life with SPDS that may be familiar to you, and then showing you how to alleviate the drama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have at least one argument daily? See Chapter 1-Grow The-----Up! Do you still live at home with your parents, but cant stop arguing with them? Chapter 5- Youre Grown So Buy Your Own! teaches you how to appreciate your situation and bring peace to a potentially drama-filled experience. Ms. Norman interviewed hundreds of people who identified with having SPDS. She came up with ten common issues concerning daily, self-inflicted stress that seem to be the cause of the drama women suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her humorously candid portrayal of her own SPDS will cause you to think about why SPDS is considered the norm in todays society, like lying about your age (chapter 1) and in-appropriate behavior associated with your fashion choices (chapter 2-What The -----Are You Wearing). Ms. Norman also speaks about two topics that are considered taboo- Chapter 9-Youre A Women So You Cant be The Daddy deals with lesbians and the effects of gender identity issues on children and Chapter 10-What He Really Thinks addresses the effects of SPDS on men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SPDS is a very real ailment and there are easy, drama-free solutions to cure it. Ms. Norman hopes to shed light on this subject and give a much needed view on the silent killer of peaceful living! Her advice is for women to Grow The ----- UP!&lt;/p&gt;" />
