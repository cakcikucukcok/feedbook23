  <title>Uncovering the I Am - Nan W. Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="an honest look at the energies  I had allowed to run me most of my life. When I awoke to the simple, astounding Truth of the built-in innocence in free will and individual sovereignty, I chose to be a master at Love, not fear. 
Anyone can change. We are responsible for our own choices.
 Nan opens her mind and heart in a way that at times, is startling, yet is deeply refreshing. Read, Uncovering the I AM, and prepare to change. You will be invited and challenged to get real with yourself, forgive yourself, and ultimately to love yourself unconditionally. 
John Mark Stroud, Founder: One Who Wakes, www.onewhowakes.org 
 Nan captivates us, transparently sharing her metamorphosis from dark, angry confusion to joyful innocence of the child within. We too can loosen our grip on patterns of self-judgment and misperceptions of ourselves and others. We can change a sense of personal unworthiness into a light-filled delight of self. 
Myra Partyka, Reiki Master Teacher, www.reikiworksri.com 
 We learn from those who have sincerely made the trek from fear to love. Nan found a way to turn her mind back upon itself and look curiously at her life until the deepest reasons for events unmasked themselves in revelation and even mystical awakening. 
 Journey with Nan and breathe deeply, so the flavor of her often humorous sharings may suffuse every cell. Growing in awareness of Loves Reality is a sojourn that requires care, patience, and just a smidgen of our willingness.
