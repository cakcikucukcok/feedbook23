  <title>From the Kitchen of New Hope Church - Dr. Betty Glover Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about healthy eating. I have been an anesthesia provider in the health care industry for 36 years, and have seen many patients with various health conditions caused by faulty diet habits. Realizing that most people continue to eat the same way they were reared , unless someone provides a easy way for the first steps of healthy eating. 
It is my intent that this publication will help someone become more aware of their bodies and treat them like the sacred vessel they are.
I enjoy giving seminars on better living to help inform others about our magnificent body and how to keep it. I also enjoy giving cooking demonstrations and concluding with a tasting party. Many people are so surprised at how tasty food really is." />
