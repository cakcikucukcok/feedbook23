And for years, she ignored her doctor&amp;#8217;s advice to lose weight and get healthy before she developed full blown diabetes. When she finally got the big-D diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, the same disease that took her mother&amp;#8217;s life, Sherri vowed that she&amp;#8217;d change her ways so that her son wouldn&amp;#8217;t be left alone, without a mother, as she had been.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of her doctor, she created this program, lost more than 40 pounds, and she looks great and has more energy than she did in her twenties. Sherri&amp;#8217;s diabetes is under control, and she was happy to show her stuff, wowing the world on &lt;em&gt;Dancing with the Stars&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;br /&gt;With tools to help you live a long and healthy life,&lt;em&gt; Plan D&lt;/em&gt; is a smart and supportive plan designed to help you lose weight safely, make exercise a real, and fun, part of your life, and control your sugar sensitivity. And through it all, Sherri Shepherd is there, like a trusted friend, offering advice, encouragement, and of course a healthy dose of humor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
