  <title>The Little Book of Hygge - Meik Wiking</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace Hygge (pronounced hoo-ga) and become happier with this definitive guide to the Danish philosophy of comfort, togetherness, and well-being.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are Danes the happiest people in the world? The answer, says Meik Wiking, CEO of the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, is Hygge. Loosely translated, Hygge—pronounced Hoo-ga—is a sense of comfort, togetherness, and well-being. &quot;Hygge is about an atmosphere and an experience,&quot; Wiking explains. &quot;It is about being with the people we love. A feeling of home. A feeling that we are safe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hygge is the sensation you get when you’re cuddled up on a sofa, in cozy socks under a soft throw, during a storm. It’s that feeling when you’re sharing comfort food and easy conversation with loved ones at a candlelit table. It is the warmth of morning light shining just right on a crisp blue-sky day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Little Book of Hygge&lt;/em&gt; introduces you to this cornerstone of Danish life, and offers advice and ideas on incorporating it into your own life, such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get comfy. Take a break.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be here now. Turn off the phones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn down the lights. Bring out the candles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build relationships. Spend time with your tribe.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give yourself a break from the demands of healthy living. Cake is most definitely Hygge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Live life today, like there is no coffee tomorrow.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From picking the right lighting to organizing a Hygge get-together to dressing hygge, Wiking shows you how to experience more joy and contentment the Danish way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
