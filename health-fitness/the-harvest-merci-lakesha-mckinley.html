      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Little did Merci know the Bible she&amp;#39;d received as a gift from her mother when she was nine years old would sustain her through most of her trials and tribulations as a domestic violence survivor and sexual assault survivor. In The Harvest, Merci teaches Christian women a simple but profound method to turn their tragedies into triumphs. As a born again Christian, Merci found an uncompromising faith in the word of God. The Harvest is a powerful Christian Devotional that guides women through a step-by-step process of uncovering the layers of their pain with the love of God, Bible scripture and prayer. Women will find their lives transformed by faith and inspired by love in this true story of female empowerment and overcoming adversity. The Harvest, just as Merci&amp;#39;s Bible, is a gift to bless others as well as yourself. Let Merci help you develop unshakable Christian faith while showing how to love yourself as God loves you, how to receive the Heaven God has for you on earth. It&amp;#39;s a golden field of love and redemption that produces an ever growing, ever precious crop of peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
