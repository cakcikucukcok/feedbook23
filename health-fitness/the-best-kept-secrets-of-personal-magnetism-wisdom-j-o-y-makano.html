  <title>The Best Kept Secrets of Personal Magnetism - Wisdom J.O.Y. Makano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are all kinds of people out there, the affluent, the tall, the elegant, the beauty queens, etc. . . yet, many times the outer appearance or material possession does not make a significant impact at all on the image we project to the world. While physical appearance or material possession may sometimes be helpful, as many people judge the book by the cover until they read the content, the secret of lasting personal magnetism is totally a different animal. Sadly, money does not buy love is a lesson many learn the hard way. Then, what makes it possible for some people to easily conquer the hearts of their fellow men without necessarily physical or financial advantage? Why do the rich and the famous sometimes lose their life mates or friends to the financially less fortunate people than themselves? Where does the power of charismatic people come from? How do they master the art of keeping people happy while craving more? The author in this book answers these and many other questions with insightful experience based on lifelong research of ancient secrets of personal magnetism. We were not all born wealthy, well connected or as attractive as we would like to be; that is a fact. Hence, understanding the secrets of personal magnetism puts the key of opening any social door in ones hands, regardless of ones social station in life. That is 50% of the battle won in your favor. The other 50% depends on the diligence of the application of the laws herein detailed." />
