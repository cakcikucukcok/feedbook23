  <title>Walking with the Vain Cattle - Amal A. Islim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Upon the secrets of the Caribbean Sea, Amal Islim makes a wish, asking the wish master for happiness and peace. A whisper in her soul makes her understand that she must take the journey towards her higher self. Standing in that crossroads, she meets the Doorkeeper that is separating heaven from the mundane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the doorkeeper holds that doors key, He challenges her to go into her darkness and bring it to light. She takes the challenge, and plunges into the unknown to reach the cruel test of paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yearning for her Golden fields, she realizes, that first, she must face the soul of death. In her own womb, she nests, thinking that she is in her Coffin. Surrendering now to her fate, finally, hears that stillness sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In peace, she awakens and in humble grace, knowing now, that no true victory is without a noble destination. She finally understands that in her perfect faith, and in believing in the incredible, she was able to reach what is called the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she breathes life, and lets the blood flood into her face, that sinner becomes a saint and walks through the gate of the enchanted new Beginning. Proving that when a man is willing and eager, God joins in.&lt;/p&gt;" />
