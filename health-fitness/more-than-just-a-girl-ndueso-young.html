  <title>More Than Just a Girl! - Ndueso Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What The Heck Is It About Being a Girl?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what the true essence of girlhood is? Ever pondered if there is something more to being feminine? Ever found fault with the struggle to fit into a defined role that reduces your lifes purpose down to waiting for some guy to put a ring on your finger? Do you crave for a life of greater objectivity, value, relevance, fulfilment and personal greatness? Girlhood offers that life! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Than Just a Girl! is an undiluted and straight-forward departure from the must-fit-in, wear-little-or-nothing-on-your-body, hook-up-with-any-boy, feel-good and have fun messages everywhere. It is a promising call to the more rewarding use of girlhood for empowering activities that stimulates the power within. In her clearly classic and practical style, Ndueso Young provides invaluable insights that will help you:&lt;br /&gt;
  gain the courage to shred the paradigm of passive existence &lt;br /&gt;
 interpret the events of your life in empowering perspectives &lt;br /&gt;
 identify barriers to personal confidence and steer yourself to interdependence &lt;br /&gt;
 guard yourself from abuse-driven proposals and shine from within &lt;br /&gt;
 live on purpose, reach for lofty heights, and achieve personal greatness &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have in your hands a thought-provoking bundle that will shift your perceptions and stir you into worthwhile actions. Get ready to experience the lost drive for girlhood optimization, and find what will take you from mere feminine gender identity to becoming more than just a girl!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ndueso brings a refreshing insight to girls as she encourages them to see beyond the&lt;br /&gt;
cover of their identity and search deeper into the content of what it means to be a girl.&lt;br /&gt;
