  <title>Haunting Memories - B. W. Van Riper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Oh, no the anguished cry rang out. For a sister and her brothers, it was terrible newsof a death in the familythe death that left them dumbfounded. Broken hearted, here they were, a grand family suddenly bereft of a great part. It made no sense. Sorry to inform you, the awful words struck like a thunderbolt. Mom and dad had crashed on their vacation trip. So unfair, so unreal, so jarringso final.
All the siblings could think of was how much love was lost to them. Their parents were the linchpins; they were the finest; they were the most revered. At a loss due to a loss. So much love and affection was denied them in an unpredictable moment. What was to become of them?
Mom with her daily wisdom. Dad with his usual counsel. Mom with her laugh. Dad with his wry humor. Mom with her catering and caring. Dad with his hugs and counsel. What will they do without them?
The sister and her husband, the brothers and their wives, succumbed to the pain, weakening them. Where would the strength come from that was required to survive such a tragedy?
When ravaged by happenstance, What holds the family together when hope and promise lose some of their dash? In the moments of crisis, inevitably, people are hanging on by hanging tough. That courage comes from their heritage, which is the real force, the saving grace. Its not just what they have inherited in family lore, but the bond that ties endowment and legacy together in a triumvirate that can spark the spirit.
Haunting Memories says something about how desire can influence perception; by allowingor causingus to see what we want to see.
We wonder when theyre gone, Did we do enough for them? Did we express our love and affection often enough? Were we good to them? We arent going to be able to answer yes to all such questions without some reservation. Because were never going to think weve done all that we could have or should have done for our loved ones. 
We cant get our minds off them. We cant let them go. We want them back. But we cant have them back. They are where they are. And we cant get there from here." />
