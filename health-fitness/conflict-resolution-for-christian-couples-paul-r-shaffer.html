  <title>Conflict Resolution for Christian Couples - Paul R. Shaffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Conflict Resolution for Christian Couples is written in a comprehensive, easy-to-understand, and logical progression that maps out how to have a healthy relationship - one where conflict can be readily managed. The book has solid answers and strategies for Christian couples having difficulties working out reasonable solutions.
This book consists of four parts.
Part I is about establishing a spiritually healthy foundation for the relationship: 1) knowing the basics of Biblical knowledge, prayer, fellowship and ministry, and 2) taking into account the spiritual world, and respecting the balance between grace and accountability.
Part II details a useful conflict resolution model and itemizes 26 effective tools (the ABCs)  for moving smoothly through issues.
Part III provides a 3-part solution model for mapping out a plan for change, and discusses healthy routines for maintaining change.
Part IV addresses two unique dilemmas for long-term relationships: 1) affair recovery or affair safe-guarding, and 2) considering or going through a marital separation." />
