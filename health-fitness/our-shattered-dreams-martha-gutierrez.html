  <title>Our Shattered Dreams - Martha Gutierrez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Despite our hurts and disappointments in life, we were created with a purpose. Each scene we lived, regardless of the pain inflicted to our soul; in the end, when all the pieces of the puzzle are put together, we will be able to see the magnificent masterpiece, and then we will be able to understand that there was a reason for every shattered dream. 
Have you wondered if anyone can relate to your pain? This book will help you to discover the beauty among the thorns; will encourage you to continue the fight you are engaged in, and to never give up, because you are making the difference in the midst of your surroundings. There is no victory without a battle. Some abandon their dreams for different reasons. This book will inspire you to be an overcomer, to be the conqueror you were created and equipped to be; even before you realized that you are in a battlefield. You are not alone. There are others like you, who are warriors, and understand that it doesnt matter the many pieces they have to pick up from the floor, and start all over again; they keep fighting for the prize. It doesnt matter how you feel, or how many barriers you have to run over; you are not alone. Your descendants are your fans and witnesses. One day they will reap the fruit of your efforts. 
While the breath of life is still in us; there is hope, and the sky is the limit! 
Every hurt and every disappointment is a stepping-stone to your final destination. You are not alone. Dont give up!" />
