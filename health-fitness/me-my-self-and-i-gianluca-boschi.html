FIVE STEPS TO BECOMING YOUR real Self:
 THE UNTOLD STORY 
(Mind &amp; Body)
Most of us want to understand more about ourselves and who we are in everyday life. The reality in which we live may resemble somebody elses life and dreams (our First Program), causing us to repeat patterns of our parents and family members, this happens at the cellular level (behavioural cells) and is recorded in the same way as DNA. Through our senses, we are creating an internal picture (the movie of our life) and like a movie it will follow a script which shapes and influences our beliefs and values in all our choices. 
This book is a five-step Self-realization kit to create a new script in Light of our new choices and evolution, taking us on the road to becoming our real Self! We can reprogram ourselves with repetition in the same way we learn a new skill or sport. Just as our ancestors knew and practiced, this will involve our Mind &amp; Body in connection with the planet and its living things. What affect others affects us as well  we all live in the same fish thank. The last chapter explains numerology and its meaning in our everyday life, because every fruit has its season! 
All through the book I use simple explanations about my understandings of the process of life to make it easy for you. I hope you will find your Self in this book. My life has been a continuous investigation into the mystery of the human Mind &amp; Body behaviour. I have been using these same five steps in my life, starting from the bottom and heading towards the top. The process continues.
                                                       God bless you, Gianluca Boschi
