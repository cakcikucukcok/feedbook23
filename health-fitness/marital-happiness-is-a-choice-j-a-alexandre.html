  <title>Marital Happiness Is a Choice - J.A. Alexandre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I urge everyone who wants to understand just how wonderful marriage can be to read and reread this book. But I also urge psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, pastors, missionaries, and lay counselors to study it as well. I urge them because it not only covers a host of important aspects of marriage and includes practical tips but it also has deep spiritual and emotional concepts and even unconscious personality dynamics and how we all, to one extent or another, deceive ourselves in many ways that are detrimental to our marriages (Paul Meier, MD, founder of the national chain of Meier Clinics).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll never be happy in your marriage if you dont deal with issues head on, such as communication, conflict resolution, and intimacy. J. A. Alexandre, a pastor and relationship expert, helps you build and maintain a loving relationship with your spouse in this guidebook to marital bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll learn how to&lt;/p&gt;
rekindle the flame of love that brought you together,
avoid choices and situations that could endanger your marriage,
get the maximum amount of enjoyment in being with your partner, and
recognize the needs that arent being met (including your own).
&lt;p&gt;By revealing results from surveys hes conducted during marital retreats, the author shares specific behaviors that can cause trouble in a marriage. More importantly, he provides ideas and guidance on how to overcome problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless if you are contemplating marriage, already married, or seeking to help couples, youll understand that marital happiness is a choice by seeking to understand the Word of God while confronting the challenges of everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
