  <title>How To Quit Smoking and Save Your Life - Brian A Keelan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How To Quit Smoking and Save Your Life Unless a smoker is properly prepared to deal with the nicotine cravings that plague them after they have smoked what they hope will be their last cigarette, the odds against their success at quitting smoking are stacked against them. About 20% of the population smokes and they smoke for one reason and one reason only: they are addicted to the drug nicotine - an addiction that is considered to be one of the most difficult addictions to kick. For instance: if 1,000 smokers try to quit smoking today, about 930 of them will fail. Of the 70 smokers who make it, 56 of them will do it cold turkey. That means that all those other quit smoking methods, products and programs will only help 14 out of 1,000 smokers succeed at quitting smoking forever. I am part of that statistic because over a 40 year period, I smoked a minimum of one package of cigarettes every day (that&amp;rsquo;s over 300,000 cigarettes) and, I failed to quit on over 70 different occasions. I eventually came to think that quitting smoking was so difficult to do that it would be impossible for me to accomplish. Then, I learned how to do it and then&amp;hellip; I did it&amp;hellip; over 5,640 days, 112,000 cigarettes and $47,000 after-tax dollars ago. Most smokers have been conditioned to believe that their best chance of success at quitting smoking forever is to rely upon prescription drugs or other forms of nicotine products - pills, patches, gums, e-cigarettes etc. These methods have an embarrassing failure rate but an incredible marketing and advertising budget. They offer a &amp;ldquo;solution&amp;rdquo; to the addicted smoker that is like trying to quit drinking by switching from 80 proof vodka to 60 proof vodka and gradually weaning yourself off the drug you are addicted to. Try running that concept past the folks at AA. That&amp;rsquo;s where How To Quit Smoking and Save Your Life will help smokers - by showing them how to get themselves prepared and able to deal with what will come their way after they smoke their last cigarette. The message to smokers who want to quit is this: Learning how to do something before you try to do it will make it easier to do&amp;hellip; much easier. So then&amp;hellip; how do you learn how to quit smoking? The technique for learning how to quit smoking is no different than any of the other skills you have learned throughout your life. You identify exactly what it is you need to learn. Then you learn everything about it. (the more you learn, the better you&amp;rsquo;ll get.) Then you do it. You may not get it right the first time but you&amp;rsquo;ll get better if you approach quitting smoking from the point of view that you are in the process of learning how to do it and you are prepared and motivated to do whatever it takes to do that. All you need then is persistence&amp;hellip; and this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
