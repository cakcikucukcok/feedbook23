  <title>Wisdom of the Diamond - Don Levin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;As timeless as the rules established by Abner Doubleday to govern the play of America&#39;s national past time, baseball, the five bases of effective team leadership are presented in a light hearted story with Little League baseball as the backdrop against which these lessons are illustrated and learned.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Trey Langston, a regional sales manager for a large national sales organization is struggling to lead his team of sales representatives. Rising costs and competition as well as other challenges have forced him to examine just what kind of manager and leader he has become. A devoted father and little league coach, Trey soon discovers that the answers to all of the challenges that have eluded him at the office can be discovered between the chalk lines of the little league baseball diamond as he leads his team, and he himself receives gently mentoring from a devoted fan of the game. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
