  <title>Compound Yield - Robert K. Naguszewski Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Complacent money will be taken by traders! Traditional 401Ks are hopelessly handicapped in providing for your retirement. You must act on your own behalf. By focusing on yield and then compounding it, the Compound Yield formula produces measurably increasing income that can be either reinvested, for those not yet retired, or drawn upon by those already retired. The formula is easy to learn and execute consistently for dramatic results. The odds enhancer leads to a geometric change for the portfolio beyond compound interest alone. It takes things easily to the next level. Simple mathematical computations allow the user to progressively increase income regardless of portfolio value. Objectives can be calculated and met over and over again monthly. Results should become easier to meet over time as the portfolio is placed on an exponential trajectory. The best of investing for high yield is magnified by safe tradingthere are no losing trades because the outcome is known before a trade is considered. You can see the plan unfold for you. The volatility of your portfolio actually decreases as a consequence of safe trading followed by reinvesting according to specific simple, if not obvious, rules. Marked risk-management follows as a natural consequence of just following the plan. What to do in any market direction becomes obvious. The Compound Yield strategy magnifies income regardless of the direction of individual holdings in your portfolio. How to choose what holdings are worthwhile is explained. Choices are wide open. The formula can be used collaboratively with almost any other strategy. The choice is yours. Being active in your retirement account is important and is made rational and fairly simple by this process. Can you afford another lost decade?" />
