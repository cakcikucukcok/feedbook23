  <title>Kiss&#39;d - Lady T</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What do you do when youve been married to a man for 30 years and he becomes a different person to you?  You become afraid for your life but youre having a hard time of letting go, of deciding if you should leave.  If you stay you may become a statistic, and/or a victim.
I chose to stay because we had longevity and  years of memories, which was probably not a good reason.  I didnt think of his name calling, arguing, etc. as abuse and thats how we women trick ourselves.  We dont equate the mental/emotional abuse in the same category as the physical abuse.  Face it ladies, lets keep it real-we all get Im not letting another woman have what it took syndrome.
KISSD is a book written with separation/divorce, African American women and the abuse we suffer in mind, based on my personal experience.  This is a straight to the point book about surviving the emotional and physical issues of separation and/or divorce.  Kept in Silence Surviving Divorce because most women dont know what they are entitled to and in the case of abuse they dont report it for various reasons.  African American women make up the biggest statistics; maybe thats why its called an unreported epidemic." />
