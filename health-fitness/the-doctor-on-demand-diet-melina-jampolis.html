  <title>The Doctor On Demand Diet - Melina Jampolis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A companion to the highly popular Doctor On Demand telemedicine app, &lt;i&gt;The Doctor On Demand Diet&lt;/i&gt; provides a customized eating, exercise, and behavioral plan that optimizes your chances of success without forcing you to eliminate any major food groups.    &lt;i&gt;The Doctor On Demand Diet&lt;/i&gt; begins with the 10-day CleanStart phase, designed to control hunger without compromising nutrition by focusing on higher-protein foods and reducing fat and carbs-especially sugar, dry carbs, and bread. Next, the 10-day Customize Your Carbs phase personalizes your eating plan to match your own individual metabolic profile. Then, the Cycle for Success phase creates a more flexible plan that provides continued weight loss while preventing frustrating weight-loss plateaus.   Along the way, practical advice, real-life patient stories, and targeted findings from the latest scientific studies show how basic lifestyle changes can boost your health while you slim down. A simple exercise quiz pinpoints your exercise &quot;personality&quot; and gives customized, practical, and fun exercise suggestions. Mental health self-checks help you gauge whether emotional roadblocks stand between you and your goals, and delicious chef-designed recipes and meal templates make it a snap to prepare healthy, tasty meals.   With a program that fits perfectly into your life, &lt;i&gt;The Doctor On Demand Diet&lt;/i&gt; provides a clear, customizable roadmap that can help you lose weight and keep it off for good." />
