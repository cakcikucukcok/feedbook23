  <title>Power of the Universe Lies Within You - Pradipta Kumar Das.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book delves deep into the genesis and power of human thought. Human civilization has consistently grown over few millennia but the exponential growth during last few centuries of industrialization and particularly during the last half a century due to digital revolution can be attributed to one single phenomenon called Human Thought Processes. The idea of an acronym for Generation, Operation and Destruction (G-O-D) by human thought has a spiritual background based on Karmic Principles, argues the author in the book. The delicate balance in the brain chemicals that are responsible for harmonious thought processes can sometimes be severely derailed due to modern day anxiety and stress causing immense agonies leading to serious mental health problems. The author had a firsthand experience of such a mental health crisis in July 2000 while during his PhD study in Adelaide, Australia almost leading to a Near Death Experience which he not only survived but could convert the crisis into an opportunity to harvest immense knowledge and wisdom for self-growth.
The author has adopted partly an autobiographical approach to put across ideas that he thinks can find some resonance with people struggling to overcome similar mental health problems in life. While researching into concepts of life after death, he raises few questions about the current understanding of human consciousness. The ultimate realization of the author that Humans are infinite spiritual beings in finite bodies has been systematically and logically brought out to enable a conviction that mental health problems are better handled with medico-spiritual practices. The title of the book suggests that to achieve happiness and bliss in life, human beings anywhere in this world need not search elsewhere because it is all there within. The author has outlined all the practical steps which helped him not only overcome his serious crisis but achieve his desired goals and thus sublime happiness. He strongly believes in the universal application of the principles enumerated." />
