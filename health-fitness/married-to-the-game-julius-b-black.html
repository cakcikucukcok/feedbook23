  <title>Married to the Game - Julius B. Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Infamous lives in a world of manicured lawns, neatly maintained calenders, drugs and violence.With no one to live for but her girls, Infamous lives in commitment and supreme sacrafice.     &lt;br&gt;         
        Julius lives in a world that was shattered by a prison sentence and now he&#39;s trying to put the pieces back together again. He has vowed to himself  to never be the man he was and has forsaken the life he once knew, running one of the most powerful street drug rings in all of Louisville. &lt;br&gt;
       Through the hands of creative fate, Infamous and Julius are brought together through their passion for music, but suddenly their lives clash. Infamous finds herself falling for a &quot;square&quot;, and Julius finds out that the thug in him is alive and well.&lt;br&gt;
       Their tale is one of love, hate, intrigue and betrayal, set to the pace of the streets. Their triumph over personal pains and hardships inspires us all.
