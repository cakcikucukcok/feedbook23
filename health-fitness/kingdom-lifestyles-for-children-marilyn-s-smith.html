  <title>Kingdom Lifestyles for Children - Marilyn S. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kingdom Lifestyle series are classic stories that are designed to build strong, godly character in children. It teaches them how to live in Gods kingdom by having a personal relationship with him, obeying his laws, becoming shining lights as they stand out in their world, captivating the mind of Christ. The Bible teaches us to remember our Creator now, in the days of our youth, before the days of trouble come (Ecclesiastes 12:1). Children, because they obey Gods laws, will be just like Christ and, like adults, will not only develop the mind of Christ but also bear spiritual fruits given in Galatians 5:22: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. You will gradually see changes in your childs attitude as you read these wonderful stories to them. They are excellent as bedtime stories. Godly characteristics include telling the truth, making the best choices, honesty, showing kindness, standing up for what is right. The characters in these stories are children who are not perfect but are trying all they can to please God and make a difference in their world. They possess a passion for doing the right thing to please God. As parents, we have an obligation to teach our children Gods laws so that they can become what he made them to be. Children will enjoy these real-life stories as they grow in godly living. Becoming like Jesus in daily living is the way to go. Gods kingdom reflects a group of chosen people (1 Peter 2:10). The kingdom is a place where God reigns, where his will is done. He is king and gives blessings to his children who obey his laws. Gods kingdom provides true hope, peace, joy, and prosperity in the world. We are to let our lights shine (Matthew 5:1416)." />
