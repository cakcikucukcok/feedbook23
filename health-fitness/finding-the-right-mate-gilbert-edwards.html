  <title>Finding the Right Mate - Gilbert Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author will try to explain and encourage those that are seeking to marry that marriage is a holy estate instituted by God.  Marriage was ordained for the life-long companionship, help and comfort which husbands and wives ought to have for each other.  The authors deepest focus points are:  Life-long Marriage and Finding the Right Mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many married couples do not keep the marriage vows they made.  Because of that, I recommend marital counseling before marriage.  The author does not focus too much on divorce because of his disbelief in divorce.  It was Moses that executed the bill of divorce.  He did it to protect the women because husbands would divorce their wives for anything just to marry another woman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women have a moral personality and are not a thing that men may hand over to another, and then take her back again at his pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author believes there is not law instituting or commanding divorce.  Most people use Matthew 19:9, where Jesus was only explaining what Moses meant.  The marriage that God wants is a marriage of a life-long commitment; a forever happy home!&lt;/p&gt;" />
