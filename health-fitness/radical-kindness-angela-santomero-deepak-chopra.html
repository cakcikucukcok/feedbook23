  <title>Radical Kindness - Angela Santomero, Deepak Chopra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The beloved creator of Blues Clues and Daniel Tiger&amp;#8217;s Neighborhood and prot&amp;#233;g&amp;#233; of Fred Rogers explores the importance of kindness and how it can change your life in this essential guide and tie-in to the PBS special, &amp;#8220;The Power of Radical Kindness.&amp;#8221;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Angela C. Santomero, the creator, executive producer, and head writer of many of today&amp;#8217;s most popular educational children&amp;#8217;s shows believes in the radical power of kindness, on her shows, and in her life. Inspired by her mentor Fred Rogers, beloved host of the classic, award-winning PBS show Mister Rogers&amp;#8217; Neighborhood, Angela has dedicated her life to teaching others that when you treat yourself and others with warmth, empathy, and respect, life changing benefits follows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the true meaning of self-care and the gift of vulnerability, to the importance of active listening or the magic of asking for help, Radical Kindness goes beyond The Golden Rule and entreaties to &amp;#8220;be nice,&amp;#8221; contending that kindness is the key to recognizing others, and ourselves, as worthy of love and understanding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much like gratitude, Angela contends we need a kindness practice. A practice in which we learn to see with our hearts and act from a place of compassion. As the Dalai Lama says, &amp;#8220;Be kind whenever possible. It is always possible.&amp;#8221; Through practicing radical kindness&amp;#8212;toward ourselves, with loved ones, and to the world at large&amp;#8212;we can transform ourselves, our neighborhood, and our world for the better. &lt;/p&gt;" />
