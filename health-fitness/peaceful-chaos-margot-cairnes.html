  <title>Peaceful Chaos - Margot Cairnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Peaceful Chaos, the Art of Leadership in Time of Rapid Change&lt;/i&gt; is one of very few books that will help express your humanity at work. While many consider the business environment to be incompatible with individual growth, this book shows that you can purse your self awareness, personal and even spiritual development in ways that will also enhance your business success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margot Cairnes, Principal of her own Sydney-based company, The Change Dynamic, is a University Medallist from Sydney University and an MBA with experiences ranging from university lecturing to being Chief Executive of a group of companies. She is a recognised authority in organisational change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Peaceful Chaos&lt;/i&gt; she will lead you through a series of ideas, case studies and exercises that will have you embracing in new and exciting ways. You will find yourself referring to her wisdom for many years as you travel with the author on a journey that is guaranteed to help you move from chaos to peace of mind and strategic success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essential reading for personal growth by any person working in a business including the Managing Director, Quality Manager and Change Agent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Others have Said: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Peaceful Chaos&lt;/i&gt; is one of the first books to successfully explore the pivotal connection between individual fulfilment and corporate strategy. The chapter Strategy in Motion is essential reading for every executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;Robert Bruce, Adviser in Strategic Management
Visiting Fellow, MBA Programme, Macquarie University&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This is a very special book. Firstly, it is Australian, written by one of our foremst authorities on the nature of change, and therefore entirely relevant to our local culture and conditions... The book reflects Stephen Conveys approach in &lt;i&gt;The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. Peaceful Chaos&lt;/i&gt; deserves to be every bit as well known. &lt;/p&gt;
