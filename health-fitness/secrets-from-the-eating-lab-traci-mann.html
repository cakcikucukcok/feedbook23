  <title>Secrets From the Eating Lab - Traci Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A provocative expose of the dieting industry from one of the nation&amp;#8217;s leading researchers in self-control and the psychology of weight loss that offers proven strategies for sustainable weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From her office in the University of Minnesota&amp;#8217;s Health and Eating Lab, professor Traci Mann researches self-control and dieting. And what she has discovered is groundbreaking. Not only do diets &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;work; they often result in weight gain. Americans are losing the battle of the bulge because our bodies and brains are not hardwired to resist food&amp;#8212;the very idea of it works against our biological imperative to survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Secrets From the Eating Lab&lt;/em&gt;, Mann challenges assumptions&amp;#8212;including those that make up the very foundation of the weight loss industry&amp;#8212;about how diets work and why they fail. The result of more than two decades of research, it offers cutting-edge science and exciting new insights into the American obesity epidemic and our relationship with eating and food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secrets From the Eating Lab&lt;/em&gt; also gives readers the practical tools they need to actually lose weight and get healthy. Mann argues that the idea of willpower is a myth&amp;#8212;we shouldn&amp;#8217;t waste time and money trying to combat our natural tendencies. Instead, she offers 12 simple, effective strategies that take advantage of human nature instead of fighting it&amp;#8212;from changing the size of your plates to socializing with people with healthy habits, removing &amp;#8220;healthy&amp;#8221; labels that send negative messages to redefining comfort food.&lt;/p&gt;" />
