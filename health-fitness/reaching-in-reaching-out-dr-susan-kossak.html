  <title>Reaching In, Reaching Out - Dr. Susan Kossak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote Reaching In, Reaching Out: Reflections on Reciprocal Mentoring to show readers what I myself have learned as a mentor, professor, clinical social worker, and consultant who teaches others about the mentoring relationship. 
&lt;p&gt;
Both a resource on mentoring and the inspiring story of my journey with my mentee, Johnnetta McSwain, Reaching In, Reaching Out is fundamentally comprised of conversations between Johnnetta and myself in which the reader is invited to take part. This book is so much more than a simple guide to mentoring because our own mentoring relationship has taught us much about interactions with otherswith family, friends, and most importantly, with the self. 
&lt;p&gt;
A key message that we share is that healthy relationships are reciprocal. The book shows readers exactly what this kind of healthy interdependence means and how to apply this valuable principle to their own livesall through the story of two women from very different worlds whose incredible bond makes a world of difference 
&lt;p&gt;
I wish you well as you discover the beauty of interdependence on your own path of personal and professional growth.&lt;br&gt;
