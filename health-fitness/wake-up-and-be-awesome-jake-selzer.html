&lt;p&gt;Wake Up and Be Awesome are all things that the words portray in each of our hearts and minds. I hope for everyone to not only follow the teaching, methods and stories I am about to share but also to provide you with the tools to change your lifestyle and help you increase your knowledge in order to make the decision that will profit your peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to make this book unique to all others by writing from my heart and leaving a part of myself in each page for the reader to connect with. This book is a personal journey for each individual reader and I hope you enjoy every page as much as I did writing it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
