  <title>Have Your Cupcake &amp; Eat It Too! - Lynda Jamysen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have Your Cupcake &amp; Eat It Too!So What Does This Mean Exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of you are familiar with the saying, You cant have your cake and eat it too. What this generally means is that you cannot or should not have or want more than you deserve or can handle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this saying is basically telling you that you get what you deserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who determines what you deserve? Or another way to ask this question is Who do you let make the determination of what you deserve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you let parents, friends, mate, church, religion, society, peers, fate, or all of the above tell you what you deserve? Is what you deserve determined by anyone or anything else other than you? Maybe God should make the final determination of what you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are so used to being told who we are by others (pick all or any on the list above) that we have no sense of who we really are or that we can have anything we want or desire. Deserving has nothing to do with it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where all the judgment comes into play. Without judgment, there is no concept of deserving. You must be judged in order to determine if you deserve something or not, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what if there were no judgment? What would that world look like? What if there were only acceptance and unconditional love? What if from womb to grave, all you ever experienced was acceptance and unconditional love from within and without? No judgment from inside your own head or from anyone you knew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you think that would feel?  Think about it&lt;/p&gt;" />
