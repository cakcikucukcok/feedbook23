  <title>Overcoming Celebrity Obsession - Diane Saks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OVERCOMING CELEBRITY OBSESSION&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;is a star-studded journey from celebrity obsession to fulfilling life in three easy phases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a fan is obsessed, a story character version of the celebrity is created. It is through the fans celebrity characterization that guides the fan through Phase 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon understanding why the fan was obsessed in the first place, the journey through Phase 2 begins. This is the dark part of the fans life that the fan used the favorite celebrity to escape from. Professional counseling is not recommended in Phase 1, but can begin in Phase 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get the most from Phase 3, the fan must be able to look at parts of his or her real life and pull out the celebrity obsession. For example, every time someone couldnt communicate or understand me, I saw that as my John Travolta obsession. If I was not given a chance to help out during a particular event, that was my David Cassidy obsession. It is in Phase 3 where we discuss personal behavior and set goals both professional and personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The typical celebrity obsession theory is, the obsession is because of hero worship. Until now, celebrity obsession therapy has been in the hands of professionals who have never lived through celebrity obsession. Typical celebrity obsession studies state, that obsessed people need to stop obsessing over celebrities and get on with life. Diane knows better than that. She believes the fan needs to take some time to celebrity obsess while in&lt;em&gt;OVERCOMING CELEBRITY OBSESSION&lt;/em&gt;in order to work through what is stopping the fan from getting the most out of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why would you want to put your celebrity obsession into the hands of someone with an advanced college degree or two, who has never been celebrity obsessed?&lt;/p&gt;" />
