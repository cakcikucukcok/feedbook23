  <title>Your Personal Titanic - Making the Greatest Possible Difference With the Rest of Your Life - Ronald P. Hutchcraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Titanic. It was a blockbuster movie, an award-winning Broadway show, the subject of best-selling books, and one dramatic, tragic night in history that has intrigued generation after generation. For the seven hundred survivors, the images of that horrific April night in the North Atlantic were unforgettable. Why did more than fifteen hundred passengers and crew die? It&amp;#39;s not because the Titanic sank, but because the people who were already saved would not go back to rescue others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Could this be a spiritual picture of us: the people who are already saved doing nothing about the dying people all around us? By God&amp;#39;s grace we are in the Jesus lifeboat, saved and headed for heaven. All around us&amp;mdash;where we work, where we live, where we shop or go to school&amp;mdash;are people who will die spiritually unless someone rescues them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a sense, God has placed us close to these spiritually lost and dying people so we might man the lifeboats that give them hope of being rescued. Will we turn our lifeboats around? Will we take the risks to give them a chance to live&amp;mdash;forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rescuing the spiritually dying is life or death. We have nothing more urgent, more significant to do than to help the people we know into the lifeboat before they slip away forever. Jesus is summoning you today to join Him in the rescue mission for which He died." />
