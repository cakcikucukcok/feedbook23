  <title>Core Envy: A 3-Step Guide to a Strong, Sexy Core - Allison Westfahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allison Westfahl&#39;s Core Envy will tone and sculpt your abs, back, stomach, and sides-and build a strong, sexy core you&#39;ll love showing off.&lt;/b&gt; Her &lt;em&gt;Core Envy&lt;/em&gt; program solves the problems other abs programs ignore with a three-part approach to slim down and tone up. You&#39;ll clean up your diet, fire up your metabolism, and tighten up all the muscles of your core without a gym or equipment. In just three weeks, you&#39;ll start seeing results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westfahl is an acclaimed personal trainer who developed her effective core sculpting program for women at several of the nation&#39;s most prestigious health clubs. Her clients came to her because they were frustrated by traditional abs programs that involved impossible diets, endless cardio and crunches, sketchy supplements, and tedious calorie counting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allison&#39;s 8-week Core Envy program is a better way to tone and sculpt.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt;Core Envy&lt;/em&gt; lays out a triple threat of cardio workouts, sculpting routines, and a diet makeover. It&#39;s a balanced approach that promotes both fitness and weight loss, and you won&#39;t need a gym to make it happen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allison&#39;s cardio and sculpting workouts average just 30 minutes and don&#39;t require special equipment. Her high-intensity cardio workouts coupled with full core functional exercises will make sure you slim down while you sculpt all the muscle groups you need for a sleek, toned core. Three levels let you amp it up or tone it down to match your current fitness level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allison streamlines dieting with healthy, flavorful foods and snacks that will keep you energized as you rev up your metabolism. Her tasty recipes and complete meal plans simplify calorie counting and make weight loss painless. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core Envy&lt;/em&gt; will help you get the sleek, sculpted core you want. After Westfahl&#39;s 8-week program, you&#39;ll look great and feel confident rocking a fit and feminine look. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allison Westfahl is an exercise physiologist, certified personal trainer, and fitness nutrition specialist.&lt;/b&gt; After earning an undergraduate degree from Yale, Westfahl moved to Denver to pursue a career in helping people live a healthy, active lifestyle. She quickly made her mark on the industry, becoming the youngest-ever Director of Personal Training at a nationally top-rated health club. She has managed and directed personal training teams at high-end health clubs in Boulder and Denver since 2003. Westfahl is known for for creating innovative, effective core strength and sculpting routines. She has trained elite professional athletes, helped choreograph workout videos for Gaiam, and been featured in publications ranging from Shape to Bicycling to the Denver Post. She holds an MS in exercise science and a coaching certification from USA Triathlon, and has earned a CPT, PES, and FNS from the National Academy of Sports Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;" />
