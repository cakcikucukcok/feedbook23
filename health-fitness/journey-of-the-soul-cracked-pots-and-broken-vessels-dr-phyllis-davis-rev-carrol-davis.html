  <title>Journey of the Soul...Cracked Pots and Broken Vessels - Dr. Phyllis Davis, Rev. Carrol Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discover your story, learn how to tell it, and watch God perform miracles in your life as you fall more in love with your Abba Father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God uses cracked pots and broken vessels to tell His story: And they overcame by the power of the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony Revelation 12:11 KJV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God doesnt waste anything or anyone. He takes the scars and pain of your life and turns you into the vessel of His glory you were created to be. Nothing surprises God. He has a plan to redeem you, save you, and let His light shine through you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Christians walk in bondage for failure to know and follow the Word of God. The Bible is Christs love letter to you, an instruction book to guide you through all of lifes difficulties. Who better to direct you through uncertain times than the one who knows of the best plans for your life? Yet Christ says his people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gods Word rightly applied to the strongholds in your life can help you live the abundant life Christ died to give you and set the captives free. It is not just a matter of salvation, but rather growth in Christthe sanctification processthat leads you to the rich and abundant life Christ died to give you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your testimony? It isnt just your story of salvation. Tell of your journey and how the Lord allowed the Scriptures to come alive in your life. Tell of the living Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;" />
