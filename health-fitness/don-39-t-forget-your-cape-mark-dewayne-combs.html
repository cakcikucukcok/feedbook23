  <title>Don&#39;t Forget Your Cape - Mark DeWayne Combs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;re being watched... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;You may not realize it, and the person watching you may never clue you in, but you&amp;rsquo;re being watched. It happens each day in the most undetectable way. Somewhere, someone is watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we work our way through each day, there are moments when we may feel as if we disappear into the background and get lost in the shuffle as humanity passes by. There may be times when we even relish those moments, when we look for the opportunity to slide between the cracks and step into our&amp;nbsp;easy-to-overlook, Plain Jane mode. I would contend that even in those times, somewhere, someone is watching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You touch more lives and topple more dominoes than you could ever imagine. For someone, you are the light in their darkness or the example to which they aspire. Completely disconnecting from the society in which we live is impossible. Even in death, our&amp;nbsp;lives continue to touch others, both in the moment and as time slowly passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t Forget Your Cape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;doesn&amp;rsquo;t dance off into the fancy world of who each person can be. I&amp;rsquo;ve always left that &amp;ldquo;think your way to wonderful&amp;rdquo; philosophy to other writers. It just doesn&amp;rsquo;t suit me and I&amp;rsquo;d bet that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really suit you either. I&amp;rsquo;d rather be a part of a&amp;nbsp;face-to-face journey that cuts through the fog and connects me with who I am. That&amp;rsquo;s where my value can be found and that&amp;rsquo;s where this journey takes each reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on the story-telling style that made PUSH such a popular read, Don&amp;#39;t Forget Your Cape mixes personal stories with pop-culture headlines and historical events to open a window into thought that brings each reader face-to-face with their own self-worth and potential.&lt;/p&gt;" />
