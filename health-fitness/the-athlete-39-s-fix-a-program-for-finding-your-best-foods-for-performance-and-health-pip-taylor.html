  <title>The Athlete&#39;s Fix: A Program for Finding Your Best Foods for Performance and Health - Pip Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Recent studies show that food intolerances are almost 5 times more prevalant today than in the 1950s; as many as 1 in 6 Americans is estimated to have a food sensitivity. Exercise can make food intolerances even worse for endurance athletes. Food cravings, GI distress, headaches, brain fog--these common reactions can be more than symptoms of a tough workout. They could be caused by the foods you eat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Athlete&#39;s Fix&lt;/i&gt;, registered dietitian Pip Taylor will help you find your problem foods--and the foods that make you feel and perform your best.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Athlete&#39;s Fix&lt;/i&gt; offers a sensible, 3-step program to identify food intolerances, navigate popular special diets, and develop your own customized clean diet that will support better health and performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endurance sports stress the body, often worsening mild food sensitivities and causing symptoms like GI distress, food cravings, and headaches. Many athletes aggressively eliminate foods as a one-size-fits-all solution. These restrictive diets sometimes bring short-term improvements, but they are difficult to maintain and often leave athletes undernourished and underperforming. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Athlete&#39;s Fix&lt;/i&gt; offers a smarter, fine-tuned approach.&lt;/b&gt; Taylor will show how you will benefit most from a diet full of a wide variety of foods. You&#39;ll improve your daily diet, cut out common irritants, then add back foods until you feel great enjoying your own personalized clean diet. To help with this transition, &lt;i&gt;The Athlete&#39;s Fix&lt;/i&gt; offers 50 recipes using easily tolerated foods that support a base functional diet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Athlete&#39;s Fix&lt;/i&gt; examines hot issues for athletes like: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Celiac disease, gluten intolerance, gluten-free and grain-free diets&lt;li&gt;Lactose intolerance &lt;li&gt;FODMAPs and specific carbohydrate intolerances, including fructose&lt;li&gt;Reactions to food chemicals such as salicylates, amines, and glutamates&lt;li&gt;Inflammatory foods&lt;li&gt;Food sensitivity testing and elimination diets&lt;li&gt;Popular special diet programs like Paleo, Whole30, Dukan, Mediterranean, and Dash&lt;li&gt;Vegetarian, vegan, and raw food diets&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Athlete&#39;s Fix&lt;/i&gt; will help you isolate and identify your food intolerances while enabling you to eat the widest possible variety of healthy foods.
