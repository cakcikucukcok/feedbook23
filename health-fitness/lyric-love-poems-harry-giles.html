  <title>Lyric Love Poems - Harry Giles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When I started a school for our children with my wife, I knew almost nothing about preuniversity education. My education at the University level included English, religion, psychology, law, science, and mathematics.I had 12 years of University study, although most of my learning came from my private reading.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Faced with what I did not know I had to answer, or find the answers to many questions:&lt;br /&gt;
How did I get an IQ opf 195?&lt;br /&gt;
How can one increase, if one ca, the IQ in all children;&lt;br /&gt;
How can one educate children not only in the pitiful, limited deprival of education that characterizes our society;&lt;br /&gt;
How can we educate them so that they all come mentally healthy?&lt;br /&gt;
If we are educating them bilingually, or multilingually, how can this be done to a high level without stress;&lt;br /&gt;
What are the best texts in English, or French, where are they from;&lt;br /&gt;
What is the best time to start an enriched education;&lt;br /&gt;
What are the best examining centers in English;&lt;br /&gt;
From what countries do the best teachers come from;&lt;br /&gt;
What are the most successful methodologies for teaching anything?&lt;br /&gt;
What is the appropriate class size for superlearning;&lt;br /&gt;
What is the best way to teach tolerance, love, and democracy;&lt;br /&gt;
How can a child be persuaded to try beyond his normal skill level;&lt;br /&gt;
What extra languages are most appropriate;&lt;br /&gt;
What changes in curriculum are required to ensure that both boys, and girls are equally facile in all areas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
