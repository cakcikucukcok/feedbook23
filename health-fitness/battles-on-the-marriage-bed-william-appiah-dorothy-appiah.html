  <title>BATTLES ON THE MARRIAGE BED - William Appiah, Dorothy Appiah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The issue of misunderstanding, arguments and disagreements if not well handled, leads to anger in marriage. Anger is an emotion which is not simple to deal with. You hurt yourself and your marriage when you become held up in anger, bitterness, resentment, and revenge. In the process, you put yourself at risk and experience health problems, sleeping difficulties, depression, relationship rifts, and daily confrontation with your spouse among others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You automatically increase your stress level and decrease your enjoyment of a healthy marriage life. The longer you carry the anger, the heavier it gets and therefore affects your marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Resolving Conflicts In Marriage,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; is &amp;nbsp;written to inform and educate married couples about some of the characteristics of anger in marriage, what one need to look out for and the effects of anger in marital relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book warns couples about the dangers of too much attention to social media instead of communicating effectively and provide solutions. It brings your attention to the issue of conflict resolution in marriage. The bible encourages couples to resolve issues amicably. It provides you with the necessary steps to how to resolve the conflicts so that you can enjoy your marriage to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should also make sure you rout any &amp;ldquo;little foxes&amp;rdquo; that may serve to destroy the ultimate goal of enjoying happiness and the desired fulfilment in your marriage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
