  <title>Silent Body, Vibrant Mind - Peter Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2001 Peter Anderson was 37 and had the perfect life: very much in love and recently married with an infant daughter he adored; an intelligent and sensitive man working a job he loved as a popular secondary school teacher and a talented sportsman training for a marathon...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bubble was about to burst.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Peter was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease (MND), a physically crippling disease that destroys nerve cells controlling muscular movement. He was told that over time his body would cease to function - yet his mind, his memory and his feelings would be untouched by the disease. His life expectancy was two years. Incredibly, eleven years on, despite Peter&#39;s body wasting away, his mind remains as it has always been: strong and vibrant, intelligent, enquiring, touched with gentle humour.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Silent Body - Vibrant Mind has been written with often unimaginable physical difficulty. An unforgettable story about what matters in life." />
