  <title>Called to War: Out of the Stands.... Into the Arena - Art Hobba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Christian radio talk show host asked the well known women&#39;s ministry leader the question, &quot;So what do you think about the statement that men in the church have been feminized?&quot; Her immediate response was, &quot;I totally disagree. Men in American have not been feminized at all...they have been emasculated. Men don&#39;t feel a need to be more like women...they just have lost their identity as men.&quot;This book begins with the true story told by a washed up minister whom God forgave, healed, restored, and reenlisted in his service. The real story lies, however, how a few men, discontented with the detachment of men in their church and inspired by the Holy Spirit, discovered a pathway to re-engagement as God&#39;s man in this hour...or maybe real engagement for the very first time. Many of you, who chose to read this book, may have suffered through some potentially debilitating failures. We have much in common, my friend. In fact, I have learned to not trust a man until he has shown me his scars.Welcome to Warrior Boot Camp! The reader will take a journey through a season of breaking down and shredding of the things of this world that have insidiously crept like tendrils into our hearts and minds. We will then explore the practical military view, including strategies and tactics, that is pervasive throughout scripture, regarding our calling to engage and win the spiritual war against our three foes:-The world system- The carnal human nature- The demonic spiritual realm led by SatanThe second half of the book builds up the reader with the understanding of how to dress for success in the Kingdom by &quot;putting on&quot; and effectively fighting in God&#39;s armor (Ephesians 6). Warriors must be expert in weaponry and the invisible war of the Spirit is not the exception but the rule.The real hero of this Warrior saga is Gideon (Judges 6-8). We will get into his shoes as he hides in the wine press...and then into his head, and finally, his heart as he is transformed from fearful farmer to mighty warrior. Together we will explore the common threads of manhood as lived out by the greatest warrior in Israel&#39;s history. &quot;Called to War will most assuredly be compared with Wild at Heart and Raising a Modern Day Knight. Art Hobba&#39;s resourcefulness takes new ground earning inclusion in this unique fellowship of unabashed Servant Warriors. Men-of-God, saddle up; you have been Called to War!&quot;-- Marc Stein, President, Gospel Light WorldwideBe ready for a major paradigm shift in how you view life itself...and be prepared, like Gideon, to be called and equipped to get out of the stands of hiding and isolation and into the battle arena of victory. In these pages are unlocked the truths of walking in the sustainable freedom all men yearn for. Join Gideon as he begins to believe and then become the man God dreamed when He made him...and receive with him, God&#39;s new name for you as &quot;Mighty Warrior!&quot;" />
