  <title>Face It and Fix It - Ken Seeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;World-renowned interventionist Ken Seeley, one of the hosts of A&amp;E&#39;s hit television series &lt;em&gt;Intervention&lt;/em&gt;, has spent the past twenty years helping people and their families deal with and overcome life-threatening addictions. His clients have ranged from the homeless to multimillionaires, each needing professional help with every problem imaginable, including alcoholism, drug dependency, excessive gambling, sexual addiction, abusive behavior, and mental disorders. A few years into his career, Ken realized that the one common characteristic with each of his clients was denial. He has since built his success on a proven program for pinpointing and dealing with this core issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether coping with a severe or a soft addiction, a life-threatening situation, or just an impediment to true happiness, we&#39;re all in denial about something. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might be small and seemingly innocent, such as the fact that you&#39;re not trying to excel in your job as much as you could or should be. Or it could be much larger and even potentially lethal, such as a full-blown addiction that at this very moment is destroying your life. The truth is, no matter who you are, no matter how small or large your problems may seem, denial is holding you back from living your life to the fullest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denial is the number one symptom of addiction. It&#39;s the mask that lets addicts ignore and avoid the consequences of their actions. But what most people don&#39;t know is that denial is also the fuel that creates an addiction in the first place&amp;#8212;as well as nearly every other disorder, behavior, and habit that can negatively affect your life. In &lt;em&gt;Face It and Fix It&lt;/em&gt;, Seeley leads readers through a three-step process to remove life-damaging denial in order to live balanced and healthy lives. He helps readers first to identify life-damaging behaviors; next he gives the tools necessary to break down the walls that denial builds up over time; and finally he shows how to maintain balanced lives and relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re looking for help for someone you love or struggling with an addiction of your own, &lt;em&gt;Face It and Fix It&lt;/em&gt; will leave you with a greater sense of self-awareness and the skills you need to both improve your relationships and to live the life you deserve.&lt;/p&gt;" />
