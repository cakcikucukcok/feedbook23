  <title>Family Bible Study Series - Eric C. Dohrmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you pray to God for wisdom, what is it that you are actually looking for?  Are you asking for God&#39;s understanding to sort out and find meaning about a particular problem you face? Are you seeking for the right judgment in an important decision youre making? Are you praying for God&#39;s advice and counsel about how to handle a particular circumstance or people you are working something out with?  Do you need to know the right thing He wants you to do about something?  Are you seeking Him for equality regarding a group decision to be made? Are you praying for God&#39;s guidance for knowledge and planning about a particular goal you wish to accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the ingredients of wisdom that Solomon included in his introduction to the book of Proverbs 1:1-7. This third book of the Family Bible Study Series, Growing In God&#39;s Wisdom, explains these words from their original Hebrew meaning and gives practical application in praying for them for our needs in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Family Bible Study Series was put together to be a very helpful tool for individuals and parents to have Bible studies for themselves and with the family.  Thus it also is an excellent benefit for the following: counselors, premarital and remarriage guidance, church leadership Bible study for support to individuals and family development, and youth group Bible studies. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy knowing and growing in the wonderful abundance of God&#39;s wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
