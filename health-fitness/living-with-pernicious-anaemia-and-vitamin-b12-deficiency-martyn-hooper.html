  <title>Living with Pernicious Anaemia and Vitamin B12 Deficiency - Martyn Hooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you have vitamin B12 deficiency? Do you know what the cause is? Are you getting B12 replacement injections? Then you should be back to normal - simple? This is what most doctors believe - that simply providing standard B12 replacement-treatment will return sufferers to &#39;normal&#39; and that they will be able to live just like people who do not have pernicious anaemia, or B12 deficiency from some other cause. All the textbooks say so. The general population - if they stop to give this some thought - will think the same. If you have pernicious anaemia - or B12 deficiency from some other cause - you may well know different. But you may think you are alone? In this book you will find you are not. Living with Pernicious Anaemia and Vitamin Deficiency includes: How vitamin deficiency continues to affect the lives of many sufferers; Practical guidance on how to deal with work and family issues; Insight into how other sufferers manage their ongoing symptoms; Real life case histories illustrating the wide range of problems sufferers face every day" />
