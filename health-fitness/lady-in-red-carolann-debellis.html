  <title>Lady in Red - Carolann deBellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;Lady in Red,Where is Your Head? by first-author Carolann deBellis, tells the story of a woman who survived a brain injury and a coma after a car accident on an icy New Jersey Turnpike in 1987, when she was 34. &lt;br /&gt;Carolann had it all, the perfect life, before the accident-a great job at a hot Philadelphia salon, a passionate 12-year marriage and a wide circle of friends and family who marveled at her energy and infectious spirit. &lt;br /&gt;Then, in the aftermath of the near-death accident, she lost it all-job, husband and sense of self. After learning to walk, talk and cut hair again, she faced the life-long task of going beyond recovery, beyond recreating the person she was before the accident to aspire for something better. Psychological counseling and the support of a loving circle of family and friends helped her to see that all was not perfect before the accident, helped her redefine a new Carolann, a work in progress whos less self absorbed and more self aware, less controlling and more open in her relationships with men in her life. &lt;br /&gt;If it werent for the imperative, painful job of remaking herself physically, cognitively and emotionally from a child-like state after the accident, Carolann might never have undertaken the intense personal journey that leads her today, at 57, to say I thank God my brain injury cured me. &lt;br /&gt;More than a conventional memoir or self-help guide, Lady in Red stitches together Carolanns own words, a diary that her cousin Michael Biello wrote during her coma and rehabilitation, hospital documents, notes from nurses and visitors and Carolanns collection of inspirational quotes. &lt;br /&gt;I wrote and rewrote this book over 20 years to help others who have suffered or know someone who has suffered a brain injury, Carolann says. Certainly those directly or indirectly affected by a traumatic brain injury will benefit from reading her book, but so will anyone who believes its never too late to re-examine yourself and get to work making yourself a better person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;with a closed-head injury that left her in a coma for ten days, among &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;other injuries. She writes of the aftermath of her memoir, Lady In Red Where Is Your &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Head.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;- Blueink Review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;honesty sheds light on the harsh realities of &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;brain injuries and how a life can be forever changed.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;-Foreword Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Both sources provide information about her progress and also illustrate how much her friends and family loved &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;and cared for&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
