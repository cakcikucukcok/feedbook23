  <title>I&#39;m Hungry! or Am I? - Joanne M. Moff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joanne M. Moff, PA-C has been a practicing Physician Assistant for nine years.  She received her training at Kettering College of Medical Arts in Kettering, Ohio.  She has experience in both general and cardiothoracic surgery, and she recently changed her focus to bariatric surgery.  She currently works with Dr. Rita Anderson at Kettering Medical Center.
OkayIve Gone Through Weight Loss Surgery, Now What Do I Do?! is truly a labor of love.  This book actually evolved from a rather simple idea.  During employee orientation at Kettering Medical Center, new hires were encouraged to find ways in which to make a difference in their patients lives in whatever way they could  big or small.  The inspiration to find your pickle was introduced.  That began the process of seeking out some way to have an effect in bariatric patients lives.  Within the first couple of weeks after starting with Dr. Rita Anderson in bariatric surgery, a pickle was discovered.  Early recognition of the need for bariatric patients to have support following their surgery was made.  In order for the patients to achieve success in the short term with their weight loss as well as in the long term with maintenance of their weight loss and an overall healthier lifestyle, support was seen as necessary.  At first, simple ways to offer help were tossed around:  a calendar, a mug, or a water bottle with tips, pointers and reminders on it listing how to live the new lifestyle as a bariatric patient.  Then came the idea of a small booklet.  The booklet would be interactive, allowing bariatric patients to offer their own helpful hints and suggestions, and there would be input from healthcare providers as well.  As patients gave their contributions, research was being conducted and information was being gathered that would help to explain the whys of the new bariatric lifestyle as well as specific ways to incorporate those lifestyle changes.  The booklet grew, going from five sections into eight chapters.  It has continued to grow and expand into a full-fledged book covering the most important issues with which a bariatric patient will be faced.  The pickle that started out as a simple, sweet gherkin has turned into an elaborate, giant dill pickle.  What began as a way to help patients in the New Life Weight Loss Surgery Center succeed has turned into a crusade to help all patients who have gone through bariatric surgery succeed.  Bariatric patients have seen enough failure in their lives with failed diets and recurrent weight gain.  With the support of this book as well as support from family, friends, healthcare providers and other bariatric patients, failure will hopefully be a thing of the past." />
