  <title>The Emotionally Intelligent Leader - David. R. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a business executive who has investigated and implemented numerous initiatives to improve company performance isnt getting the results he wants, he tries something different.
He remembers reading an article about a leaderAndrew Miles
who credited his success to emotional intelligence. This intelligence, the article said, helped him engage his workforce and produce exceptional results.
It doesnt take the executive long to arrange a meeting with Miles, who tells him that business leaders must rely on physical, mental, and emotional effortwith emotional effort being how we manage our emotions to ensure we deliver high-quality results more frequently.
To cultivate emotional intelligence, Miles says, a leader must focus on six distinct competencies: emotional self-awareness, emotional awareness of others, authenticity, emotional reasoning, emotional self-management, and inspiring performance.
Miles explains that emotional intelligence underlies our self-awareness, empathy, leadership, and resilience, which are all skills fundamental to our success.
