  <title>Confessions of a Corporate Slut - Jacqueline Gum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;In CONFESSIONS OF A CORPORATE SLUT, Roberta conquers a bare-knuckle, male-dominated industry and achieves unparalleled success as an overachieving sales pro, entrepreneur, and corporate manager. But something is missing in her life. Marriage. Family. Purpose. When Roberta finds love, she is oblivious to the astronomical losses she will sustainincluding pride, self-esteem and moneythe tradeoff she makes to help her CEO husband push his manufacturing company to the pinnacle of its industry. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;When Roberta moves out of the family home at seventeen, her only working experience is a $1.35 gig at Dairy Queen. Unqualified and underage, she cajoles her way into managing a new restaurant and bar. Eventually she realizes the sales profession offers the best way to maximize her income, so she hits the road in hose and heels and a fifty-pound sample case of glassware, stir sticks, and beverage napkins. Little did she know her success would someday propel her into the unfamiliar role of the ideal corporate wife. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Roberta is the polar opposite of a victim as she faces each challenge with her trademark mixture of spunk and grace. Her wry sense of humor intertwines with conflict, weaving a tapestry rich in humor and irony. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Inspired by a true story CONFESSIONS OF A CORPORATE SLUT, is a tale of ambition and failurea tale of emotional connection and disconnection  of support and about-faces  of fear and loathingof love and hate. And a story that is all too often being played out in todays corporate culture. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
