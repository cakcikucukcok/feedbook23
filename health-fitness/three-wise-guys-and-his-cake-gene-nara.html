  <title>Three Wise Guys and “His Cake” - Gene Nara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its Christmas Eve, 1974, at the Nara household in Warren, Ohio. Gene and Maggie and their eight children are sitting in front of the fireplace waiting for their annual Christmas Eve tradition of singing happy birthday to Jesus and cutting the cake that was specially baked by Maggie in honor of Jesus birthday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a call from a student sends Gene on a trip to the high school where he is both a coach and a teacher. With his three daughters along for the ride, they see three young boys pulling on the front door of a drug store thats obviously closed. The girls ask Gene why the little kids are banging on the door. The Naras discover the boys are searching for wrapping paper for their Mom. Gene and the girls are happy to help, and thats where this Christmas story begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the familys true experience, &lt;em&gt;Three Wise Guys&lt;/em&gt; and His Cake narrates a story that shares how one family celebrated the birth of Jesus and how they spread His tremendous love to the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
