  <title>Poisoned!  What You Don’T Know About Heavy Metals Is Killing You! - Dr. Pamela J Owens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Pamela J. Owens newest book, Poisoned! What You Dont Know About Heavy Metals Is Killing You!, is a must read for all.  The health consequences from heavy metal toxicity are occurring at epidemic rates. 
The main threats to human health from heavy metals are associated with exposure to lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic and other less common metals. These metals have been extensively studied and their effects on human health thoroughly reviewed by international bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO).  Unknown to many, the effects of multiple heavy metal exposure, or synergistic effects are rarely evaluated by primary physicians. Scientists and researchers have joined forces and are letting the medical community know that heavy metals have serious and far-reaching consequences. 
Pervasive heavy metals have been found to disrupt the immune, nervous, and endocrine systems. As more people are exposed to these toxicants there continues to be increases in infertility, certain cancers, developmental delays, asthma, chemical sensitivities, and hormonal imbalances. Heavy metals have been implicated in causing and exacerbating many of these conditions. 
Every day millions of people are unknowingly exposed to heavy metals and unfortunately our bodies cannot metabolize and clear all of them. Chemicals not metabolized are stored in the fat cells throughout our bodies, where they continue to accumulate. As these chemicals build up they alter our metabolism, cause enzyme dysfunction and nutritional deficiencies, create hormonal imbalances, damage brain chemistry and can cause cancer. 
Dr. Owens new book is a detailed blueprint helping the patient and forward thinking healthcare professionals identify the specific heavy metal toxic burden and determine an effective and optimal treatment to decrease the toxic load." />
