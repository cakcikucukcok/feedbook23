  <title>The Family Bank - Dinaro Dinaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Children are not born with any particular knowledge or skills, therefore everything they need to know about how to survive in the real world they have to either learn at school or from you, their parents. Sadly, children dont learn vital financial lessons in school; therefore its up to you to teach them not just how to scrape by in life, but how to thrive! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Family Bank is a full home financial system, which will not only teach your children how to use a checking account, credit cards and loans; but how to: build a resume, prepare for a job interview, succeed at work on a daily basis, budget, and how to avoid getting into debt over their heads. Even what to do to get out of financial trouble if they do fall down that hole. The Family Bank will also teach your kids how credit works in our society and how to maximize their credit scores, in order to take advantage of all the benefits that come with good credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true beauty of The Family Bank though, is not the volumes of information it will help you to teach your kids; its the elegantly simple way it does it. The Family Bank is a simple, yet thorough and complete outline of everything you need to know in order to create an actual Family Bank in your home; where your children will be your bank members. To develop a Family Bank on your own would take you years, but who has the time? With The Family Bank and a few minutes of your time each week, your children will enter the real world armed with the knowledge they need in order to be financially successful, stable adults. Lets get started&lt;/p&gt;" />
