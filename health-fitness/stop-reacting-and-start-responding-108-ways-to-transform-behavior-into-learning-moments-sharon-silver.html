      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Do you react and yell when misbehavior you thought had been resolved shows up again?&amp;nbsp;Learn two parenting beliefs about misbehavior that cause you to think your toddler or child is disobeying you. See how your child truly views things so you can be calm and firm instead.&amp;nbsp;See pgs. 17 and 49.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Does fibbing, lying, or not owning up to something make you angry and create conflict?&amp;nbsp;Help ensure your child has the opportunity to be honest and take responsibility for his actions by handling lies using the method on pg. 19 during early childhood and the school-age years.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Do you feel disrespected when you hear an insincere &amp;ldquo;Sooorrrreeee?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;There is a unique and powerful way to apologize that creates a respectful &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry,&amp;rdquo; calms intense emotions, reconnects those involved, and truly makes amends. See pg. 65&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stop Reacting and Start Responding: 108 Ways to Transform Behavior into Learning Moments&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;illustrates&amp;nbsp;through examples from daily life&amp;nbsp;the unique partnership that exists between parent and child when correcting behavior. The book shares non-yelling yet firm&amp;nbsp;ways to respond instead of react to achieve better behavior from children ages 2-10.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Each tip the author includes acknowledges the long-range point of view regarding conflict resolution showing that how you address the intense emotions of early childhood and school-age children not only impacts your child now, it also determines whether or not your child becomes independent, respectful, responsible and capable of succeeding in the world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The book&amp;rsquo;s design is structured as a resource for parents; no chapter is longer than 2 pages and has a reference path to solutions at the end of the section to use&amp;nbsp;in the middle of misbehavior corrections.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Concepts are fine and good, but providing actual words we can use-That&amp;#39;s pure parenting gold. I highly recommend Stop Reacting and Start Responding.&amp;rdquo; -Teri Cettina, contributing editor, Parenting magazine&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sharon really does seem to see the entire relationship between parent and child in our interactions in a way that most authors and experts don&amp;#39;t. I think my entire parenting experience would have been easier if I&amp;#39;d known about her work when my older one was younger.&amp;quot; -Moxie, AskMoxie.org&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A glorious collection of parenting tips that moms can use to help them raise good and caring kids.&amp;rdquo; -Michele Borba, Ed.D., author of The Big Book of Parenting Solutions: 101 Answers to Your Everyday Challenges and Wildest Worries&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It can be difficult to navigate the differing opinions of experts in this digital age, but Sharon simplifies developmental concepts and provides parents with actionable advice to raise healthy, ethical, competent kids in a flash.&amp;rdquo;-Dr. Lynne Kenney, PsyD, Pediatric Psychologist author of The Family Coach Method&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
