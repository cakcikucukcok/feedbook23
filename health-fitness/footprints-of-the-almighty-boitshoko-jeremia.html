PALM SPRINGS, CALIFORNIA USA
&quot;Envision this setting while beginning your journey into Boitshoko Jeremia&#39;s second boko, Footprints of the Almighty. You&#39;ll be reading first hand, directly from the source, stories filled with bravery, vulnerability and hope. Use your mind to explore the communities that surround each adventure. Hear the voices behind each confession. Feel the emotions of every character. And soon you will become immersed in unbelievable adventures and entangled in a web of African culture.
Each new story is filled with spiritual adventures, astonishing admissions, and extraordinary journeys. Many of them would sound much more like fiction. If they weren&#39;t true. As you devour this book you&#39;ll feel the urge to read paragraphs out loud to anyone who will listen. I read full chapters to the woman doing my pedicure. In fact, I was so enthralled with this book that I stayed sitting in my chair long after my pedicure was done, and eventually had to be asked to leave the salon.&quot;
