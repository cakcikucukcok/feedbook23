  <title>You Love Your Daddy, Don&#39;t You?: A True Tragedy About Sexual Abuse - Sarah Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Mama, something terrible is wrong with me. There is blood in my panties!&quot; &lt;br&gt;Those were the words of seven-year-old Sarah. Mama told her she must have fallen or something and not to worry.  Sarah went away feeling sad; her chance for help was gone!  &lt;br&gt;It was Sarah&#39;s alter, Susie, who had been sticking pencils and other items in her private place. Susie had come when Sarah was only four years old. Susie had become Daddy&#39;s &#39;special&#39; little girl by sitting on his lap. In return he gave her a dollar for any change she had.  &lt;br&gt;Daddy played with Susie&#39;s pee pee and it was Susie that slept in the upstairs bedroom with her fourteen-year-old brother. Later in life, two other alters would appear.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Love Your Daddy, Don&#39;t You?&lt;/i&gt; is told through the memories of Sarah. It reveals a child&#39;s determination to survive despite profound emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. This was compounded by constant neglect from both parents.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sarah Harrison has written several articles for the Women&#39;s Institute for Incorporation Therapy&#39;s monthly newsletter as well as articles for spiritual magazines.  She also volunteers as a mentor in a local school system, helps with special group activities in an assisted living home, and provides guidance to troubled parents and teens on www.experts.com. &lt;br&gt;After the death of her husband, Sarah Harrison moved from Atlanta, Georgia in 2007 to a suburb near Charlotte, North Carolina to be near her grandchildren. She has joined Harrison United Methodist Church and is active in Youth Group, Emmaus, Epiphany, and Faith Partners." />
