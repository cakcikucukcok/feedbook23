She learned the value of her health the hard way, but she recovered and now feels healthier than ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to help herself through cancer treatment, Bernadette focused all her energy on getting informed about health. After meeting Dr Brian Clement from the Hippocrates Institute in Florida at a seminar, she decided to adopt the Hippocrates programme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firmly rooted in science, it is based on the principle that a nutrient-dense, primarily plant-based diet can lower the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer, and can help us to live longer, vibrant and energetic lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the programme changed Bernadette’s health for the better and she became passionate about sharing the benefits of her positive, healthy form of eating. She developed her own programme for diet and lifestyle change, which has helped thousands of people to get back to better health.
