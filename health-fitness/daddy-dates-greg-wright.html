  <title>Daddy Dates - Greg Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One day motivational leader Greg Wright realized that the four set of pretty young eyes under his own roof were looking to Dad to be strong, fearless, and wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality was, the lone male in an all-girl household (&quot;heck, even the dog was female&quot;) was only thirty years old and felt like he had been shoved into the deep end of the estrogen pool without swimming lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s when the love-struck father of four gorgeous pre-teens started searching for a plan for how to be a successful Dad, and did what any sensible guy would do. He bailed. Not only on his family, but into the woods, to seek a &quot;solution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy Dates&lt;/em&gt; is an entertaining and practical look at how one American father found his sea legs and is navigating through the tricky waters of parenting girls. In this game-changing book, Greg shares his easy-to-follow secrets for how married and single dads can go beyond high-fiving to bridge the gender gap and become the clued-in man who knows his daughter best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dads have more influence on their girls than anyone. &amp;nbsp;Learn what makes your daughter tick, how to talk to her effectively and connect more profoundly, at any age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If being their hero is your mission, it&#39;s not impossible. &lt;em&gt;Daddy Dates&lt;/em&gt; is your road map to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hi honey. It&#39;s Daddy. I&#39;m calling to see if you&#39;d like to go on a date with me tonight.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Um, yes, Daddy I think I would.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a phone call Greg Wright has made over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By age thirty, Greg was the overwhelmed father of four beautiful little girls, with one thought running through his mind over and over again: Don&#39;t Screw Up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy Dates&lt;/em&gt; is about a guy taking his best shot at being a successful dad by trying to know his girls?really know their fears, dreams, and opinions?and how he stumbled across an incredible strategy to do that with daughters of any age or stage. This funny, insightful, and relatable book poses the wildly original concept that should be a &quot;duh&quot; for most dads?but isn&#39;t. In order to raise a confident woman-to-be, show your daughter what it feels like to be treated with love, respect, and true interest by a man who loves her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy Dates&lt;/em&gt; is not another &quot;how to&quot; book from a parenting expert.&amp;nbsp;It&#39;s a personal, eye-opening, often humorous look at an Average Joe&#39;s intentional pursuit of his daughter&#39;s hearts and minds, and the love-inspired steps he is taking to solidify Dad&#39;s place in each of their lives, forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether married or single, &lt;em&gt;Daddy Dates&lt;/em&gt; can help you better connect with virtually all of the females in your life. Using Greg&#39;s communication cues, you&#39;ll be blown away by what you&#39;ll learn about your child, and how you can make a powerful, lasting difference?especially during her rocky teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daddy Dates&lt;/em&gt; is about one thing?becoming her hero?one date at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
