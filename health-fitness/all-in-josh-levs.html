  <title>All In - Josh Levs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When journalist Josh Levs was denied fair parental leave by his employer after his child was born, he fought back&amp;#8212;and won. Since then, he&amp;#8217;s become an advocate for modern families and working fathers. In &lt;em&gt;All In&lt;/em&gt;, he explores the changing face of fatherhood and what it means for our individual lives, families, workplaces, and society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fatherhood today is far different from previous generations. Stay-at-home dads are increasingly common, and growing numbers of men are working part-time or flextime schedules to spend more time with their children.&amp;#160; Even the traditional breadwinner-dad is being transformed. Dads today are more emotionally and physically involved on the home front. They are &amp;#8220;all in&amp;#8221; and&amp;#8212;like mothers&amp;#8212;they are struggling with work-life balance and doing it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalist and &amp;#8220;dad columnist&amp;#8221; Josh Levs explains that despite these unprecedented changes, our laws, corporate policies, and gender-based expectations in the workplace remain rigid. They are preventing both women and men from living out the equality we believe in&amp;#8212;and hurting businesses in the process. Women have done a great job of speaking out about this, Levs&amp;#8212;whose fight for parental leave made front page news across the country&amp;#8212;argues. It&amp;#8217;s now time for men to join in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining Levs&amp;#8217; personal experiences with investigative reporting and frank conversations with fathers about everything from work life to money to sex, &lt;em&gt;All In&lt;/em&gt; busts popular myths, lays out facts, uncovers the forces holding all of us back, and shows how we can all join together to change them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
