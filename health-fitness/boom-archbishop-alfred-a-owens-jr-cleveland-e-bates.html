  <title>Boom! - Archbishop Alfred A. Owens Jr., Cleveland E. Bates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God has blessed us all with extraordinary potential; however, only a few of us will realize this great blessing. Why? We settle for just survival, just enough, or living mediocre lives. Many times we allow the detours, trials, obstacles, and struggles encountered to sway us away from Gods promises and our predestined greatness. Hard times and discouragement can cause us to take a back seat posture and watch life go by. However, we were not created to take a rest on the path of mediocrity. We were created to experience BOOM! We are all made in Gods image to do great works and the life He gave us to the fullest. Yet, when the gale strength winds begin to blow, we run for cover instead of standing on Gods Word. The BOOM will not happen for us if we are unwilling to take risks regardless to how bleak our individual situations seem.
Ever wondered what it would take to get you out of the monotonous lane of life? Do you have unfulfilled dreams and visions that live in the graveyard of procrastination? When you take a moment to view life in hindsight, are you dissatisfied with where you are? Do you want to know what it would take to move you from failure to success? Do you wish to step away from the ordinary and embrace the gusto of life? Do  you want to move away from the crowd and began to live life as it was meant to be? Have you allowed yourself to get stuck in complacency, stagnation, vision myopia, despair or fear? If your response to any of the questions is a resounding yes, then BOOM is the book for you.
This book is God-inspired to help you move from the isolated, mundane, pits of despair to a place where dreams, visions and goals come to pass. Dont let the BOOM past you by, for BOOM is not a moment, its a movement." />
