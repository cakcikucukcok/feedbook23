  <title>The Book of Old - Nancy Knudsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nancy Knudsen never knew what to expect as she and her husband got older: She had to find out the hard way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But navigating the aging process shouldnt be a mystery, which is why she wrote this insightful, enlightening, and entertaining guide on what it really means to turn forty, fifty, sixty, and onward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll get your chance to share in the delights of aging in your own good timeunless, of course, youre dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you progress from age forty to forty-five, youll find that you need a few minutes to relax when you get home from work before taking that walk or lifting those weights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many men will start looking back, and instead of seeing accomplishments, theyll see what they havent done, which is the male version of menopause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women can expect mood swings, hot flashes at the worst times, night sweats, sleep disruptions, and the slow but inevitable waning of a certain monthly visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter how old you are now, youll be equipped to make smart decisions and find comfort in knowing that youre not alone with the humorous insights and practical advice in The Book of Old.&lt;/p&gt;" />
