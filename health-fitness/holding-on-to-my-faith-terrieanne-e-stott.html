  <title>Holding on to My Faith - Terrieanne E. Stott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faith can be the cornerstone of ones strength. While some may believe having faith means their lives will be free of conflict and loss, in reality, the opposite is often true.
Holding on to My Faith: Memoirs of an Unbroken Spirit is the story of author Terrieanne E. Stotts medical, physical, mental, and spiritual struggles that resulted from the many autoimmune diseases she has. Shes coped with varied facets of her various illnesses, has been hospitalized on numerous occasions, and endured unbelievable pain. Stott has also been the victim of severe verbal, physical, and mental abuse stemming from her multiple failed marriages. Her life would be a trial for most of us.
But despite her circumstances, Stotts faith has never waivered. It has resulted in, among other things, two children who have become successful adults. Although Holding on to My Faith: Memoirs of an Unbroken Spirit depicts many difficult, even terrible situations, it is a story of victory and an unbroken spirit. Youll see how even though faith will not stop bad things from happening, it will show you how to get through those situations and thrive." />
