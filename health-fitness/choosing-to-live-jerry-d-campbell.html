      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jerry D. Campbell met his co-worker Veta, there was a policy that forbade employees from dating each other. Of course, they broke it  and ended up being sweethearts for forty-seven years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when Veta died in April 2010, she left behind a husband devastated by grief. By forcing himself to work through it, he was able to deal with his loss while still enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youre dealing with the death of a loved one, you cant run away from it. In this guidebook to working through loss, youll learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; develop a grief calendar that will help you cope with loss;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; maintain a positive attitude as you work through new challenges;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; continue to go about daily life even though you may be alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youll also learn about the five stages of grief identified by Elisabeth Kbler-Ross and why the author thinks its necessary to get to a sixth stage  one he identifies as growth. &lt;/p&gt;
