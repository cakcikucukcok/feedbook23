  <title>The Five Minute Positive Focus Daily Journal - Sandra Selby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is it that you want? &lt;br /&gt;
More financial serenity, healthy relationships, excitement, travel? &lt;br /&gt;
What you think about is &lt;br /&gt;
what you get more of. &lt;br /&gt;
Wouldnt you like it to be &lt;br /&gt;
more of what you want?&lt;br /&gt;
With just five minutes a day, you will learn to focus consistently on your hearts desires. &lt;br /&gt;
Then, sit back and watch as your desires and dreams turn into possibilities and realities with the Positive Focus Journal!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After just one month of journaling, doors began to open in ways I previously couldnt imagine. Energy moved through home renovation projects that &lt;br /&gt;
had been stuck in the mud for a year. I found the right and perfect people to guide me through painting and home repairs at a reasonable price. So many things got checked off my to-do list that I manifested a trip to Sedona! Id recommend this system to anyone whos ready to engage in a &lt;br /&gt;
powerful manifestation process the Positive Focus way. &lt;br /&gt;
