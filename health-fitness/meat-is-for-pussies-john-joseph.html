  <title>Meat Is for Pussies - John Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Joseph wants men to know, in no uncertain terms, that they don&amp;#8217;t need to eat steak, burgers, wings, ribs, or any other animal product, for that matter, to be strong&amp;#8212;in fact, he would argue, eating animals is for the weak. Because when your protein sources come from animals, you&amp;#8217;re missing out on all of the nutritional benefits of a plant-based diet&amp;#8212;a diet that can make you more fit, more sexy, and more manly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Meat is for Pussies&lt;/em&gt;, Joseph presents a throw-down of information, offering both personal and scientific evidence that a plant-based diet offers the best path to athleticism, endurance, strength, and overall health. In addition to handily dispelling the myths surrounding meat, Joseph offers workout advice, a meal plan, and recipes that make going plant-based easy. Flavor and vitamin-packed options like the Working Man Stew and Veggie Chili with Cornbread will keep men&amp;#8217;s (and women&amp;#8217;s) bodies healthy and energized, while workouts that emphasize cardio and strength training build endurance and stamina and prove that you don&amp;#8217;t need meat to build muscle.&amp;#8232;&amp;#8232;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joseph also offers living proof that living a plant-based lifestyle is badass, from super-athlete Brendan Brazier to MMA champion Jake Shields to Joseph himself, who is an Ironman Triathlete and still rocking out (at the age of fifty-two) on world tours as the frontman for his legendary band the Cro-Mags. Joseph&amp;#8217;s passion for educating the world about the benefits of a plant-based diet comes through on each page, in a voice and a vocabulary that is uniquely his own. At the end of the day, he wants readers to live a long, healthy, happy life . . . and he won&amp;#8217;t take no for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
