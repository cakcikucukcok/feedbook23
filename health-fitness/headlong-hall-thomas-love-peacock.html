  <title>Headlong Hall - Thomas Love Peacock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thomas Love Peacock considered his novels to be &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;comic romances&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;rdquo; &amp;quot;Headlong Hall&amp;quot;, published in 1816, the first of his seven novels, already sets the pattern for his other novels of talk: characters seated at table, eating and drinking, and embarking on learned and philosophical discussions in which many common opinions of the day are criticised.&lt;br /&gt;

The novel features a country-house, the titular Headlong Hall, populated by a diverse set of characters, each embodying a particular intellectual obsession and each tirelessly advocating his or her ideas in the frequent debates on which the novel turns &amp;ndash; debates that are often learned, sometimes absurd, but always spirited. Plot is rudimentary, frequently depending on slapstick relieved by a love interest or two, with marriage providing a comic resolution. While highly eclectic intellectually, the typical Peacock novel is unified by some idea that runs through the novel&amp;#39;s debates." />
