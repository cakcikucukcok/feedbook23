  <title>Fight Like a Girl...and Win - Lori Hartman Gervasi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A kick-ass practical guide that packs a major punch ... without even throwing one! Self-defense lecturer and no-nonsense blonde bombshell Lori Gervasi lays out simple actions and important decisions women must make BEFORE they find themselves in physical danger to eliminate surprise and panic.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s an unfortunate reality that women are susceptible to random acts of aggression, from sexual harassment and stalking to physical assaults, domestic violence, date rape and worse.  But women &lt;i&gt;can&lt;/i&gt; learn how to protect and defend themselves -- with this groundbreaking guidebook.  Let martial arts black belt and accomplished journalist Lori Hartman Gervasi walk you through easy-to-follow, everyday steps for taking charge of your personal safety, training your reflexes, and -- if and when the time comes -- using force.  Her program consists of 26 potentially life-saving decisions that every woman must make, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DECIDE TO BELIEVE IN YOUR FIGHT&lt;/b&gt; - Battles are waged from the inside out.  Your conscience, intelligence, and guts must be committed to the cause.  You and those you love are the things worth fighting for. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DECIDE TO DEVISE A STRATEGY&lt;/b&gt; - Create a one-way ticket out of every imaginable circumstance, from back-door escape routes to getaways in public places.  Think &quot;what-if...?&quot;, plan for the unexpected, and be ready for anything! &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DECIDE TO RECOGNIZE THE THREAT OF THE INITIAL ATTACK&lt;/b&gt; - When practicing awareness, you can detect danger &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; it happens.  The bad guy will take steps to get close to you.  Watch carefully and identify these for what they are--the preludes to an attack. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DECIDE TO MOVE&lt;/b&gt; - If an attacker strikes, don&#39;t freeze--get moving!  Break through your fear with instant mobility.  You have limitless options and any movement works as long as it leads to your safety. &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;DECIDE TO &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;ACT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;ON&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; YOUR INSTINCTS&lt;/b&gt; - Your intuition is your guide, but you must respond physically in order to be successful.  When something isn&#39;t right, take action, change plans, redirect yourself, and control your destiny! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...along with Defense Do&#39;s And Don&#39;ts, inspiring &quot;Power Points,&quot; and other survival tactics that can help you to be prepared, stay strong, and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;                                    FIGHT LIKE A GIRL...AND WIN &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
