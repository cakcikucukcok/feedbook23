  <title>Raising Healthy Parents - Sid Garza-Hillman, Matt Frazier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;This ain’t your parents’ parenting book&lt;i&gt;. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In parenting, there is a case to be made for putting your oxygen mask on first. This refreshingly humorous yet effective guide on the oh-so-serious business of parenting reminds us that being a successful parent means first being a successful human. Part philosophy, part implementation—including recipes, tips, and exercises—Sid Garza-Hillman’s damn-is-it-tough-to-stay-happy-and-healthy-these-days resource is a must-have for anyone who is or will be a parent. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the complicated, fast-paced world of raising children, it is easy to forget that a family is really the sum of its parts. In &lt;i&gt;Raising Healthy Parents: Small Steps, Less Stress, and a Thriving Family&lt;i&gt;, Sid Garza-Hillman expounds on his premise that health and happiness, like the body and mind, are inextricably linked. And while this book is essentially about perfecting the imperfect art of parenting, Garza-Hillman puts the focus squarely on the individual. Equal parts philosophy and reality, this edgy and humorous guide to parenting offers simple, life-altering steps that will bring wellness and harmony to the parent, and, as a result, the whole family . &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Raising Healthy Parents&lt;i&gt; contains easy-to-do tasks, lessons, resources and simple recipes, but it is much more than a simple to-do list. As parents explore themselves, their forgotten dreams, their abandoned passions, Garza-Hillman will show them that easing into healthy choices will benefit them, their spouses, and most important, their children. And because there is no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting, the specific needs and motivations of each family dictate the size and frequency of Garza-Hillman’s Small Steps. This book provides the basic principles on how to live your best life and make happiness, low stress, low conflict, and fun the starting point for a life-long endeavor." />
