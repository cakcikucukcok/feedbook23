  <title>Tell Me the Number before Infinity: The Story of a Girl with a Quirky Mind, an Eccentric Family, and Oh Yes, a Disability - Becky Taylor, Dena Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Tell Me the Number before Infinity, The Story of a Girl with a Quirky Mind, an Eccentric Family, and Oh Yes, a Disability&amp;quot; &lt;/em&gt;is a&amp;nbsp;memoir in 60 short chapters arranged chronologically by Becky Taylor, who was born with cerebral palsy, and by her mother, Dena Taylor. Dena writes of Becky&amp;#39;s birth&amp;nbsp;in 1972, discovering Becky&amp;#39;s exceptional gift for calculus and depth of thought even at the age of four. Together they write about her school years and college to adulthood, in counterpoint, from their own distinct perspectives. Although several books on disabilities already exist, the use of two narrations is unique.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TELL ME THE NUMBER BEFORE INFINITY&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is a hero&amp;#39;s journey with Becky Taylor at the forefront of the pivotal 1975 federal education act mainstreaming disabled children into the public schools. Parents, teachers, people with disabilities, people who know and work with people with disabilities, those curious about how a child&amp;#39;s mind works, and even brain researchers will find&lt;em&gt;TELL ME THE NUMBER BEFORE INFINITY&lt;/em&gt; a fascinating account as the authors describe life and the realities of having a disability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Becky Taylor has a degree in accounting, and is a Computer Science graduate from the University of California, Santa Cruz. She lives in Santa Cruz where she vice-chairs the Commission on Disabilities, and is involved in other civic organizations. Dena Taylor, M.S.W., Rutgers University, is the mother of two grown daughters, and is retired from careers in social work and education. She is the author, editor and co-editor of six books on women&amp;#39;s issues.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Included are photos and newspaper clippings from throughout Becky&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I learned so much about human nature reading this book that I forgot to worry about the disability of one co-author and the enormous frustrations of the other. It&amp;rsquo;s not that this exceptional mother-and-daughter team glosses anything over; they face all of it like warriors, with ingenuity and courage, and we learn a great deal from that, too. Rather it&amp;rsquo;s their focus on the power within that struck me to the core. It&amp;rsquo;s hearing myself laughing out loud at their beautiful sense of humor. It&amp;rsquo;s understanding through them that the strength it takes to face life head on can inspire readers like me, who feel genuinely renewed at book&amp;rsquo;s end.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;Patricia Holt, former book review editor, &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
