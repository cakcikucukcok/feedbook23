  <title>30 - Natalie Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is constantly in motion. With each birthday we celebrate, we have made a full trip around the sun. Each moment that passes, leaves us, ever so slightly, different. Every breath we take is new...
This book is a collection of stories, of modern day fables, that just happen to be true.  
These stories are the highlight reel of a well-examined life, and told from the voice of a still evolving thirty-year-old woman, who is living her life, and her dreams, one day at a time.
The inspiration for this book, came from my remarkable 75 year-old grandmother Georgette, who recently honored my family by writing her memoirs.  So, I thought, perhaps you are never too old, or too young, to have a story to tell.
May these stories bring you laughter and tears, as you follow my journey through the tough and tangled world of growing up, falling down, finding love and losing it.  A student of life, taking the road less traveled, and sometimes taking no road at all, but always, standing at the fork in the road and enjoying the view.
May the heart of these stories strike a chord in your own.
Much love, Natalie" />
