  <title>Footnotes - Sarah Mulkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After more than forty years of working outside the home, this newly retired grandmother expands her horizons by becoming the daily caregive for her infant grandson, a career opportunity that was never listed among her lofty professional goals but one that proves to offer valuable continuing education on what matters most in life.
&quot;These lessons are just that--age-old wisdom in the form of little &quot;aha&#39;s&quot; that slip in and out of my moments with Sawyer. From this vantage point, I have the priceless pleasure of watching this little life unfold, with the experience and awareness that older age affords me.&quot;
--From the book
