  <title>Joy in Life - Alex Tumparov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Alex Tumparov has learned from a lifetime of studying, teaching, and applying the principles of &lt;em&gt;Joy in Life&lt;/em&gt; that they will dramatically change and drastically transform your life. You can make real progress, regardless of your current state or condition. &lt;em&gt;Joy in Life&lt;/em&gt; is designed to give you the courage to begin your journey and also encourage you every step of the way. It will give you strength for today, hope for tomorrow, and a bright promise for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite any obstacles that come your way, you must recognize that it is not the world or your circumstances that need to change; real change must begin with you. No goal is easy, whether it is climbing to the top of a mountain, becoming chairman of the board, or achieving an ideal weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is a journey, and &lt;em&gt;Joy in Life&lt;/em&gt; promises to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
get you started in the right direction;
keep you on the path you need to go;
lead you to your destination.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must realize that God has a perfect plan and purpose for your life; nothing He does is by accident. You too can begin looking at the big picture that can only be seen through the eyes of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take these simple steps and follow the leadership of God to the best of your ability, He will absolutely lead and guide you. Today you can begin the journey that will take you far beyond the limits of human comprehension, for He truly is your guide to genuine joy and true happiness and much &lt;em&gt;Joy in Life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
