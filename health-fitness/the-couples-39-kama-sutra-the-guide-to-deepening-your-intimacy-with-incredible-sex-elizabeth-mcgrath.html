  <title>The Couples&#39; Kama Sutra: The Guide to Deepening Your Intimacy with Incredible Sex - Elizabeth McGrath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt; offers a timeless structure for experimenting with sex. &lt;em&gt;The Couples&#39; Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt; goes one step further by empowering you to love your own body and in doing so unlock new passions to have the kind of sex that makes you feel the way you want to feel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sex is fun. It feels good and brings us closer together. But for many of us, the sex we&#39;re having doesn&#39;t deliver the excitement it used to, it doesn&#39;t connect us to one another like we want or need it to. We try to &quot;spice things up&quot; with new positions but still don&#39;t feel the kind of intimacy we seek. Discovering the connection that&#39;s missing isn&#39;t as simple as just contorting your body differently-it&#39;s an inside job as well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt; is the oldest guide to erotic love. Among its many groundbreaking features, the &lt;em&gt;Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt; suggests that sex is intended for pleasure. For more than a decade, sex therapist Elizabeth McGrath has combined the &lt;em&gt;Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s lessons about sexual pleasure and human connection with the latest research in Somatic Sex Therapy, which focuses on bringing intense physical awareness into your body. Elizabeth&#39;s private counseling has re-energized the sex lives of more than a thousand clients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Couples&#39; Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt; is a contemporary approach to sex deeply rooted in the foundation of the &lt;em&gt;Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt;. In this book you&#39;ll explore a wide array of sexual possibilities through intensely erotic sex positions that will help you delve into the deepest layers of your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;41 beautifully illustrated sex positions reveal the five most desired modes of &lt;em&gt;Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt; based sex: Intimate, Powerful, Energetic, Racy, Playful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Suggestions for communicating your desires openly, and acting on them with confidence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Simple exercises combine the essence of the &lt;em&gt;Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt; with the latest research in sexuality to heighten your sexual pleasure through erotic talk, touch, and teasing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Supportive, direct guidance for introducing new pleasures, such as sex toys, bondage, and role-play&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Couples&#39; Kama Sutra&lt;/em&gt; will introduce you to sexual experimentation, show you how to create a lasting connection, and help you lay the foundation for incredible, true-to-you sex that deepens and fulfills your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
