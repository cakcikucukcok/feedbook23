      <meta name="description" content="A MOTHERS LOVE
NOTED BY LISA SANDOVAL
I was a little girl at grandmas kitchen table eating a snack with her and my mom.  I was about 4 years old.  My mom turned to me and said, I am not your real mommy. I looked up at her and she said, Did you know that?   I shook my head  NO.   Yes baby, your real mommy couldnt take care of you, so she gave you to me.  She didnt have any food or clothes for you.  She was just a little kid herself.  She had no one to take care of her.  She was only 16 years old and not in this country legally.  Your mommy wanted you to be happy and not be hungry or scared.  You were adopted by us.  I remember shrugging my shoulders, said OH, OK and continued eating my snack.  Needless to say I am happy and blessed.  I have been asked over and over if I have ever wanted find my birth mother, and no, I dont have a strong hunger to seek her out.  I am complete in every way. Seems to me she made a very wise and grown up choice. I have no bitterness whatsoever,  in fact I am proud of her courageous decision. She showed her maturity and thought of her babys future. God Bless Her." />
