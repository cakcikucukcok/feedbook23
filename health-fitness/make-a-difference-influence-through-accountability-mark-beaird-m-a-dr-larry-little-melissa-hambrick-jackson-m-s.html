  <title>Make a Difference: Influence Through Accountability - Mark Beaird M.A., Dr. Larry Little, Melissa Hambrick Jackson M.S.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Becoming a leader who can be respected both on and off the field of competition will pay dividends in ones future professional and personal pursuits. However, this is not a journey that can be taken lightly, but requires a commitment to understanding responsibility and answerability for ones life and actions. We are all accountable to someone, but it is how we respond to that accountability that sets us apart as either a leader or a follower. I realize the idea of leadership may not appeal to, or be the goal of all who read this book; but make no mistake about it, everyone will lead someone in his or her life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As you read this book you will be challenged to understand and accept accountability for yourself and your actions on a new level. Nevertheless, this is not merely an attempt to encourage responsible behavior or to lecture the reader on moral or ethical behavior. It is about personal growth and achieving ones ultimate potential regardless of ones aspirations in life. The need to be accountable is pervasive in all areas of our lives. We are challenged to be accountable to people in our lives, obligations we have made, dreams and goals we have set, challenges we have accepted, and the standards we have set for ourselves.&lt;/P&gt;" />
