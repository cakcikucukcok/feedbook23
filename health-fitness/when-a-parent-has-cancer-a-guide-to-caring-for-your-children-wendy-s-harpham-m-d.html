  <title>When a Parent Has Cancer: A Guide to Caring for Your Children - Wendy S. Harpham, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At some point in our lives, many of us will face the crisis of an unexpected illness. For parents, the fear, anxiety and confusion resulting from a cancer diagnosis can be particularly devastating. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;When A Parent Has Cancer&lt;/em&gt; is a book for families written from the heart of experience. A mother, physician, and cancer survivor, Dr Wendy Harpham offers clear, direct, and sympathetic advice for parents challenged with the task of raising normal, healthy children while they struggle with a potentially life&amp;#8211;threatening disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dr Harpham lays the groundwork of her book with specific plans for helping children through the upheaval of a parent&#39;s diagnosis and treatment, remission and recovery, and if necessary, confronting the possibility of death. She emphasises the importance of being honest with children about the gravity of the illness, while assuring them that their basic needs will always be met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Included is &lt;em&gt;Becky and the Worry Cup&lt;/em&gt;, an illustrated children&#39;s book that tells the story of a seven&amp;#8211;year&amp;#8211;old girl&#39;s experiences with her mother&#39;s cancer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
