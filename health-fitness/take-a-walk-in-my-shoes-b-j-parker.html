  <title>Take a Walk in My Shoes - B. J. Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once a taboo subject, victims of rape and molestation were left without a voice with nowhere to turn and no one to help them. In &lt;i&gt;Take a Walk in My Shoes&lt;/i&gt;, author B. J. Parker shares her personal story of being raped and molested by her stepfather at a young age. She exposes the controversial topic of molestation, its long-term adverse effects on interpersonal relationships, its role in promoting self-destructive behaviors, and the need to find control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this inspirational memoir, Parker, now fifty-three years old, comes to terms with her early abuse and tells about taking the crucial steps needed to find her way back. &lt;i&gt;Take a Walk in My Shoes&lt;/i&gt; narrates Parkers story and how she adopted a life of alcohol and drugs to ease the constant emotional pain and how she chose to be homeless rather than live in a dwelling that had everything, including her abuser. Her story follows her journey through childhood and as a runaway teenager, a high school dropout, and a single mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Take a Walk in My Shoes&lt;/i&gt; tells how she overcame the stigma of abuse by sharing the message that successes are possible for each and every victim. Parker explains how to embrace life, believe in yourself, dig deep within your soul, and hold tight to your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
