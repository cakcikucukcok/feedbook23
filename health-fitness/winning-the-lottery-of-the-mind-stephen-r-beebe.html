  <title>Winning the Lottery of the Mind - Stephen R. Beebe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is meant to be a quick read. It is designed to deliver for people who have hit their bottom, or whose lives have been challenged to the point at which they are no longer willing to see it going further down, and enable them to take the lessons taught within and apply those lessons the next day. In the new push to stir up creativity and innovation and to stimulate small business, there could not be a better time for this simple and to the point text.
       You will deal with critical thinking, and defining your passion (that one thing within you that when you are doing it makes you happy beyond anything else- in essence your calling), making a life decision, planning for your success in your passion, and building a support structure. Then we will deal with something that seems to be most difficult in this process, and that is being honest and fair-handed with you. So many people think too highly of themselves, or they do not highly enough of themselves. In the Honest self appraisal, you will have to be completely honest with yourself to optimize your results.
       This book is a program, not cast in stone, but a source of direction in whatever you choose to do, no matter your station in life, to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, start all over again, and be successful at it; whatever it is that you have defined that you were born to do. Who could ask for more that this at any price?" />
