  <title>The Fruit of the Tree -  Edith Wharton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Fruit of the Tree&amp;quot; is one of Edith Wharton&amp;#39;s few novels to deal directly with issues such as euthanasia, the problems of labour and industrial conditions, and professions for women, as well as Wharton&amp;#39;s more customary themes such as divorce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Published in 1907, it received positive but mixed reviews, and more recently critics have attempted to explain its uneven structure, which combines an industrial plot (Amherst&amp;#39;s attempts to reform the mills), an ethical plot (the question of euthanasia) and the more conventional romance plot.&lt;br /&gt;
It is also true his little known novel by the author of &amp;quot;The Age of Innocence&amp;quot; was also considered very controversial for its frank treatment of the above mentioned social issues.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Fruit of the Tree&amp;quot; is a conventionally structured novel hinging upon a love triangle with the principle male character, John Amherst providing the hinge between two different female leads, Bessy Langhope, a mill owner, and Justine Brent, a nurse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;quot;The Fruit of the Tree&amp;quot;, Wharton created a gripping tale full of psychological insights, deft social portraiture, and profound ethical questions that remain challenging even today." />
