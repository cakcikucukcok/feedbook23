  <title>Flurries - D.G. Mago</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Due to a snowstorm, school has been cancelled. Instead of playing in the snow all day like most kids, a group of teenagers decide to go to a wealthy neighborhood to shovel driveways and earn some money. In the course of their day away, they are filled with envy in seeing the expensive houses, fancy cars, and latest gadgets. What they do not see, however, is what is taking place inside some of those homes; the same virus that plagues the inner city is not immune to the community outside of the ghetto. Like roaches hidden in the wall, there are some things that lurk under the surface. Moreover, some people are master illusionists, hiding what is behind the front door:  domestic abuse, pedophilia, agoraphobia, drug addiction, and isolation. Ghettos indeed come in many different forms.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;These teenagers live in a housing project in the Bronx. They have little money and few materialistic things, however, what they do have is of far greater value. They are all given love and affection, attention, and a strong sense of values by whoever is raising them, be it their mother, grandparents, sister, etc.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flurries&lt;/i&gt; is an examination of two different worlds:  not the traditional haves and the have nots, but those who have the social and emotional skills to lead a healthy and productive life, and those who solely have materialistic things, but lack what is really necessary to raise their children. The grass may be greener on the other side, but are the roots deeper or stronger? Flurries will challenge you to question what society and the media have brainwashed us into believing.  That bigger is better, more is the answer, and value is based on the almighty dollar. Flurries will assist you to understand that these teenagers are the wealthiest ones of all, even if at the moment they do not yet realize it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
