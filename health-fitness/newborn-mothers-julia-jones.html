  <title>Newborn Mothers - Julia Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The last thing Newborn Mothers need is another book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endless experts and advice undermine your intuition and confidence. Information overload doesn&amp;rsquo;t help when you feel isolated, exhausted and overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you really need is a hot cup of tea, a good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep and a laundry fairy. (Sadly, these things can&amp;rsquo;t fit inside a book!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Newborn Mothers is about doing less, not more. It answers your real questions about the transformation to motherhood including...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash; Is baby brain real? Are you actually losing your mind?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; You heard it takes a village to raise a child, but what does that look like in the 21st century? And how do you build yours?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; You were told these are the best days of your life. Are you the only one finding it this hard?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You planned for the birth, then realised those books and classes did nothing to prepare you for the rest of your life as a mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you are pregnant for the first time or your babies are growing up too fast, this book is your invitation to join a gentle, internal revolution in your heart and in your home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a sanctuary for your birth as a mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free audiobook edition included!&lt;/p&gt;" />
