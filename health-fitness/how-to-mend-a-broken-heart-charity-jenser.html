  <title>How to Mend a Broken Heart - Charity Jenser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells you exactly what to do to get over your ex faster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think a lot of people have had their fair share of separations. There is only a handful of people who have had only one relationship or none at all. Every time it is over, it hits us hard. What happens in our brains after the relationship is over? What should we do? What are the best ways to get your life on track and to remove feelings of sadness and pain? In this book, you will find answers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Topics like the following will be addressed:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The stages of grief over the damage caused by losing a loved one&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Coping tactics and minor tips to grow and overcome moods of despair or sorrow&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Seven proven steps to heal your broken heart, elaborately explained&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to get rid of old recollections and promptly create new ones&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Numerous ways you can find help among friends, family, and experts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Important lessons we can all learn from having a broken heart&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why crying or getting angry is okay and how long to do it&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Affirmations, morning routines, and workouts&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The best ways to keep yourself busy, distracted, and engaged with others&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to search for your inner creativity and improve your positive outlook on life&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Actual ways to see the best in yourself and comprehend that everything happens for a reason&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Healthy ways and activities to explore&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Specific questions answered about what to do with your time, when you bump into your ex, or find yourself talking about him or her&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The reason why you should allow yourself to feel real heartache and why it is actually a good thing&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The reasoning behind the &amp;ldquo;avoid social media&amp;rdquo; rule&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What not to do when you break up with your partner&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to grow productivity, health, and creativity with the new time you have&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Benefits and gains you will have after a breakup&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ideas to spoil yourself when you need a little light at the end of the tunnel&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How meditation, finding your &amp;ldquo;Zen&amp;rdquo;, and other spiritual aspects can ease your mind and get you back on track&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Curious? Then don&amp;rsquo;t wait, and start listening, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to remain in the dark. Save yourself the misery of common mistakes, and learn from what I have learned. I will see you in the first chapter!" />
