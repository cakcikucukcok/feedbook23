  <title>Book of Questions for Teens - LaDonna Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is comprised of inviting and intriguing questions that result from peer pressure, morality, bizarre circumstances and everyday situations that teens go through.
I have used questions similar to these in the classroom as a psychology teacher and in-group and individual counseling sessions to generate thoughts, evaluate decision-making skills and to use as a guide to understanding teenager issues.  I found the book to be very successful with helping students to talk about issues that they were experiencing.
My professional background includes working as an Adolescent and Child Psychologist, Career Counselor and for the last seven years, I have worked in the public school system as a Psychology Teacher and School Counselor, which afforded me the opportunity to become knowledgeable of the issues that teenagers go through.  From the above experience, I have designed questions that teens find humorous, authentic, and informative.  Although the title of the book reads for teenager, I am quite confident that teachers, counselors, and parents would benefit from the book as well." />
