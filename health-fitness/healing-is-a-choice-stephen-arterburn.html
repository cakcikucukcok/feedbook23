  <title>Healing Is a Choice - Stephen Arterburn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO YOU WANT TO GET WELL?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power to heal—physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually—is in God’s hands.&amp;nbsp;But the choice to be healed is yours. Everyone, at some level, needs healing. You may&amp;nbsp;have prayed for healing many times, for many years. Perhaps you have lived with your&amp;nbsp;brokenness so long that you have become accustomed to it. Maybe you wonder just&amp;nbsp;when God is going to take all the hurt away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He can. But you also must choose to let the hurt go and let the healing begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this special edition of &lt;i&gt;Healing Is a Choice&lt;/i&gt;, author Stephen Arterburn offers a unique&amp;nbsp;combination of book and workbook, outlining ten choices crucial to receiving healing.&amp;nbsp;Embracing these choices means rejecting the lies we often tell ourselves. These are not&amp;nbsp;hoops God requires you to jump through to earn your miracle; they form, instead, the&amp;nbsp;journey He desires for you. He can—and will—walk with you. But you must put one&amp;nbsp;foot in front of the other and choose to let the hurt go and let the healing begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“His Word affirms that God wants us to experience His healing, but many times&amp;nbsp;we make choices that stand in the way. &lt;i&gt;Healing Is a Choice&lt;/i&gt; is a helpful resource that&amp;nbsp;lays out the path of healing God’s way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— JACK HAYFORD Founding pastor, The Church on the Way, Van Nuys, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When we look back at the past turns and twists in the pathways of our lives, we&amp;nbsp;can see significant choices we made, which helped create the lives we have now.&amp;nbsp;Stephen Arterburn has provided us with a guide for making the right decisions&amp;nbsp;today to provide a redemptive path for tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—JOHN TOWNSEND&amp;nbsp;Coauthor of the bestseller &lt;i&gt;Boundaries&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am asking you to give up your life as you know it so that you can fi nd the life&amp;nbsp;God has for you. Take hold of your future today and make the choices that will&amp;nbsp;lead to your healing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—STEPHEN ARTERBURN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Psalm 147:3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
