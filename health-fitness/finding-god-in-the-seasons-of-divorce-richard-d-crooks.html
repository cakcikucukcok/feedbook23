  <title>Finding God in the Seasons of Divorce - Richard D. Crooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Finding God in the&lt;br /&gt;Seasons of Divorce&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A daily devotional for individuals working through the emotions and difficulties of divorce, this first volume, Autumn and Winter, deals with the early days of divorce, when so much of life is falling apart, becoming so difficult and uncertain. The book helps readers learn how to cope and to see that they are not alone, that God does care, and that the struggles have been faced by others as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This devotional is designed to coincide with the seasons of the process of divorce or other loss. Hence, readers may read daily or read the devotional at their own pace in an order that will bring help and encouragement as they slowly heal from divorce. A topical index addresses specific needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richards experiences result in a book that is a comforting, encouraging voice in the wilderness as readers seek to find Gods hand in new ways. This book is a resource, not only for pastors and counselors, but for anyone who desires to help a struggling friend or family member in the wake of divorce.&lt;/p&gt;" />
