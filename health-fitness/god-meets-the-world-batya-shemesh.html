  <title>God Meets the World - Batya Shemesh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Exodus 19, 16&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning, with a thick cloud over the mountain, and a very loud trumpet blast&amp;hellip;.&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; On that predestined day at Mount Sinai, God came out of the clouds to meet the world. What the Creator of the Universe said that day would become the most important rules ever written: The Ten Commandments. God introduced Himself with the words &amp;ldquo;I am the lord your God....&amp;rdquo; His voice was heard by millions. The meeting of the physical and the spiritual witnessed by such a massive assembly is a feat that has not reoccurred in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of The Ten Commandments was to give the whole world rules by which to build a just society. The Israelites had observed the greatness of God as He made unprecedented miracles to release them from bondage. They would be the witnesses that there is one God and He cares about the people that He created. God Meets the World is the story of The Ten Commandments from God&amp;rsquo;s point of view. The book describes how different ancient events recorded in the Bible inspired God to write The Ten Commandments. The second part of the book explains, in detail, the practical applications of The Ten Commandments in our modern society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideas in this book are original and real eye openers. This is a self-help book that can help change your outlook on life, strengthen your faith and help you make important decisions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
