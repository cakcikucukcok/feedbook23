      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered if the Internet can really damage a relationship? Have you ever wondered whether there is a risk in having cyber-friends when you are committed to someone? Has your significant other ever cheated on you with someone on the Internet? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on a study of sexual behavior of women and men in open and in closed relationships, The In-Factor Model can show you the unconscious process people follow online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings seek to make you aware of the risk that cyber-friends and the Internet can bring to a relationship, as well as provide you with a notion of what committed adults are doing online. Moreover, if someone cheated on you with a cyber-friend, this book may help you understand how and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whats more, professionals working with couples and committed individuals can benefit from this book since it shows the process that people follow online. Clinicians can understand, explain, and come up with strategies for each level of the process to help their clients that go through infidelity online in a simple and &lt;br /&gt;
clear way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in the magic of the Internet, then this handy book is for you.&lt;/p&gt;
