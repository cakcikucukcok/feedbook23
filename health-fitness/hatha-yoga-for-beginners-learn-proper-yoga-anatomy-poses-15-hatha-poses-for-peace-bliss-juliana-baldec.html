She inspired me and encouraged me not only to tap into the unlimited benefits of Yoga which helped me get rid of my breathing and Asthma problems, but she also inspired me to write this Yoga poses book that includes all the Yoga poses that I have been doing on a daily basis for for around 3 months now.

This is why I also included a cool 5 minute Yoga strategy for you..." />
