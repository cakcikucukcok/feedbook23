  <title>Smart Fat - Steven Masley, M.D., Jonny Bowden, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The innovative guide that reveals how eating more fat&amp;#8212;the smart kind&amp;#8212;is the key to health, longevity, and permanent weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years experts have told us that eating fat is bad. But by banning fat from our diets, we&amp;#8217;ve deprived ourselves of considerable health benefits&amp;#8212;and have actually sabotaged our own efforts to lose weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though they originally came from vastly different schools of thought about diet and weight loss, renowned nutritionist Jonny Bowden and well-respected physician Steven Masley independently came to the same conclusion about why so many people continually fail to shed pounds and get healthy. It all comes back to a distinction far more important than calories vs. carbs or paleo vs. plant-based: smart fat vs. dumb fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Smart Fat&lt;/em&gt;, they explain the amazing properties of healthy fat, including its ability to balance hormones for increased energy and appetite control, and its incredible anti-inflammatory benefits. The solution for slimming down&amp;#8212;and keeping the pounds off for life&amp;#8212;is to &amp;#8220;smart-fat&amp;#8221; your meals, incorporating smart fats with fiber, protein, and most importantly, flavor. Bowden and Masley identify smart fats, explain what not to eat, and provide a thirty-day meal plan and fifty recipes based on the magic formula of fat, fiber, protein, and flavor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s time to unlearn what we think we know about food. Getting smart about fat&amp;#8212;and everything you eat&amp;#8212;and learning to smart-fat your meals is the only solution you&amp;#39;ll ever need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
