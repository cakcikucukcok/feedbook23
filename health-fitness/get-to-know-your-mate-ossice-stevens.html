  <title>Get to Know Your Mate - Ossice Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Personality Extraction Profile
Whether a male or female, it is critical that we use every opportunity and means we have available to choose our mate. Life is short and you dont want to waste years on a dead end relationship, which will only cost you grief, time and money in the end. Many of our relationship problems could be avoided if we took a little more time when forming them. The Personality Extraction (PE) profile provides you with a way to begin this process. At the first intention of starting a relationship is when you begin your personality extraction. This rule applies to both sexes, though women need to be more cautious of the situations they place themselves in. Often, first dates are where a woman runs into unforeseen problems. Thats why it is important to apply the fundamentals of dating: know who you are dating, where they come from, their place of residence and something about their background; ask to see some identification, if they drive a car get a license number, but do this very discretely. However you do it make sure you get to know who you are dating. 
The Personality Extraction (PE) is a good way to start the process of getting to know your mate; you will come in contact with who he/she really is or he/she will fill you with lies. Caution is advised that while you are working on the Personality Extraction (PE) you must be patient until completing the PE as you watch your mates personality unfold before your eyes. 
We understand and perceive things we hear and see in different ways; this is why the PE is arranged for the various ways people may view questions. Of course, you have those who like to play word games, but as you will see the PE will give them ample opportunities to give a truthful answer. Serious questions are asked in several ways to ensure no misunderstanding of the question asked. You have to be able to track your mates answers mentally to be able to use this portion of the book. But if your mate is honest in his/her responses, you will not have to worry about tracking his/her responses considering the fact that all concerned know that the PE is safe-guarded against deception. Anyone trying to be deceptive in his/her answers should be looked upon as an untrustworthy person, incapable of having a meaningful relationship. There is no doubt that questions and answers are the foundation of all relationships. Without questions and answers there is no way to develop a relationship, this fact should be clear, and this is the foundation of the PEwithout proper questioning, where would any relationship go? How could we ever hope to accomplish anything without questions and answers? With the PE all the key questions are prepared for you; all you have to do is ask him/her and evaluate your proposed mates answers.
This tool consists of 572 questions which have been broken down into different workable formats, ranging from a one-month time frame to a 3-to-12 month time period. These workable formats have been made to give you some idea as to how to go about completing the book in its entirety. It is not recommended to try and complete the book in a hasty fashion. The one-month format is a reasonable for those who are willing to invest the time and mental interaction which is necessary to complete the Personality Extraction at this rapid, but realistic pace. The one-month process seems to display a true element of honesty while ultimately aiming to get the relationship off to a good start. But that choice is for you and your prospective mate to decide. Choosing a time frame for completion varies for each couple. The workable formats are just suggestions which will apply a reasonable completion date to look forward to. Choose your time frame and stick to it based on your own personal relationship desires and availability.
