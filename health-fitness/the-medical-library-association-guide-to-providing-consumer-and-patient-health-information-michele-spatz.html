  <title>The Medical Library Association Guide to Providing Consumer and Patient Health Information - Michele Spatz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Comprised of fifteen chapters written by experienced consumer health librarians, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Medical Library Association Guide to Providing Consumer and Patient Health Information &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is designed for library and information science graduate students as well as librarians new to health and medical librarianship, regardless of library setting. It is comprehensive in scope, covering all aspects of consumer and patient health and medical information from their humble, grassroots beginnings to the ever-evolving applications of new technology and social media. In between, the mundane aspects of health and medical librarianship, such as needs assessment, costs, budgeting and funding, and staffing are discussed. Adding richness to this discussion are the coverage of more sensitive topics such as patient-friendly technology, ethical issues in providing consumer and patient health information, meeting the needs of diverse populations, and responding to individuals from various cultural backgrounds. No comprehensive picture of consumer and patient health librarianship would be complete without addressing the critical importance of marketing and strategic partnerships; such discussions round out this invaluable guide. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
