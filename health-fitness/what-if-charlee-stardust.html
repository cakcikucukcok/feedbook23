  <title>What If? - Charlee Stardust</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What If explores and attempts to answer many of the questions each of us have thought of throughout our lives but may have been afraid to ask. Why am I here? Where did I come from? What created the universe? Which came first, the chicken or the egg?
Through many years of analysis and reflection, the author attempts the most logical conclusion of who we are, where we came from, our purpose for being, and more importantly, our relationship with our Creator. What If explores how our ego is primarily responsible for much of the negative dramas that play out in our lives; how the moment our egos began labeling things, we got into trouble; and how labeling turned into judgments and opinions. What If points to the fact that our purpose here on Earth is actually to enjoy the journey our life takes us on, and suggests ways to avoid the struggles and unhappiness that can easily interrupt us.
What If explores our world of form through our physical existence, and it helps us understand our more important beginnings in a place we might call heaven, in a nonphysical plane of existence. So get ready for a journey of discussions about subject matter that may be a little complex to entertain in our minds. What If helps smooth out kinks in those questions and hopes to give valid arguments for other more logical explanations.
We are not meant to suffer, ever! We are meant to find joy in everything we experience. We were created from love and are meant to experience only love until we get back home! The author.
With peace and love!" />
