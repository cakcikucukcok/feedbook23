  <title>The Case for Falling in Love - Mari Ruti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;The Case for Falling in Love&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Why play &#39;hard to get&#39; when you can just get what you want? Mari Ruti&#39;s lively research, from Plato to Freud to &lt;i&gt;Gossip Girl &lt;/i&gt;to her own bedroom, finally puts an end to playing games, and provides a resource for lovers and the love-scorned alike. A must-read for anyone who has ever fallen in love, wants to, or wants to know what went wrong.&quot;&lt;br&gt; -Arianne Cohen, creator of TheSexDiariesProject.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;At last, a relationship advice book that will actually work. If you&#39;re intelligent, interested in love, and like a book you can&#39;t put down, this is it. John Gray, move over.

It seems impossible, and maybe that&#39;s because you can&#39;t lock up your heart like that-not if you want the real thing. And maybe that&#39;s one of the best things about love.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve been thinking about it all wrong. Our culture&#39;s insistence that women need to learn how to catch and keep a man is actually doing much more harm than good. The more we try to manipulate our relationships, the less we are truly able to experience love&#39;s benefits and wonders.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love is a slippery, unruly thing, and trying to control and manage it robs us of its delicious unpredictability.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Sure, letting go of the reins a bit might mean a broken heart, but heartbreak, in fact, offers a wealth of possibilities-creativity, wisdom, and growth-that we need in order to make the most of our lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Liberating for women who are frustrated by the idea that they just need to learn the right &quot;formula,&quot; &lt;i&gt;The Case for Falling in Love &lt;/i&gt;shows that there &lt;i&gt;isn&#39;t &lt;/i&gt;a method to mastering the madness of love.
