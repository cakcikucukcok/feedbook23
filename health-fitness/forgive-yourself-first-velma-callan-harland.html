  <title>Forgive Yourself First - Velma Callan Harland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Forgive Yourself First takes you on a journey to a better place. You will gather a number of practical skills to help you to see and to deal with life situations differently. These new tools will enable you to choose a better path forward than you might have chosen in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examine what self-forgiveness really means. You will look at your own unique life story, the one that brought you to this book, and examine established behavioural patterns, emotions, and the role your ego has played in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might come face to face with the real you for the first time. You will learn strategies that will help move you to the next stop on the trip. You will learn how to identify and face your feelings and emotions, and to identify some of the most common defences people use against these fearful demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn to better recognise your established patterns of behaviour and begin to understand their consequences. How have specific events from your past influenced your present challenges? How do your current beliefs cause your reactions to life situations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People can evolve spiritually by examining what they like and dislike in the actions of other people, and understanding why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will learn how to maintain peace in any situation. Humour and relaxation techniques are introduced, along with prayer and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the book guides you through a review of the tools you have collected on the journey and placed in your personal toolbox for future reference and then helps you to formulate a plan for going forward in peace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
