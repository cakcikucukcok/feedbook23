  <title>Love on Air - Katlego Lehlabile</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To never give-up on love, it comes in different ways. One of these days we all going to feel and experience that true love. 
That true love does happen once in a while, whereby you just cant imagine your life with that person and willing even to die for that person. Eventually it might happen that you break-up and reality comes in. then you start experiencing different feeling for that person and you might even hate him/her more that you loved him/her. As life goes on, you start experiencing the same feelings of love for a different person and start realising that God can give you another chance to love again. Most important thing is that NEVER GIVE-UP ON LOVE 
I started writing this book when I was 20 years old, doing my first semester at Central University of Technology, Free State. 
What inspired me to write this book, was the true love I had for one of the ladies at home, the difficulties i had to go through just to win her heart, experiences I have encountered both spiritually and emotionally. 
This is the love I will always cherish, although both of us moved on with our lives with different people. 
I will like to thank my family for the support they have shown during this relationship, mostly I will like to thank God Almighty for hearing my prayers and supported me through the relationship period. 
To God be the glory!!!" />
