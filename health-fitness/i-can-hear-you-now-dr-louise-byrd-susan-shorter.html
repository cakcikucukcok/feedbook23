  <title>&quot;I Can Hear You Now!&quot; - Dr. Louise Byrd, Susan Shorter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Can Hear You Now, offers a profound opportunity for a child along with a mentoring adult to make a difference in their lives. This book is about two boys that discover how they can bridge the gap between them and their grandma. Things look quite chaotic until they come to the meeting of the minds and make plans to enhance their relationship.
This story is told from a childs perspective and is a fun- filled book for grade levels K-5. The end of the book engages the child and the adult to have meaningful conversations and to produce a product that can be used until the concepts are embedded into their lifestyle. 
The book serves as a tool that bridges the gap also between school and home. The principles needed in supporting a caring learning environment at school can also be implemented at home that empowers all parties.
I Can Hear You Now brings to life the experiences and antics of children recognized by teachers, parents and especially grandparents. Not only is this an enlightening storybook bringing smiles of familiarity, but a compilation of fun, easy and inexpensive strategies designed to help children develop problem solving skills and make wise choices. It is evident that I Can Hear You Now is a work of passion, both fresh and beautifully illustrated with a message for allit pays to hear what each other is saying. 
 Anne French, Former District Achievement Gap Coordinator 
Kentucky Department of Education (Ret.) 
Your children will bridge the knowing and doing gap as they experience reading I Can Hear You Now! Dr. Louise Byrd has penned an exciting story that will help youngsters positively thrive in home and school environments. Its sure to be a must-read in childrens literature for years to come. 
 Anthony Sanders, Ph.D. 
Education Professor, Austin Peay State University 
I Can Hear You Now is a wonderful and personal reflection of childhood learning opportunities that resonated with many of my early learning experiences. The authors ability to capture the learning and life experiences is a unique linguistic visual depicting key memories that shape how we learn and achieve together. Dr. Byrd, you have truly captured the essence and value of the grandmother-educator experience. 
 Michael D. Dailey 
Associate Director for Student Achievement 
I Can Hear You Now is a practical guide to behavioral management that can be utilized with children at home and at school. Dr. Byrd does a magnificent job of demonstrating how grandparents can make a real difference in the lives of their grandchildren through teaching simple lessons such as how to listen, share and learn new skills. And the benefit of these lessons will last a lifetime. 
 Katherine Greig, PhD, LISW, Med. 
CEO of New Perspective Counseling Center 
I Can Hear You Now provides a practical approach, combined with love and experience in empowering our youth to overcome obstacles and embrace problem solving! I salute Dr. Byrd for her guidance and celebrations of order while inspiring respect and leadership skills. Children are endearing, yearn for our guidance, but need the confirmation and nurturing from adults who believe in them. Thank you friend for a great system!!
