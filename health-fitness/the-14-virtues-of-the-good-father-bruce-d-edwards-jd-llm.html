      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Recent studies conducted by the National Center for Fathering and National Fatherhood Initiative show that only fifty percent of children spend their childhood in an intact family, and about one-third of all children live apart from their biological fathers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a father, your involvement is much greater than your mere presence. Fathers must ensure that their deeds exemplify their words in that the father exhibits the behavior he instills in his children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;develop the necessary spiritual awareness to lead and guide children;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;show affection and love to boost a childs self-esteem; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;comprehend what it means to spend quality time with children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether youre a parent, grandparent, guardian, teacher, mentor, or an adult who wants to make a difference by cultivating lasting connections with children, The 14 Virtues of the Good Father is a great resource guide to assist in developing and nurturing fatherly relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
