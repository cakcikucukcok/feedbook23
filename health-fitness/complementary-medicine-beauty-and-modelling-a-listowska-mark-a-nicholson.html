  <title>Complementary Medicine, Beauty and Modelling - A. Listowska, Mark A. Nicholson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Complementary Medicine, Beauty and Modelling offers readers the knowledge to naturally
improve their appearance, slow the ageing process, and experience increased physical and
emotional security. By understanding and applying some basic principles of complementary
medicine, readers should be able to strengthen their physical bodies, improving upon the individual
qualities that they appreciate most, whilst also improving upon those that they feel they might be
lacking.
Beauty is often considered a commodity reserved for the young and slim, and modelling the domain
of the impossibly attractive. As a result, the majority of both men and women may never envisage
themselves possessing the physical criteria for a career spent posing in front of cameras or strutting
the worlds catwalks.
However, it is important to remember that each person possesses individual characteristics and
personal attributes that make them unique. Addressing these attributes will improve their appearance,
and often result in improved temperament and appreciation of individual strengths.
The beauty that a woman expresses in her daily life is a declaration of herself and the person she
wishes to present to the world, whether it is while caring for children and family, managing a business,
studying, or spending time with friends and family. This is no less so for men, who often see physical
appearance and strength as a means to establish their relationship with their body and declare their
presence.
This book offers an insight into concepts of physical beauty and photographic modelling, and
encourages the reader to view the body from a different perspective. Physical features aside, the
book delves into the body/mind relationship, and draws upon the wisdom of philosophies such as
naturopathy, nutrition, traditional Chinese medicine, Bach flower remedies, acupuncture, mineral
therapy, iridology, yoga, meditation, and natural remedies, without ignoring skin care, cosmetics,
perfume, and paramedical tattooing.
With even a basic knowledge of the principles of complementary medicine, readers can begin to
understand and improve upon perceived flaws in their physical features, and gain the confidence
to recognise the personal attributes that make them each individuals. We encourage readers to
appreciate the unique beauty that is within each of us, and recognise that a nutritious diet, healthy
lifestyle, and positive view of themselves are the keys to maintain emotional stability and emphasise
their appearance." />
