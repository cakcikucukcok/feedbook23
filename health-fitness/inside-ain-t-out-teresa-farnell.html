  <title>Inside Ain’T Out - Teresa Farnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inside Aint Out is a nonfiction religion/inspirational book.
Inside Aint Out will navigate you through a mirror to reveal the half-truths you have been fed. The reflection the world gives you is only one-sided, and there are so many beautiful attributes you are neglecting. However, to discover them, you should turn to your heart inside and compass it toward the Masters word. Through the pages of this book, you will discover how your inner beauty outlines your appearance. We will unmask the fragile and impressionable woman and restore the confidence in which you are heir through a heavenly kingdom. Through the authority given to you in scripture, you will discover how to eradicate the negativity and allow positive qualities to take root, nurture, and develop.
Gods Word is designed to refocus you from what the world thinks of you to what He thinks of you. In doing this, you will keep your human responsibility and protect yourself from destruction. Through the grace of God, you will regenerate your mind to reveal the image the world has hid. Finally, you will discover how to achieve a balance and know self-worth and reaffirm your value. Now when the final page is flipped, you will get a glimpse of Gods affection and yet find it totally invigorating, and its only a glimpse! Once you know who you are, it will be difficult to see yourself any other way. Only a heart after Gods heart leaves a legacy. I pray this book will effectively rebuild you into a positive individual through the power of the one true love, God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost." />
