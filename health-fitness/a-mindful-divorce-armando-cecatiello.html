  <title>A Mindful Divorce - Armando Cecatiello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The end of a relationship is always a difficult moment that inevitably brings suffering to the former partners, children and all the people close to the couple in crisis. If we add resentment, desire for revenge and anger, the mix can become explosive and make life impossible for everyone. If we view crisis and divorce as a possibility to begin a new life, we can solve the problems in a different and constructive manner, and often even make life better.&lt;br /&gt;
This book is meant for married or unmarried couples involved in a family crisis and who seek a successful method to find shared and lasting solutions to their problems, considering the interests of all parties involved. It is also geared for professionals wanting a full picture of the Collaborative Process: lawyers, psychologists, social workers and all those who deal with conflict in general and family crisis in particular. They will find in Collaborative Process an innovative, non-judicial method to solve a conflict.&lt;br /&gt;
There is no battle to win: true victory is finding shared solutions together that benefit all, children included.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Armando Cecatiello, Divorce Lawyer, Mediator and Writer, has handled divorce cases both in the courtroom and outside of the judicial system for over 20 years. Specialized in Collaborative Process as well as a trainer in this innovative method, he has vast experience in all matters of family law where he employs a conscious and sustainable approach." />
