  <title>I Didn’T Know How to Pray - Leah Bosque</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Im pretty sure many of us have read books about functioning drug addicts. If you havent, you will be surprised at how much we can get away with before we hit rock bottom. I remember sitting in rehab and thinking, Oh no, not another story about a drug addict. But now I thank God Almighty for that because now Im writing mine. My life has been a dysfunctional one since the day I was born. I believe it has been a journey that most of us exdrug addicts have walked; Im not any different. I have been lost for many years, and it was not until June 2014 that I found myself completely because I found God. As you read my book, you will see how we fell and got up and how it was not until we found God that we truly healed. And I was found in himnot having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith (Philippians 3:19)." />
