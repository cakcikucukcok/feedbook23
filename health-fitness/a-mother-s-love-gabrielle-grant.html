      <meta name="description" content="Most of us live our lives trying to find ways to fulfill that void in our hearts. Whether its a relationship, a career, being adopted, trying to find our biological parents, etc. That pain eats away at the emptiness inside that some of us ignore. As if we can go on with our lives being empty. It hurts and just imagine being helpless and treated coldheartedly by the one you love. Imagine your own mother hates you. Theres plenty that have suffered this experience and they know how much it hurts. The love that should be our first in life is now absentthe love from our own parents. Gracie is tough and never stops loving our mother no matter the storm, and yet she doesnt know any better than we do. Its incredible." />
