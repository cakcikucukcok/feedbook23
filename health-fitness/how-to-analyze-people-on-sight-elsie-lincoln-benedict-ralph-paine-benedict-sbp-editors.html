  <title>How to Analyze People on Sight - Elsie Lincoln Benedict, Ralph Paine Benedict, Sbp Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Modern science has proved that the fundamental traits of every individual are indelibly stamped in the shape of his body, head, face and hands-an X-ray by which you can read the characteristics of any person on sight.&lt;br /&gt;
The most essential thing in the world to any individual is to understand himself. The next is to understand the other fellow. For life is largely a problem of running your own car as it was built to be run, plus getting along with the other drivers on the highway.&lt;br /&gt;
From this book you are going to learn which type of car you are and the main reasons why you have not been getting the maximum of service out of yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
Also you are going to learn the makes of other human cars, and how to get the maximum of co-operation out of them. This co-operation is vital to happiness and success. We come in contact with our fellowman in all the activities of our lives and what we get out of life depends, to an astounding degree, on our relations with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Elsie Lincoln Benedict was a famous human analyst and her views, especially as put forward in this book, captured an enormous audience and were massively famous in their day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
