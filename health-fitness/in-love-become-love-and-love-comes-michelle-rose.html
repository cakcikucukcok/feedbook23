      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you wonder if you will ever have love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you attract the wrong partners?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you scared to open up?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love is not just for lucky people, and meeting your ultimate partner is no accident. The real rule to love is simple: love is drawn to love. Finding love isn&amp;rsquo;t a matter of looking outside of yourself, but rather discovering what it is within you that&amp;rsquo;s created the barriers that keep it out, so you can send them crashing down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her personal story of heartache, defeat, and finally to deep and fulfilling love, Michelle Rose teaches you how to attract and keep the love of your life, for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Love&lt;/em&gt; details step-by-step how to break down your unconscious walls, so you learn how to trust again and know with certainty that heartbreak is a thing of the past. By following this plan, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to commit to loving and accepting yourself, so your soul mate will find and commit to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Michelle&amp;#39;s coaching changed my life. With her guidance I was able to change my career path, find my soul calling, heal my body, and of course, meet the love of my life&amp;rdquo; -Erin Dooley&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michelle Rose is an international love and relationship coach who has conducted over a thousand hours of private coaching and taught workshops in the USA, Hawaii, UK and Australia.
