  <title>Jointman, a Survival Guide for Rheumatoid Arthritis - Robert B.W. Morton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Jointman, A Survival Guide for Rheumatoid Arthritis&lt;/b&gt;, by Robert B.W. Morton B.A., B.E.D. is a self-help book as well as a personal testimonial, as the author describes his medical history relating to this debilitating disease, from initial diagnosis, to prescribed medications and their side-effects, to surgery, and resulting post-surgical trauma, stress and depression. This book takes a positive stance, as medical, emotional and spiritual concerns are all addressed, and solutions are revealed. Some areas included in the 14 chapters are: Identifying RA, Debilitation and Diagnosis, Treatment, Surgery, Stress, Nutrition and Weight Control, The 4 Keys to Spiritual Healing, Support Groups, and Surviving Tomorrow. Robert Morton is a teacher and formerly a skier, hockey player, varsity fencer at the University of Western Ontario, a drummer, long-distance runner, artist and draftsman. All these skills and talents were visciously stripped away one afternoon, as arthritis lashed out and cut Rob down, eventually rolling him into a stiff immovable ball. After struggling with all the various hardships associated with this disease over the next 22 years, Rob has develpoed solutions and strategies to defend against the darker side of arthritis, and his coping skills have afforded him a positive outlook, and a future that includes returning to work, and living a complete, full life. Jointman includes a forward by Dr.Sharon Le Clercq, a leading rheumatologist, and Mr.Morton&#39;s doctor for over 10 years. Dr. LeClercq became Rob&#39;s confidant and assisted greatly in the final compilation of this unique manuscript. Any person suffering from arthritis and looking for answers, will greatly appreciate this first-hand view of the disease, and associated coping strategies. Jointman is a winner in every sense of the word." />
