  <title>Destiny Embrace Me  Lord, Let Future  Uphold Me - Dynasty Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This real inspirational book on life story of a young African American girl who grew up by a single-parent home, basically with fatherless syndrome to abusive marriages, enduring emotional, physical, and finical abuse, never losing faith in God and tenacity in life. What became her worst nightmare was becoming a single parent who raised three daughters and nearly lost it all from a near-miss assault to her children leading to bankruptcy. Yet she survives life, earthquake, hurricanes, twisters, and tsunamis by praising, pressing, and pushing her faith to inspire and become an inspiration to women who have experienced brokenness, bitterness, rejection, and heartache to health issues. She now lives to encourage women that a destiny and a future is still a reality if you trust and believe God for purpose and vision. She is now celebrating a new book, a home built from the ground, and three daughters in college. The oldest graduates as an engineer in May 2017; The 20 year old is as a third-year guidance counselor major; and the youngest who is 18 is on a scholarship and pursuing a career as a trauma physician. Last but not least, Dynasty Hill has found new purpose as a life coach, blogger, and physical-fitness mentor, and her work can be seen with Crystal and Pearls Inspiring Life Coach Ministry. She is a new author and soon to travel around the globe with motivational speeches inspiring youth, young adults, and women around this world." />
