With &lt;i&gt;The 90/10 Weight-Loss Plan&lt;/i&gt;, dieters learn to balance their food intake by eating 90% healthy, nutritious food, with 10% &quot;Fun Food&quot;--whatever they want, whenever they want. Nutritionist Joy Bauer has created a phenomenon that has taken the nation by storm: a diet that is healthy and easy to follow. And since dieters don&#39;t feel deprived of their favorite foods, &lt;i&gt;The 90/10 Weight-Loss Plan&lt;/i&gt; is a program they can stay on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The innovative plan offers:&lt;br&gt;- Three different caloric levels, based on one&#39;s weight-loss goal&lt;br&gt;- 42 meals for each level, including breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks&lt;br&gt;- Meals that provide the most nutrition possible, while reducing saturated fat and cholesterol intake&lt;br&gt;- Meals that help reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer&lt;br&gt;- Menus that are designed to include food the dieter will love!&lt;/p&gt;" />
