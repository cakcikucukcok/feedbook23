      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Had enough of that bridezilla? Feeling alone in a new city? Dealing with the trauma of the worst breakup ever--with someone you never even made out with?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve heard the path to fulfillment has much to do with relationships. But while it&#39;s often thought that for young women, it&#39;s all about finding the right man, real women beg to differ: It&#39;s friendships that are at the heart of happiness. Unfortunately, they&#39;re also at the heart of drama, stress, and sometimes not-so-great escapades after that fifth martini. And, technology, from texting to Facebook, has made all friendships more complicated than ever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last comes &lt;i&gt;The Friendship Fix,&lt;/i&gt; jam-packed with practical ways to improve your life by improving your circle. From dealing with friends-with-benefits to coworkers from the dark side, from feeling alone to being desperate to defriend a few dozen people, Andrea Bonior, Ph.D. helps you make the most of your friendships, whether they be old, new, online, or in person.&lt;/p&gt;" />
