  <title>Life Support - Vonnie Cavanaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;DO YOU WISH TO KNOW GODS LOVE AS HE COMFORTS YOU?&lt;BR&gt;
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW GOD HAS HELPED OTHERS&lt;BR&gt;
THROUGH THEIR TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Life Support&lt;/i&gt;, the author has approached a multitude of topics: aging, anger, pride, changing your attitude, learning to be content, dealing with guilt, finding joy, and knowing God more as you walk with Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gods comfort, we find He has all the same emotions you do, and one should derive a sense of joy from this knowledge, even when facing harsh realities such as death and loss. With the help of God, you have the ability to make your life all it can be! You may look back at the window of the past or look forward to the door of the future! Which will it be? Its your choice! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions presented in &lt;i&gt;Life Support&lt;/i&gt; will allow you to start your own Life Support Class, where you and others can learn how to make better decisions and have more faith than you ever had before. &lt;/p&gt;" />
