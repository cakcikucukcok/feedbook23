  <title>Things Jon Didn’t Know About - Sue Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Jon, my husband, took his own life at the age of 35. He left for work at 7.30, as usual. He kissed me, and our two children, as usual. He told me he loved me, which was not usual, but that didn&#39;t occur to me until later.&quot;
Sue Henderson candidly recounts the experience of raising her family as a single parent survivor of suicide. Alongside an honest and moving account of the day-to-day practicalities and emotional impact of Jon&#39;s death, there&#39;s advice on how to talk to children about death and suicide, how to support them as they grow up, and how to be aware of the heightened emotional risks for bereaved children.
She also draws on her experience as a social worker of 25 years to provide a theoretical framework for the book in which she discusses theories of grief and bereavement, issues of men&#39;s mental health, and the heightened incidence of male suicide." />
