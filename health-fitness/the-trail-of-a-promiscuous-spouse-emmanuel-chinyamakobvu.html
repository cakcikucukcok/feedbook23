  <title>The Trail of a Promiscuous Spouse - Emmanuel Chinyamakobvu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In fact Samantha was convinced that her husband Tito, as she preferred calling him was having an affair with the pretty housemaid Wanting to set a trap for her husband, Samantha did not inform Tito when he returned home from work that evening that the maid was away for the weekend. As soon as Tito closed the bathroom door, Samantha promptly dashed along the corridor, out at the back, went round the house, on to the verandah and into the maids bedroom.  She just had the time to switch the lights off when the door quietly opened and closed again. Momentarily he had taken off all her under wears and got on top of her..
      When he had finished and still panting, Samantha said You didnt expect to find me in this bed, did you? and switched on the light.
      No indeed, Madam, I didnt, said in a very low voice the young man who lodged next door.  
      That was the condemned night when the illicit affair between Samantha and Toby had begun many years ago and it had continued unabated since then and remained under the lid undiscovered until that fateful day when Marjorie was taken to hospital ill, in the middle of the night." />
