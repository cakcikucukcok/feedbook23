  <title>United States Army Third Infantry Division Directorate of Morale, Welfare, and Recreation - Michael D. Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The objective in this work was to analyze the structure and organization in the operations of a military
 organization that supports one of the greatest Divisions of the United States Army, the 3rd Infantry 
Division. The history of Morale, Welfare and Recreation Division as it relates to civilians employees, 
soldiers, family members and the Ft Stewart, Hunter Army Airfield Community. Morale, Welfare, and 
Recreation history started on the battlefields of World War 1 were Salvation Army sisters and Red Cross 
volunteers ministered to the needs of soldiers. The focus of this work provided administrative aspects of 
public administration and its effects on military success. On October 18th, 2007 Chief of Staff of the Army 
General George W. Casey Jr, and Secretary of the Army Pete Green signed and unveiled the Army Family 
Covenant pledging to support its soldiers and families, and active guard and reserve organizations with 
funding programs to deliver a quality of life commensurate with their service and sacrifices to the 
nation. It is this commitment that propelled and motivates this organization. The Army Morale, Welfare 
and Recreation exists because the United States Army states  it is committed to the wellbeing of the 
community of people who serve and stand ready to defend the nation and enhance the lives of soldiers,
 their families, civilian employees and military retirees. In all organizations there will be transition, 
changes and improvements within their environments I hope with this work I have opened the minds 
and hearts of those brave men and women who love the military and the United States of America. With 
god on our side who can defeat us." />
