      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Find Your Soul. Discover your life purpose.&lt;br /&gt;
We are in the middle of an evolutionary shift in human consciousness, from being centred on individualism to the realization that we are One Consciousness. In the transition we can feel overwhelmedbut if we just focus on evolving ourselves we positively affect everyone!&lt;br /&gt;
In Find Your Soul you learn how to connect with your soul and manifest your role in the evolutionary plan. &lt;br /&gt;
Align with your soul using self transforming ideas and 9 powerful heart-centred meditations that open your heart. Use these short meditations daily and gradually your soul purpose becomes clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A must read if you are on a journey of transformation. Hilarys book is a constant source of inspiration and guidance --If you have a vision of a &quot;world full of grace with plenty of abundance for Everyone&quot; this is a map to get there. With insight and integrity, she opens new doors of self awareness and leads us to release the power within. Pat Helferty. Owner Recruitment Agency. &lt;br /&gt;
An insightful perspective and practical guide to personal awareness and fulfillment., Inspirational! Hilary thinks outside the box&#39;. She has provided an enlightened message from the depths of her life experience. Undaunted after a devastating personal tragedy, her book is a testimony to the strength of the human spirit and gives a recipe for inner peace. Barry Bates. Consultant.&lt;br /&gt;
Every so often the perfect book appears just at the right time! Helps to discern who is in command in your life, the ego or the soul. Meditation exercises help to elevate your consciousness. Judy Tollifson. Teacher&lt;br /&gt;
A very accessible book to feel more connected to ones soul&#39;s purpose. Reveals psychological and spiritual ways to work with the suggestions. I particularly like the spareness filled with teaching. Joan McClintock. Therapist&lt;/p&gt;" />
