  <title>The Legend of Heart Failure - Foluke Omosule</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Foluke Omosules father seemingly had it all: lots of money, lots of women, and lots of smarts.
But the business-savvy Nigerian also had a bad heart, and even after doctors warned him that he needed to change his lifestyle, he continued eating and drinking whatever he wanted.
Even when his daughter tried to intervene, he refused to modify his behaviors, and died prematurely when he should be enjoying his children and grandchildren. However, with rigorous treatment and a willing patient, the outcome could have been much different.
Foluke, a long time registered nurse, who spent over twelve years in cardiology service, explains who is most likely to develop heart failure in this handbook. The book will help you:
take steps that could prevent the disease in the first place;
find the treatment regimen that will work best for you;
cope with the psychological effects of a negative diagnosis.
Youll also get a heart failure medical checklist, an appendix of terms, and answers to common questions that many people are too afraid to ask.
With early detection and determination, its never too late to take advantage of a second chance to live a healthy lifestyle and win the fight against heart failure." />
