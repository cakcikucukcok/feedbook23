  <title>At Death&#39;s Door - Sebastian Sepulveda Md, Gini Graham Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span style=&quot;tab-stops:left 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;At Death&amp;rsquo;s Door: End of Life Stories from the Bedside&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; tells the powerful story of Sebastian Sepulveda&amp;rsquo;s experiences in working with patients at the end of their lives. In some cases, death came quickly, after the patient was first diagnosed with a terminal condition and entered the hospital. In other cases, patients had a long, progressive illness that got increasingly worse over the months or years until they were in their final days. In some cases, patients were able to fight off death for many years. Hard decisions are often made&amp;mdash;whether to resuscitate or not, whether to choose hospice or not, who makes the decisions when a patient cannot, and whose decision to follow when several family members are involved in decision making. Written from the perspective of a medical doctor from years of experience, this personal approach to the end of life explores the many options available to patients and their families and reveals how real people have come to those decisions, and how they play out. With insight and sensitivity, Sepulveda offers families an important window into how life can end with compassion, care, control, and dignity. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;tab-stops:left 144pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;At Death&amp;rsquo;s Door&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; features over fifty stories drawn from Sepulveda&amp;rsquo;s experience as a doctor dealing with these patients and families. As states debate the legality of assisted suicide and other end of life rights, real people make real decisions every day regarding end of life. Their stories come to life in these pages, and readers with similar concerns will find relief, comfort, and company as they face these decisions themselves. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
