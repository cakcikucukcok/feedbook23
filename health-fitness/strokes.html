  <title>Strokes                                           Revised Edition - Martin J. H. Povser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No book has portrayed the provocative topic of handwriting analysis with as much sweep and depth. Veteran handwriting analyst Martin Povser covers all the issues that have intrigued the public and analysts themselves, including the ones about doctors writing and printed writing. Since an analysis determines the writers personality, he shows many practical uses for an analysis, from personal and family to commercial and governmental. He even delves into cutting-edge issues, such as graphotherapyreforming your personality by altering your handwriting. What about people with serious social problems? Povser discusses what we can learn from the writing of anorexics, ax murderers, embezzlers, and the sexually abused. In breaking new ground, Povser also takes you inside with professional analyst Allan K. Grim, Jr., recounting his diverse experiences, showing his analysis steps, and conveying his outspoken opinions. Some people link handwriting analysis with dubious subjects like astrology and fortune telling. Acknowledging critics attack his subjects validity, Povser airs the arguments for and against it. However, he makes his case for the public and psychology to accept it as a serious scientific subject. In a bold statement he also explains why he believes it is better than any other psychological test or technique for revealing personality. Povsers writing style is intimate, off -beat, and sometimes daft, while he expresses candid, dignifi ed views about handwriting analysis. In this innovative book Povser enlightens us about our unique, personal possessionour handwriting. You will never look at your writing the same again." />
