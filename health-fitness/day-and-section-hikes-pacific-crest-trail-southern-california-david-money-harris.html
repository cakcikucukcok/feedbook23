  <title>Day and Section Hikes Pacific Crest Trail: Southern California - David Money Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The Pacific Crest Trail was designated as one of the first National Scenic Trails way back in 1968. As it traverses the &amp;#147;high road&amp;#8221; from Mexico to Canada, incredible views are not only commonplace but also uniquely diverse, because the trail connects six of North America&amp;#8217;s seven eco-zones. The PCT&amp;#8217;s familiar, well-worn path is a special place for hikers from all walks of life on walks of all lengths and for all reasons.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of guiding you through the arduous task of hiking the entire PCT, the goal of this book is to help you plan trips that incorporate hiking on the PCT in Southern California, whether you have just an afternoon to spare or you want to escape for the entire weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Carefully edited maps and elevation graphs generated with GPS data collected by the author on the trail will help make your trip a success.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This cargo-pocket guide offers author-tested advice to help you make the most of your time away from civilization, however long (or short) that stretch may be.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
