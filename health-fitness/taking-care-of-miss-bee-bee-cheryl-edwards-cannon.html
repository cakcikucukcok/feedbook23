  <title>Taking Care of Miss Bee Bee - Cheryl Edwards-Cannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cheryl Edwards-Cannons mother was diagnosed with early-onset dementia in 1995 at a time when there was little information available to help her navigate the journey. It was up to Cheryl to find out what she could about how this disease would affect her mother and the rest of the family dynamics. Over time, she became the daughter extraordinaire, who made the whole caregiver role look marvelously simple.
Revealed in a series of heartwarming, real-life vignettes, Cheryls story is designed to help the reader cope with their own challenges in taking care of someone who no longer can do it for herself. From dressing to travelling to shopping, Cheryl learns how to see the world through the eyes of her mother. In a charming, witty fashion, she describes exactly what you as a caregiver need to learn to do and how to keep yourself from either going insane or perhaps going to jail.
Fueled by her caregiving experiences and spiritual beliefs, the author was inspired to develop a resource for families encountering elder-care challenges called Clear Path Choices, which provides one-on-one consulting as well as a six-week learning experience designed to help families make decisions for their own lives and for those entrusted to their care." />
