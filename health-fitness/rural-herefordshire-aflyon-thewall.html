  <title>Rural Herefordshire - Aflyon Thewall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Possibly the worst crime known in the Herefordshire farming community.
On a family farm near a small market town in North Herefordshire. My Mother had been blissfully content for fifty years, but in the Autumn of 2001 when she became slightly weakened by ill-health, family predators pounced on her.  For the next two and a half years she was subjected to Elder Abuse.  Mother was threatened, bullied, intimidated, and cruelly and harshly treated to ensure she stayed silent while her financial affairs were plundered.  She was then persecuted til her death.
Tragically, the same fate was bestowed her faithful farm-help, who had been loyal to my Mother for 28 years, but he was also targeted by the family predators to be a victim.  He was hounded, persecuted and falsely discredited until his spirit was destroyed.  He died in 2013 aged 61, a broken man.
This crime was planned, well organised and ruthlessly executed to embezzle in excess of 500,000 and possibly making it one of the worst crimes known within the Herefordshire farming community.
This account is a reflection of the changing ways of the modern world, where values that once upheld society are being trashed far too often.  The subject of sociopathy is touched on to raise awareness of the increasing danger it is posing to society.  Also covered is the disturbing revelation that we can no longer depend on the establishment-the judicial, the legal and the criminal systems to be fair and just.
For the time being all we can do is raise awareness  .  .  .  .  .  .  .
Note: This book has been written with help from some rather naughty Golliwogs from Pettifers hardware store who found themselves arrested by over zealous local police officers." />
