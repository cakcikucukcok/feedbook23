  <title>Love, Laughter &amp; Tears - Debbie Eddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love, Laughter &amp; Tears is a book that draws you into Debbie and Larrys lives with a blended family of five children. You will  find yourself laughing and crying as you relate. Each chapter draws you into the trials and tribulations they experienced and conquered with Gods help. They had to learn to stretch as they grew through past hurts!  Nothing is impossible with their God. Their love continues to grow after 36 years of marriage.  
In these pages you will find: the humor of two families becoming one,  the enemy attempts to destroy, helping others in time of their own needs, testimonies of the greatness of God, finding a secret place, blessings of mission trips, learning to nail rebellious grandchildren to the cross, and the Joy that does come.
Debbie Eddy is an author that loves to share her heart of lifes interesting trials, with a twist of humor. She is able to express honest truth of how we humanly deal with our problems and  how God uses them to train and grow us up by His spirit. People always say to her, I came to you because you will tell me the truth, no matter how much it hurts!
Debbie has taught children and childrens workers in the local church and mission field. She has taken counseling and childrens writing courses. Debbie is an Ordained Minister of the Gospel, teaching, preaching, anointed of the Holy Spirit and moving in the God given gifts of intercession, deliverance, exhortation and prophecy." />
