  <title>The Simple and Natural Way - Shailaja Prashant Kedari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Simple and Natural Way&lt;/i&gt; offers a practical and simple guide to perfect weight, radiant health, and, eventually, a transformed life. The book is about something that most of us know in theory but very few practice; it focuses on Fletcherism, in theory and in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theory is supported by the work of the American health guru Horace Fletcher (18491919), including various experiments of strength and endurance conducted on him and several Fletcherites before and after him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice is based on my own experience and results with Fletcherism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is for all those who are struggling with weight issuesthe underweights and the overweights. Fletcherism works like magic. On a comparative analysis, this practice is easier to adopt than any of the diet or exercise routines. This raises its acceptance quotient even with hard core foodies. It is for all those who are struggling with any health issue, whether directly or indirectly connected with incorrect eating and nutrition, and for all those who wish to live life to fullest possible physical potential in terms of their strength, endurance and physical health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide points out all the massive and unbelievable benefits of Fletcherising, which are not just confined to your body but also reach your mind. The practice can help quit lifelong addictions, cravings, and even unnatural walking, breathing and sleeping habits. It can transform your lifeeven if you dont believe it can! When you align even one part of your life to natures ways (through Fletcherism), every other aspect follows harmoniously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fletcherism has changed author Shailaja Kedaris life in ways she couldnt have imagined. With the help of this book, you can experience the same or even more miraculous changes in your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
