  <title>Soul Mates: a Love so True - Juliet Denise Kearse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book you have in your hands is an instructional guide with the steps that you can take that will bring more organization and skills to help you improve your marriage and relationship.
Taking care of your husband may not be a simple task, but a step-by-step guide will help ease the toil of what you should do.
Soul Mates: A Love So True gives you different areas of your marriage we all run into, which includes examples and gives you answers on how to handle various situations. 
I use my personal marriage with more than twenty-six years of experience to direct you on how to live a married life according to the Word of God. This book is scriptural based. There are selections of poems, prayers, and reflections. Lifes challenges can always be resolved through basic answers. I hope this book will give you some direction and, if steps are followed, will allow you to have a rewarding relationship. Keep God wrapped all in your marriage.
The purpose of this book is to teach a woman how to love her husband according to the Word. It does just that. I hope you enjoy and get what you need to help make your life a wonderful experience.
My husband and I have been married for more than twenty-six years. We have had our challenges, as you will find in the book, but God brought us through all the trying times. Again, thank you for your support." />
