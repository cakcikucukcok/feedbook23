  <title>The Balancing Act - Hally v.P. Brandle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each of us has so many aspects to who we are as a person it is easy to become overwhelmed in trying to move forward. It becomes too hard and some of us even give up.
As we take one step into tomorrow we are often forced to face challenges we are not always prepared for that can leave us afraid of change; afraid of the unknown and consequently afraid of ourselves. It is often said that most of us do not fear our failures, we fear our success and so do anything possible to avoid the one thing that we so desperately yearn. 
We all want to be happy, we all want to be fulfilled and yet we find ourselves putting conditions on the very things that are readily available to us. We convince ourselves believing that the status quo is as good as it gets and we feel selfish to want something more. 
The Balancing Act is a book of articles compiled to help every person for almost every situation. Between all the responsibilities we face with all the roles we take on it can be a Balancing Act to find something that works for us, whether it is a shortage of time or limited resources, or even the ability to believe that at the end of the day we deserve to be happy.
There are no quick fixes to anything. The only quick fix is to make the decision that you deserve to be happy and you deserve the best life has to offer, simply because you are you.
The Balancing Act is a stepping stone to assist you to move towards whatever your heart desires and whatever it is that gets you up in the morning and know it is going to be a good day!" />
