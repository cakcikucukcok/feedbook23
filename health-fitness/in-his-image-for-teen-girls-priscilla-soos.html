  <title>In His Image for Teen Girls - Priscilla Soos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God created each of us in His image, and when He was finished, He said, It is good. These three words from the book of Genesis give us all enormous valueone that is not limited to a future in heaven. In His Image for Teen Girls began as a quest by author Priscilla Soos to explain the value of these three little words and more for her teen daughter. We all need to understand how much worth, strength, and focus can come from knowing that we are each created in Gods image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;A personal understanding of what it means to be created in Gods image not only helps us to defend against the negative images pressing down on us every day, but also provides the tools to lift us up to the level God has planned for us. God opened Sooss eyes and helped her see that the challenges her daughter faced were the same as those she encountered at a similar age. The situations differed, but the core issues were the same: the worth she placed on herself would reflect not only the value others would place on her, but also the value she would accept from her environment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;In His Image for Teen Girls seeks to help teen girls understand that being created in Gods image makes them heirs to God and His kingdom.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
