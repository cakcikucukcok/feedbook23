  <title>Breakfast with Mike - Gary Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gary was greatly influenced by Mike Spencer not only in his academic career but also his personal life. His friendship with Mike started when he was a young man and continued for over 40 years. He and Mike had many common interests. At their regular breakfast outings, Mike would share his thoughts on topics ranging from sports to education to his family. Breakfast with Mike details many of those discussions - some funny, some philosophical but always interesting. One of Mike&#39;s great loves was University of Illinois basketball. One of his favorite breakfast-time discussions was the team, their coach and the time they almost won a national championship." />
