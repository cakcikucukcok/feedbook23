  <title>Adulting Financially for Millenials - Zach Yereb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="OK, sooooo what do we do with our money? Our education system may think its important to teach topics such as physics and the Pythagorean theorem, but I think that for the 98% of Americans that will never use it, we need to cover the things 100% of Americans need, like balancing your budget and understanding your credit scoreyou know, that thingy you need to buy a house with.
	In this book, we will talk about that jackass of an elephant in the room (oh geez not Clinton or Trumpsee what I did there?)credit card debts and student loans, the things that give you the equivalent turbulent feeling of walking into the bathroom on a commercial airline flight simultaneously as the captain announces hes turning the Fasten Seatbelt sign back on due to rough weather. 
	What about life insurance? Retirement? Im going to touch on everything youre worried about (but not like a creepy doctor). Let me just make one thing clear: my intent is for you to understand you need to put a financial plan in place and that you need a financial advisor. Everyones financial situation is different, and everyone needs help. These are my own opinions (correct opinions, mind you). Statements and/or opinions in this publication are my own and are not affiliated or a reflection on the Department of Defense." />
