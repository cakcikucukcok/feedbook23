  <title>The Color of Marriage - Joe Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Color of Marriage was written so that you and I would learn the habit of making a conscious effort to live out the word of God in our marriages. When you trust in the word of God and consciously live it out, you will find real life solutions to the various conflicts and challenges of your marriage. These are the kinds of conflicts and challenges that will prevent your marriage from reaching its greatest potential if they go unresolved. If these conflicts and challenges go unresolved long-term, they will ultimately diminish, damage, and even destroy your marriage and many times your character as well. I believe there would be fewer divorces in the Christian Community if we had the biblical principles of The Color of Marriage hidden in our hearts and ready for use during our times of conflict and challenge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
