Children in many ways remind me of a lovely butterfly. They should never be forced into sexual behavior before they are fully developed, their mind, body and soul. It can damage them beyond hope. Just as the butterfly goes through its stages of metamorphosis and emerge into a beautiful butterfly, so it is with our children if we allow them to grow at the natural stages of development. They will grow into productive and beautiful adults." />
