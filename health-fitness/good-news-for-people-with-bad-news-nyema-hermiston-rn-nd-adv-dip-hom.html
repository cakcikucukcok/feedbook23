  <title>Good News for People with Bad News - Nyema Hermiston Rn Nd Adv Dip Hom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;What happens when the medical treatment you receive does not work, or there is no treatment available and you are left facing a debilitating disease or a shortened life?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Nyema Hermiston, a registered nurse and longtime natural therapist, answers that question and many others, through the interviews of dozens of men and women who explain how they recovered from debilitating and life-threatening conditions, ranging from autoimmune disease, cancer, severe allergies, and pain.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, far too many people are told there is nothing that can be done about their conditions, and they never seek out alternative treatments due to their unscientific status. They dont stop to contemplate the risks associated with orthodox medical treatments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For instance, in the United States, medical error claims the lives of 400,000 people every year, making it the third leading cause of all deaths. In Australia, medical treatment causes 18,000 deaths per year and injures up to 50,000 more.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Alternative treatments that include nutrition and little-known medical therapies are often less risky and as effective as standard treatments. Find out how they could save your life or the life of a loved one in &lt;i&gt;Good News for People with Bad News&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;" />
