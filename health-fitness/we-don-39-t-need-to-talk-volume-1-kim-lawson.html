      <meta name="description" content="&#39;A secret of having a successful relationship is to be in one with a man who wants to be in one, for a start!&#39; So Pam had discovered after wasting nearly 20 years with those who hadn&#39;t deserved her affection or her time. But she hadn&#39;t known what to look for in a partner, or even that she had to look for anything. Due to her own ignorance and stupidity, she hadn&#39;t known what should be tolerated in a relationship or that she should be treated with respect. Then there&#39;d been her mother&#39;s ongoing aggravating presence to contend with... In &#39;We (Don&#39;t) Need to Talk&#39; Volumes 1 and 2, Pam describes bouncing from one upsetting relationship to another as well as her mother&#39;s contribution to her state of confusion. And she asks herself why, throughout her life, she has never thought of herself as being deserving of anyone who was her equal." />
