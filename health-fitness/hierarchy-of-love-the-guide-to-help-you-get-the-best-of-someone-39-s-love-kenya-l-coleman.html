  <title>Hierarchy of Love: The Guide to Help You Get the Best of Someone&#39;s Love - Kenya L. Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is one of many on the subject of Love. What makes this book special is that it has a specific goal to help you get the best of someone&#39;s love. Not everyone has loved to their greatest potential but it doesn&#39;t mean they cannot reach that desired place of euphoric love.  Those feelings have to be inspired.  That responsibility falls on the mate who has to bring those feelings out. When it comes to relationships, no matter who is right or wrong, the only thing that is really relevant is; How do you make your man or your woman feel about you? That&#39;s it! With that bottom line in mind the burden of inspiration is an individual one.  This book intends to teach you how to inspire your mate to love you like you want to be loved." />
