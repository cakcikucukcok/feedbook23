  <title>The Mold Code Handbook - Darryl Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Its a four letter word and its everywhere  its mold. And, while we cant live without it, we have to know how to live with it. For instance, in nature, mold plays a key role, but problems begin when mold runs amuck. This is when it can begin affecting things like our homes, health, and even agricultural crops. So, what can be done?
Here, we expose mold right where it lives. Thats right. We provide you with an insiders view into the world of mold and share practical tips and solutions to common mold problems. We suggest ways to comply with ordinances and show you how to protect not only your loved ones, but the places where you live and work. We help you to identify areas that have suffered water damage, but do not display easily identifiable signs.
In fact, this book was produced as the result of a recent scientific study that proves the authors research and findings, linking childhood asthma to three molds that are specific to water-damaged buildings.
And, since mold affects just about everyone and everything, this book is for anyone  parents, pregnant women, homeowners, architects and engineers, building contractors and managers, municipalities and local government, real estate professionals, mold inspectors, doctors, lawyers and more." />
