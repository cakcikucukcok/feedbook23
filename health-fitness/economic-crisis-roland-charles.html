  <title>Economic Crisis - Roland Charles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Economic Crisis is an interesting little book. More like a guide meant for people facing difficulties due to the consequences of the current economic and financial crisis, it briefly and simply explains how the crisis came about, why conforming and agreeing with conventional wisdom supplied by the media is harmful to your health, and why the first step toward a rewarding, productive career is to find out what your purposes in life have been and what your new purposes are.
Today, as from time immemorial, the media thrives by peddling bad news. Its what sells. The big story since 2008 has been the economic crisis. Banks and investment firms have failed; credit is tight; and layoffs are the order of every day. In this environment, and with bad news spreading like wildfire, how can a person retain the necessary confidence to get a job or keep his or her current one?
I am a believer in self-reliance and responsibility. Nobody I know who is in a bad situation is a total victim of circumstance. They all had a chance to do something to improve their lives, but failed to do so. Why would anyone waste the opportunities life throws at him or her and sink into the deepest, coldest depths of inability and irresponsibility?
As an observer of human behavior and a curious dilettante in all matters political and economic, I attempt to explain in this book what the current economic crisis is, how it came about, and what each of us can do to remain productive and happy. Many of the concepts in this book have been taken from my understanding of other authors interesting material that Ive had the chance to study and test. To find out whether or not the concepts and exercises suggested here are effective, I suggest that you just try them and see for yourself. This book is not an attempt to convert anyone to any particular religious or philosophic doctrine, but a synthesis of my understanding of these concepts put into a work that can serve as a practical guide to someone who is worried about the economic crisis." />
