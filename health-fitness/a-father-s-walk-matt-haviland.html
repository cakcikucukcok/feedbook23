  <title>A Father’S Walk - Matt Haviland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are over twenty-five million children growing up in America today without their biological father in the home, and single parents account for approximately 37 percent of all households. Yet, there is still a huge lack of Christian-based ministries for single parents, especially when it comes to the dads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based off of his experience as a single dad himself, Matt Haviland shares with us his journey of joy, trials, and grace that has brought him to this point in single father ministry. He tells in dramatic detail the testimony of how Jesus not only rescued and redeemed him from a destructive lifestyle, but how God has given him the ability to lead and guide single dads along the way and become a great dad as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Fathers Walk is not just another self-help book. It is a tool, resource, and inspiration written by someone who is in the trenches every single daya man who knows the love only a father can have for his child, the daily struggles of being a single dad, and the unimaginable grace that our Savior bestows upon those who call upon Him. This is a must-have for any single dad looking to grow as a father and in their walk with the Lord!&lt;/p&gt;" />
