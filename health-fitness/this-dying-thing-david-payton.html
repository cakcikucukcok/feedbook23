  <title>This Dying Thing - David Payton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The inspiration of this book came from the death of my
mother, Frances Edith Nix  Tolliver. She died February 19th, 2007.  She was born April 24th, 1920, I was fortunate enough to have her 56 years of my life.  We are not raised to die, we are raised to live, even though the plot from mankind is like they would do sheep, cows or chickens  although
you are cared for to a certain degree, you are not going to make it out of this world alive.  My thought on this is, that if
we were raised to die, there would probably be more tragedy, probably be more destruction and chaos, and then again maybe not. I also agree that because there are enormous amounts of people, and quite a few that would like to run the world a certain way, we will never unite to a calm and peace that can exist given the right circumstances." />
