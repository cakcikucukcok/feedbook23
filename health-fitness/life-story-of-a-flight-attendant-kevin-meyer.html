  <title>Life Story of a Flight Attendant - Kevin Meyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story of a flight attendant who works very hardsometimes more than forty hours a weekfor one of the biggest airlines in the world. The stories written here are mostly from her day-to-day life and work. However, the characters in this book are not real, and any resemblance to real persons is purely coincidental.
She grew up as one of the five girls in their house. She was the prettiest among them, and that caused certain jealousy among other sisters and sometimes became a problem for her. All the sisters had one common talent that they shared. Constantly and perfectly lying was an everyday, natural behavior. Sometimes, they had to lie to survive the moment or to get what they needed or wanted. 
When she was growing, her biggest problem was her father. Her father, for some reason unbeknownst to her, was much more rough on her than on the other sisters. He was a ruthless and violent man. He had no mercy when he began to beat his daughters. She had never known why she was being punished, and he never knew how much it hurt her. 
This propelled her to other mennot for any other purpose but to catch the opportunity to punish those men just like her father punished her. She did this in the form of taking their money, lying to them, leaving them with empty hope, cheating, and if it took having sex with them, she did not hesitate. It was not for her own pleasure of sex, but her pleasure was coming from her attempt to punish the men. Some of her behavior may be perceived as immoral, unethical, or not acceptable; however, for her, any transgression had a specific mission to punish men. 
Every time she accomplished this, it was a slap to her fathers face, or she was preventing his slap to her face. Many of these actions were placed in her subconscious, driving her without thinking and planning. She does it just because she can do it.
Her job and lifestyle gave her ample opportunity to find a man and achieve her goal of punishing them. She used her beauty, charm, sex appeal, and whatever else it took to get her next prey. Sometimes she took money from them, sometimes she had sex with them, and sometimes she led them to a finish line that never existed." />
