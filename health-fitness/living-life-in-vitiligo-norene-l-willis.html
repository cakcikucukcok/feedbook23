  <title>Living Life in Vitiligo - Norene L. Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Back in the late 90s I was singing in the church choirs giving God all my talents and gifts.  I would see people visiting the church who had Vitiligo, I would go up to them introduce myself and give them a hug.  Because I know what theyve been going through.  People always are approach me,  asking  me how was I able to walk around without the makeup on.  I let them know that Its  God working in me, Hes the one whose keeping me, Protecting us.  We cant do anything without him. Once when I was at the YMCA and a lady run from behind her counter telling me about her Vitiligo and how she cant deal with it.  One day a total stranger approached me telling me about his problem with dating and Vitiligo.  I have a friend who has a neighbor who both her and her husband have Vitiligo. Im always encouraging people, letting them know they can make it. Once I was at the gas station, getting my inspection ticker and an older man was just setting there. I never saw him even look up at me, he just started talking to me, saying, my daughter in law has what you have, I said whats that.  He said that, I said oh Vitiligo?  He said, my son wants to take his wife out to dinner and to a movie, but she wont come out of the house.
There are people all over the world who are struggling, refusing to remove their makeup, hiding in their closets, behind closed doors because theyre so afraid of what people will say about them. It wasnt until I started to sell my book when all the pieces started to come together.  It was all the feed back that I was getting back from the people who had read my book that made me realize that all the pain that I went through was not for me, but it was for your pain.  The Lord had told me to write this book two years ago. The Lord was preparing me some forty-two years ago.  This book was wrote for you, and your pain not mine.  The Lord has brought me through all of this to help somebody else. It never was about me, its always been about you and your pain. This book was written as a tool to help other people who don&#39;t understand what Vitiligo is, or what do people go through. God took me through all of this for forty-two years just to allow me to write this book. To help other people who are still going through all the physical and mental pain. It really doesn&#39;t matter what the illness is. This book can help start the beginning process of I can make it. By taking one day at a time. Pray to God for healing the mind, the spirit, the heart, your esteem, your life. We all must start somewhere, sometime. Start today. God can do anything but fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
God Bless you
