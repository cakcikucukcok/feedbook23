  <title>Crossroads: An American Case Study - Dr. Gilbert Singletary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in the projects, Dr. Singletary knows a thing or two about crossroads and making right and wrong decisions. The son of sharecroppers, he was the first of seven children to graduate from college and redefine excellence and success in his family. Overcoming the constant exposure to drugs, violence, and death, Dr. Singletary has amassed an impressive academic and professional portfolio. As a distinguished professor, author, entrepreneur, and international speaker, Dr. Singletary&amp;rsquo;s credentials also include a Ph.D., JD, MBA, MSW and a host of other professional and academic honors.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Using his life experiences and the collective experiences of others, Dr. Singletary created &lt;em&gt;Crossroads&lt;/em&gt; as a blueprint for success. &lt;em&gt;Crossroads&lt;/em&gt; is a roadmap that teaches you how to navigate life&amp;rsquo;s challenges while building a future of success. &lt;em&gt;Crossroads&lt;/em&gt; takes you on a journey into the lives of ordinary people who had to face extraordinary circumstances. Learn how to navigate life&amp;rsquo;s ups and downs and how to create a life of success while living in despair. Learn first-hand what it&amp;rsquo;s like to lose millions of dollars because of bad decision. Discover how it feels to be 19 years old facing the death penalty.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We all encounter crossroads in our lives. Crossroads are the intersections where opportunity meets adversity. These critical moments define our character and determine our future. One decision can lead to a lifetime of prosperity or a lifetime of pain. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if there was a blueprint for orchestrating life&amp;rsquo;s trials and tribulations? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if you could see into your future before you made critical decisions? What if I told you, you can?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Welcome to The Crossroads&lt;/p&gt;" />
