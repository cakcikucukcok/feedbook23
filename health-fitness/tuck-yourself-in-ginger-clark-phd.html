&lt;p&gt;Learning how to self-soothe, re-center, or tuck yourself in during difficult moments is an important skill that few of us learned to do in an optimal way as we grew up. Dr. Ginger Clark has written a fascinating approach on how to develop this crucial skill for your own moments of discomfort, or to help those you care about. Her approach combines her background as a therapist, her knowledge of body-mind-spirit methods, and her vulnerability and courage as a human being who has worked hard for many years to find self-soothing and re-centering steps that are effective and do-able for people from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;
