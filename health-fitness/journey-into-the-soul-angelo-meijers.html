  <title>Journey into the Soul - Angelo Meijers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a treasure for every truth seeker, and I believe our shared love of this quest has brought us here. There is so much we dont yet know, but our curiosity and wonder urge us to go further and not settle for easy conclusions and convictions. We ponder the deep questions of existence and the meaning of it all, even asking if there is a purpose to life. This book takes us on a unique journey into the heart of our innermost being. We start this adventure by recognizing that only through the soul experience can we come to know who we truly are and, in doing so, unravel the secrets of life. As we walk together, Ill tell you what I see from my perspective, and youll see what unfolds before your inner eyes. Step by step, well develop a mutual understanding and a deeper love of truth, as the darkness that clouds the mind and confuses the intuition gradually gives way to the light of consciousness. Through the eyes of the heart, well catch a glimpse of the eternal nameless one who never dies. And when we feel the light of our truth, well be reunited with our true essence; and through this sacred marriage, a little piece of heaven will come to Earth." />
