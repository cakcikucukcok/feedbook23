  <title>Catch Your Breath - Linda Spalla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot; &lt;p&gt;&quot;&quot;One of the meditations from Catch Your Breath cited in Oprah Magazine&quot;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you have chosen to be a caregiver or were hijacked by circumstances, Catch Your Breath, a series of touching meditations by Linda Spalla, will become a wisp of sanity and a day-to-day stabilizer. Spalla retraces an eight month care-giving journey with her mother, captured in raw, candid images, truly becoming a walk in her shoes. What started as a thirty-days-to-live commitment of care in her home turned into an unexpected eight months of never-ending responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will feel a kinship with the roller coaster of emotions; from anger, confusion, surprise, resentment, guilt and ambivalence, to finally relief, recovery and celebration. You will learn through the various vignettes some refreshingly practical information on such topics as finding sitters, managing medicine, dealing with sibling rivalry, contracting with Hospice, moving to assisted living, doing will preparation and other legalities as well as funeral planning. You will laugh; you will sob; your heart will soar; your heart will break. You will find solace, encouragement and inspiration for one of lifes most daunting challenges. But especially, you will discover your best self, emerging stalwart, strong and forged by the fire of your caregiving experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Give yourself a gift of renewal and Catch Your Breath.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;" />
