  <title>The Power of Labels - Marsy Beron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;Gestalt psychotherapist Beron, in her debut self-help book, examines the positive and negative impacts of being socially labeled and how such labels shape one&#39;s feelings, thoughts and behavior.
&quot;The power of labels is like an invisible pressure...which intercepts our thoughts and actions, distorts beyond recognition the mirror...and makes us vulnerable to the pain of the past and the fear of the future,&quot; asserts the author in the book&#39;s foreword. Although people may acquire labels at any age, Beron contends that most first appear in childhood and come from such sources as classmates, teachers, parents and friends. She briefly describes the Gestalt theory of psychotherapy, which emphasizes personal responsibility, and uses it as a basis for exploring ways that people may assume positive control over their lives. Beron reminds readers that people may be labeled in direct and indirect ways, with or without cruel intent, due to name-calling, nicknames or comparison to others. What&#39;s important, then, is how people believe such characterizations and how they become a part of their identities. In turn, those conceptions of identity influence people&#39;s thoughts and habits and may deter them from changing their lives.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;A helpful, hopeful and thorough guide that invites readers to change the images in their mirrors.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
 KIRKUS Review 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;In The Power of Labels, a self-help book with an encouraging tone, Marsy Beron discusses a range of ways people label themselves or are labeled by others, and the detrimental psychological effects this can have on children and adults.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Through a series of personal stories, Beron focuses on how labels are created for others by parents, coworkers, and spouses, and how that can influence people&#39;s perceptions of themselves and their environments. She relies on many anecdotal experiences, not only from her own life but also from her clients and group therapy work, to offer advice.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
