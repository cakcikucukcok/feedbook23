  <title>Breaking Generational Chains: A Woman&#39;s Guide to Freedom - Patricia Barrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whitney Houston was one of the greatest singers ever. God blessed her with a voice unlike anyone before her. Whitney had the world, but something else had Whitney.&amp;nbsp; Whitney was chained to addiction.&amp;nbsp; But what caused it? Why? Why would someone who had the world in her hands need to numb herself though drugs? What was going on inside Whitney Houston that led to her being found overdosed and dead in a Beverly Hills Hilton bathtub?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Though there could be many arguments, one likely, but overlooked reason may be found in obscure articles online. At one time in her career, Whitney Houston&amp;rsquo;s father sued her for one hundred million dollars. As part of the justification for the lawsuit, her father said that he helped get a case for marijuana possession wiped from Whitney&amp;rsquo;s record. Her father allegedly pleaded with her from a national news show, &amp;ldquo;Get yourself together and give me the money you owe me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whether Mr. Houston believed that getting a marijuana case dismissed was worth one hundred million dollars or not, it seems clear that a father willing to sue his daughter for one hundred million dollars and embarrass her on national TV has some issues. Issues he likely passed down to that daughter. Issues, it now seems, Whitney passed down to her own daughter. Three years after Whitney&amp;rsquo;s mysterious and tragic death, Bobbi Kristina Houston, Whitney&amp;rsquo;s 22-year-old daughter, also died, intoxicated in a bathtub, just as her mother Whitney had died.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moreover, both Whitney and Bobbi Kristina were attracted to and involved with alleged addicts&amp;mdash;Bobby Brown, Whitney&amp;rsquo;s husband, and Nick Gordon, Bobbi&amp;rsquo;s boyfriend. Why?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The answer this book will suggest is that long-standing violations of God&amp;rsquo;s principles for living have contributed to a psychological, social, mental, emotional and spiritual phenomenon best described as generational chains or curses, which have profound negative effects on families and individuals for years beyond the life of the offending person. These chains have the power to destroy even the greatest personal achievements because they are spiritually-based issues that cannot be resolved with physical or material solutions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The goal for readers of this book is that they would be spared the chains that plagued Whitney Houston and her daughter. This book, written primarily for women, but certainly applicable to men as well will give readers the power and knowledge to: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Identify and combat the effects of generational chains&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Make sense of your life and life choices&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Value your identity and purpose in accordance with God&amp;rsquo;s plan&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Follow a scriptural path to spiritual, emotional, and social healing&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Create a new pattern of generational blessings and wholeness&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Sustain a life of spiritual power and success&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The effects of generational chains can be broken if the right Biblical principles are accessed and applied. You do not need to be victims of the sins of your fathers and mothers. The Bible affords answers to forge a new path in life, break generational chains, and replace them with generational blessings and favor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
