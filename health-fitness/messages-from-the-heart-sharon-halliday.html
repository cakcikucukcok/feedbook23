  <title>Messages from the Heart - Sharon Halliday</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all seek the same things: financial security and freedom, meaningful work, harmonious relationships, and good health and wellbeing. But even more, we especially seek inner peace, fulfilment, and happiness. Yet whether these things are tangible or intangible, material or spiritual, attaining them can nevertheless be a challenge. Where can we find those aha moments that show us our possibilities and potentials and help us embrace that which we seek?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Messages from the Heart&lt;/em&gt;, author and angel intuitive Sharon Halliday answers thirty-nine of your life questions, and she addresses all these topics and more. Originally appearing as Ask Sharon columns in her local newspaper, this collection of real-life questions from real people provides answers inspired by some of the best self-help principles and philosophies from around the globe which Sharon herself has tried and tested. Sharon also draws from her angel and oracle cards as well as from her Reiki expertise to channel meaningful, poignant, yet gentle adviceadvice with the potential to change lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether youve never picked up a self-help book before or are an avid fan, and whether you live in country Australia or metropolitan New York City, Sharon Hallidays quirky little book of positivity might just hold the answers youre looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Sharons writing is a giftwise, insightful, often funny, illuminating and transformative.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
