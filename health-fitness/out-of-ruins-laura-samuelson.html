      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Out of Ruins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is the raw and transparent account of a couples journey to piece their broken marriage back together after sexual sin and adultery left them in devastation. This compelling journey will bring you hope, and equip you with practical gear, necessary to successfully make the trek to a restored marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura addresses the battle that plays out in her mind as she strives to move away from the shambles of her heart.

These resolute and life-giving principles shaped the course of their marriage from that of wreckage, to a strong foundation of love.&lt;/p&gt;

Whether gleaning truths for your own marriage or for the healing of someone else, Out of Ruins will call you back to review the heart-healing directives tucked inside.&lt;/p&gt;" />
