Seeking answers from the motivational speaker . . .
SST, really I feel Im not worthy to be here, she spoke softly again, displaying a reluctance to speak out. I immediately got interested! From experience, such people have interesting stories that will make my day. 
My sister, dont worry, you have come where your problems will be attended to. I was cajoling her to speak out! And please, I didnt get your name, or you dont feel like telling me? I said. 
Its not like that, SST! Its just that I dont think I should say what I want to say. She was shying away. I was right. She didnt want her name to be mentioned, theres a story all right!
She came back reluctantly.
OK. SST, my name is Joan, she said.
Joan like hell!
No problem, I can use that name. Names are like ages. They really dont count on my show because you hardly get the true dose, all the same I just needed it for the reference. 
OK, Joan, whats the issue? Let me see your steps, the floor is all yours now. I decided to spur her. I havent got all day even if she was my only caller. 
Joan, lets hear you before our shot time is up, and we might just miss you for life. I was pushing her.
That seemed to wake her, and from then, she started coming out like a canary. When something is bottled up for so long inside someone and it wants to spurt out, a small nod will collapse the whole balloon. 
SST, you see, I never knew my life will drain to this level. I was not brought up to be like this. I had a good family upbringing, nice parents that wanted the best for me. It was not meant to be like this for me. I bet I was left astray by the company I made in school.
Thats it, she is talking now!
You cant put it down once you start reading . . ." />
