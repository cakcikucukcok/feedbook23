  <title>The Creating Copowerment® Workbook - Lani Kwon Ma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Creating CoPOWERment Workbook: Embracing the Power of Positive Psychology, Healing Stories and Explorations to Create the Life You Want encourages readers to explore choices, visualize outcomes, and set priorities. This workbook is informal and informative, never preachy. It provides readers with the shared true-life stories of past Creating CoPOWERment clients and body-mind-spirit practitioners, balanced with the scientific results of positive psychology studies conducted over the past thirty years or more in the areas of optimism, self-compassion, goal-setting, meaningful work, and success. Thought-provoking, hands-on explorations at the end of each chapter support readers in discovering their motivations and ideals in planning step-by-step changes for better living.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Discover what motivates you to use your strengths to create the life you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Learn how your unexamined thoughts and beliefs hold you back from achieving your goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Transform obstacles into lessons and markers of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Align with like-minded-hearted-souled allies, organizations, and communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Find out what your life purpose really is and step-by-step how to get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating CoPOWERment is a phrase the author coined to describe the empowering interactions that take place when people who are going through life transitions come together in groups or partner one-on-one. People who have participated in Creating CoPOWERment have reported that they are able to identify better life options when they have an opportunity to share their experiences, beliefs, and resources with others.&lt;/p&gt;" />
