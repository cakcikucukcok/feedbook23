  <title>Just for You: The Fundamentals - Steven R. Lewis II</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s growing up. He&amp;#39;s not a baby anymore. Look at him, strong, handsome, inquisitive, and curious. Before you know it, he will be entering into a world that can be confusing and unforgiving. Maybe he has already ventured out into the world and hit some rough patches. Perhaps you feel that he is gone too far ever to come back.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With what tools do you wish he were equipped? With what tools do you wish you were equipped that you could have passed on to him? What words can you give him now to shed light upon his path? What can you tell him now to keep him from going down the wrong path?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are the same questions that all of us will ask, have asked before, or are currently asking.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just For You: The Fundamentals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the first book in an ongoing series written by Pop of&lt;em&gt; JourneyVerbage&lt;/em&gt;. It is inspired by his desire to share experiences and principles with his sons that would set a firm foundation for them to grow into manhood. This first installment of the Just For You series is a resource packed with tools to help build, grow, transform, challenge, and mature boys of all ages.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you are a young man, a son, a mentor, teacher, professor, administrator, student, youth leader, member of the clergy, government official, single parent, adoptive parent, grandparent, legal guardian, stepparent, foster parent, Godparent, expecting parent, a new parent, experienced parent, a distant parent, or whatever you may be, this book has something in it just for you!&lt;/p&gt;" />
