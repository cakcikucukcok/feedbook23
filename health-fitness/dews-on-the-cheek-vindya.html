      <meta name="description" content="Dews on the Cheek is a collection of poems by Vindya Ayyar. It is a reflection of emotions and the various turmoil that the mind goes through when we love someone truly. The depiction shows that love is above all, and feelings are common for everyone. Many a times, people dont express their love to their loved one maybe due to shyness, dont know how to, or taking the other person for granted, or simply being too lazy. These poems are an attempt to enable one to understand how a loving heart feels. 
Loving a person may sound easy but proving it and showing it is not everyones cup of tea. Because I love you is the most misused and misunderstood words in lifes dictionary. At times, he / she could be a good person however may not be the right one for you. But love masks all, and heart beats faster for the special one. This book says more about the emotions when the heart and mind dont want to sync. 
It also tries to release the feelings of love &amp; anger of a true lover and about common issues like womans day, Generation Z etc," />
