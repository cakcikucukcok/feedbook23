  <title>THE REVELATION OF WHY - Nathaniel F Frazier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My name is Mr. Nathaniel F. Frazier and I have made it my mission to bring forth the balance of What Is and the Things That Be. For this book is the initial foundation of Revelation Why Education. I was created to help open the minds and eyes of those that desire to positively effect this world and beyond through utilizing and balancing the energies that we were created with. In order to keep your thoughts balanced you must first balance your minds thoughts between the negative character weaknesses and your positive traits. Once there is an equilibrium or balance of these energies they will attract more like energies which will force change to appear right before your eyes. I ask that you join me no matter where you live in the world, let us agree to set our unified intention to bring about world peace, unity and love for all being that be. Let us agree to set our intention to balance out the energies in this world by meditating, praying taking a moment of silence and thinking about closing the portals that have brought in the unbalanced energy waves of negative forces at 12:00pm noon time Monday through Friday for at least 3 months.&amp;nbsp; Agree to bring in more positive forces, while helping the negative forces that want to leave exit in peace to their own realm. Let us also agree to help educate as many people as we can about mental warfare that goes on in the minds of many people. I help you discover the origin of &amp;ldquo;negative character weaknesses&amp;rdquo; through the Revelation of Why and Revelation Why Education and teach you to overcome them (your own negative weaknesses, and the weaknesses of others affecting your life). The Revelation of Why is the result of my own pursuit. I have a Certification in Neuro-Linguistic Programming, served in the Military for 5 years, a Youth Services officer for the State of Tennessee for two and a half years, an Extradition Agent transporting fugitives nationwide for seven and a half years and a Sheriff&amp;rsquo;s Deputy for over 8 years. Throughout my life, I have tried to learn from my mistakes. Well, it seems that since I kept making decisions that I was not happy with or could not stick to, it was time to figure out &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo;. In addition, this is what brought about the &amp;ldquo;Revelation of Why&amp;rdquo;. There was a time when my ex-wife and I went through a lot of miscommunication especially when her son was murdered. I did not know what to say to a grieving wife and mother. She was trusting in the Lord to bring her through somehow. It was I that could not continue to bare the miscommunication between her and I. So, after getting divorced I asked God to give me some answers and that is when I was supplied with The Revelation of Why. I asked how can I communicate with anyone that is grieving? You and other humans were created similar, yet totally different beings. The best way that you can effectively communicate with this being is to speak to him or her using their own concepts that are in alignment with their own inner belief systems. Try to get them to write down or express positive trigger words or positive character traits that are used in similar fashion as affirmations. The only difference with these affirmations or trigger words is the fact that they are a product of their own intellect and thought concept that should help to trigger positive impulses stimulating the brain to override the negative emotions. I thank the Creator for giving me insight to the information in this book. It was a profound help to understand why people do what they do.&amp;nbsp; Understanding &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo; is the key to the whole battle. That is because, if you know the why at least you can have an easier time moving forward. Remember you don&amp;rsquo;t have to accept the why, just knowing is half the battle. The rest is up to you and how you respond to the why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
