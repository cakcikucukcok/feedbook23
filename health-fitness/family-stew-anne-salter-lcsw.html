  <title>Family Stew - Anne Salter Lcsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We each have a personal narrative about our life that incorporates stories within a larger whole. One or more of these stories may reveal roots of traumas or life-changing events that have impacted how we define ourselvestraumas or events that may affect our relationships today. In &lt;i&gt;Family Stew&lt;/i&gt;, author &lt;b&gt;Anne Salter&lt;/b&gt; shows how we are created emotionally and demonstrates how we often form dysfunctional belief systems and relationships from legacies of relationships with family, religion, school, and other early experiences.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Salter presents a full examination of the relationship with our individual self, from the time it first develops in family relationships and as it proceeds into all patterns of animate and inanimate relationships. She includes insight into forming associations with other people, ourselves, and our sexuality, as well as forming relationships with inanimate items, such as money, home, work, religion or spirituality, and government and politics. She also helps the reader to identify dysfunctional behaviors, beliefs and patterns of functioning.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Family Stew&lt;/i&gt; includes real stories of people and the ways in which their adult relationship choices directly reflect their childhood experiences. Salter presents a guide and tool to help you learn how to reclaim a healthy relationship with your individual self and with all of the other connections in the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
