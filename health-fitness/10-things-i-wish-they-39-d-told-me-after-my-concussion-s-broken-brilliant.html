      <meta name="description" content="Have you had a concussion? A mild TBI? If you&#39;ve recently had a head injury, you&#39;re not alone. Millions of Americans have a brain  injury every year. Sports, falls, assaults, auto accidents, and more all contribute. To take care of yourself and get better, there&#39;s a lot you need to know.   What can you expect? Why do you feel so weird? Why are you getting so angry? How do you take care of yourself? How long will it take for your symptoms to clear up? Will this fatigue ever end?  This &quot;beginner&#39;s guide to concussion&quot; gives you an insider&#39;s view of what it&#39;s like, what you can expect, what you might experience, and why you feel the way you do. Written by a multiple mild TBI survivor with decades of recovery experience, &quot;10 Things I Wish They&#39;d Told Me After My Concussion(s)&quot; fills in the blanks of this puzzling condition and talks about anger, fatigue, frustration, the neurological basis of your situation, and more.
