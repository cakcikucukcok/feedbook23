  <title>The Year of Living Happy - Alli Worthington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would your life be different if you were just a bit happier every day for a year? What would you do to enjoy life just a little more day by day? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your first step toward increased happiness with &lt;em&gt;The Year of Living Happy: Finding Contentment and Connection in a Crazy World &lt;/em&gt;by Alli Worthington.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do your best to live life well&amp;mdash;you work hard to be present in the moment, take care of the people in your life, knock it out of the park at work and home. And yet somehow, you still have days (perhaps more than you&#39;d like to admit) where you&#39;re simultaneously stressed &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bored, and you wonder if you even know how to be happy. Is happiness a worthy goal? Does happiness matter to God, or does He only care about holier things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alli Worthington gets it. As a wife, mother of five boys, author, speaker, and entrepreneur, she knows a thing or two about being busy, stressed, and happy in the midst of a crazy world! Over the years, she&#39;s seen how happiness gets a bad rap in Christian circles, and now she is standing up to shout the good news from the roof (or the internet, as the case may be): You are allowed to be happy! Yes, you! You can be happy right now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get rid of the common Christian misconception that happiness is somehow not holy, and grasp God&amp;rsquo;s intention for His children&amp;mdash;that happiness and holiness can coexist for a beautiful life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join Alli for &lt;em&gt;The Year of Living Happy: Finding Contentment and Connection in a Crazy World&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and find the roots of your happiest life yet! With 100 inspirational devotions, beautiful art, and journaling pages throughout, this gorgeous devotional offers practical ways to make your life happier day by day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t miss the great big beautiful adventure God has for you right in your own life. Let this be &lt;em&gt;The Year of Living Happy&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;" />
