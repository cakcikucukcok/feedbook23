  <title>Chef Interrupted - Trevis Gleason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In April 2001, Trevis Gleason was a chef on the rise. Then one day he suffered a stroke-like episode and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He lost everything – his job, his marriage, even his perceived persona. Surveying the ruins of his former life, he saw an opportunity to fulfill a long-postponed dream: he put life in Seattle on hold and moved to west Kerry. Renting a cottage in ‘The Town’, and tapping into a profound passion for food, he learned his life, loves and even dreams weren’t lost – just waiting to be rediscovered. Trevis surmounts physical setbacks and cultural differences with self-effacing wit, serving up life’s lessons and his favourite recipes one tasty chapter after another. This is a story not of survival, but of living life to the full. Trevis’s inspirational humour in the face of his changed life is sure to have you coming back for seconds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
