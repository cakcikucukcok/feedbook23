  <title>The Master Guide to Food Safety - Matthew Okiroro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost every day, we come in contact with and eat foods of various categories and types. Eating and staying healthy and strong requires that the foods we eat are safe. The keys to food safety lie in handling, storage, and controlling time and temperature throughout the flow of food, and practicing good personal hygiene to prevent contamination and cross-contamination. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The main food safety concern for any food service establishment or restaurant and the general public is the risk of food borneillness outbreak, which may cost lives, huge amount of medical bills, and the disruption of business flow and family functions that are embarrassing to everyone.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Therefore, it is important to follow proper procedures that focus on these areas as you walk through the road of eliminating or reducing pathogens (bacteria that make people sick) in your foods and environment to a safe level.
