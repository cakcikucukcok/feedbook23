  <title>The Coast Guard Gentleman and the High School Girl - Charlie Alone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story of my life and the boy I have carried in my heart since 1963.	
At the end of writing this book, it was February 14, 2015, at exactly 9:00 p.m. I had not had contact with him by text since January 22, 2015.
The person I am is to always think the worse, as I did in 1963, not thinking he would come back to me. I thought this story had ended once more.
On February 16 of this year, I received another text from him.
We exchanged a few, then he was off again. On the seventeenth, I texted something to him with no response on his part.
Today on the nineteenth, I am still waiting to hear from him. I will not contact him again until he gets back to me. If he does, that might be my second book." />
