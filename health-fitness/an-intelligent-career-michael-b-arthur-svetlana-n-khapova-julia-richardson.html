  <title>An Intelligent Career - Michael B. Arthur, Svetlana N. Khapova, Julia Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written by three career experts, &lt;em&gt;An Intelligent Career &lt;/em&gt;is a playbook for the modern knowledge worker, providing a complete guide that will allow workers to take a composite, dynamic view of a life&#39;s work in the 21st century.
&quot;Knowledge work&quot; is fundamental in today&#39;s economy. It is the basis for long-term success in the global economy and it drives the collective brainpower through which goods and services are delivered. And today, knowledge work requires much more than a college degree: it means understanding the changing nature of work and employment, and the processes through which knowledge is generated, transferred, and applied. It means understanding new career possibilities, more dynamic work arrangements, and the growing demand for knowledge work around the globe. It means navigating work life with an authenticity that replaces any straightforward loyalty to a single employer, and instead calls for better understanding of the self, collaborators, clients, and customers.
Now in paperback, &lt;em&gt;An Intelligent Career &lt;/em&gt;provides clear guidance on how to take charge of your own destiny, seek continuous learning, collaborate with others, recognize and act on fresh opportunities, determine when it is time to move on, and much more." />
