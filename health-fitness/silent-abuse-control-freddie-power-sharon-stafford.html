  <title>Silent Abuse, Control - Freddie Power, Sharon Stafford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you searching for understanding, guidance, and release from the grip of a loved ones verbal beatings and never-ending mind games? Have you constantly been made to feel devalued, incapable, and ignored? At times, do you feel like you are living with a caring loved one who, without warning, rages into a monster? This book can help provide many of the answers youve been seeking.
Controlling behavior is a very real form of abuse that verbally, mentally, and psychologically batters a person into a state of defeat, virtually erasing any self-esteem or confidence. It is silent abuse because it is the most undetectable, common, and misunderstood form of abuse that exists today. Its affects are so devastating because it ever so slowly creeps in, striking unexpectedly from the mouth of a loved one and emotionally paralyzing a person, over time destroying all hope and joy for life.
The first step in dealing with this abuse is to recognize it in every form it takes. Learn by example through relatable, attention-grabbing stories based on facts, told from the point of view of people who have experienced this specific type of abuse. These personal stories expose the common behavior and characteristics of controlling abusers. Abuse doesnt care who you are; what your age, ethnicity, or social class isit doesnt discriminate. It is important to understand that abuse in any form is never deserved or acceptable.
These inspiring stories will give you hope and leave you feeling encouraged through the true accounts of people who have emerged from a dark pit of despair as they were guided to the source of needed strength to prevail. It is time to feel encouraged knowing that there is a very real possibility of life and more abundantly where you may not think it could exist. A life without control and verbal abuse is possible and accessible!" />
