  <title>Looking for Happiness, Loss of the Big Money and Surviving - Ludmila Chorekchan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is an exciting story about how the rich family estate was left without any regret by one sister and lost between the fingers without any responsibility by another sister. But nothing bad could happened at all, if the people
from this story would really knew themselves, knew their weak points and aware of their psychological problems! So, I tried to display it through the actions of these people, that everybody could not only understand rationally
the important psychological problems, which push us to our troubles, but emotionally also, what is very important, feeling pain of these people, being really upset to their wrong behavior and glad to right one, because then we learn better and remember forever! It is also very important to know when we want to be happy and when we are not, or when we are the victims, or when we are attacking others, or when we are loosing
everything, going down, or when we are just living today!
This story is very consonant to our time, when we also lost a lot and must fix our life how it was before! Even more, it is my modern psychological version of the famous play A Streetcar Named Desire, Tennessee Williams,
which was published right after The Second World War was over, time close to our days, when terrors of the war were staying yet in memory
of the people, leaving its traces on the ways of the life, and where serious psychological problems were expressed especially impressively, through pain,tears and sufferings. But in my story I tried to do moreto display the real reasons of the psychological problems, what we are usually missing, step by step discovering wrong thoughts and wrong doings, which led that people to their troubles. And as resultreward to all of us: happy ending, because the
reasons of all troubles were discovered; but to discover means to understand and to understand psychological problems is to get rid of them and to be cured! I tried to write about all those serious matters in an easy entertainment
way, that everybody, who will read my story, would enjoy it!" />
