  <title>A Cheerleader Romance - Klare Sullivan Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By flooding us daily with unsettling news at home and abroad, the news media can sometimes defeat the optimism that should be our right to enjoy. Yet, life goes on in spite of an unknown future, and once in a while stories of humor and happiness can be found nearby.  Such is &lt;b&gt;Klare Campbells&lt;/b&gt; story of love in a second marriage.  To be a bride again after her first husbands death was a surprise and a shock to family and friends. The adventurous pursuit of this senior lady for a high school cheerleader friend  became the talk of the small town in which she had lived for many years.  Because their story has been such a fun-loving experience, she felt compelled to share it with readers who would like to temporarily escape  from the real world." />
