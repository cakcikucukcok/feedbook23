  <title>Burn the Damn Cape - Vicki Savini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I know you. You&amp;rsquo;re the one who consistently puts the needs of others before your own. You&amp;rsquo;re accustomed to taking care of others. It&amp;rsquo;s all you&amp;rsquo;ve ever known. It is who you believe you are and where you believe your value comes from. Putting yourself on the backburner is a no- brainer. You snap on your cape to save everyone else and leave little to nothing for yourself. You believe that by doing this, you are serving yourself. Yet, you are truly sabotaging yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years, you&amp;rsquo;ve been told you need to love yourself. That shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be difficult, right? You are a kind, loving, and generous person. If you can love others with such intensity, you certainly should be able to love yourself. But, how the hell do you do that when you&amp;rsquo;re immersed in taking care of everyone else&amp;rsquo;s needs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You begin by looking in the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MIRROR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;First, you become &lt;em&gt;aware&lt;/em&gt; of why you are a rescuer.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Then, you look at your &lt;em&gt;alternatives&lt;/em&gt; to self-sabotage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Finally, you take &lt;em&gt;action&lt;/em&gt; by giving yourself 30-days to heal, honor, and love yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Vicki Savini&amp;rsquo;s no-nonsense guide, you will laugh, cry, and ultimately become empowered. You will learn how to rescue &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; and develop a daily practice to love yourself &lt;em&gt;consistently&lt;/em&gt;. You &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a kind, loving and generous person and it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; feel good to help others, but not at the expense of your own happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vicki&amp;rsquo;s tried-and-true daily practices will heal you and teach you to honor and love yourself, so you can be your very best self. Take the time to finally make a rescue that counts. Rescue yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Vicki Savini has written a much-needed book for anyone looking to finally make their health, inner-peace, and overall well-being a top priority. If you&amp;rsquo;re ready to stop putting everyone else first and start living your very best life, this book is for you!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
