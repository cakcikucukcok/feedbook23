  <title>The Porn Factor - Diane Elaine Roblin-Lee, Melodie Bissell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How was it possible for Diane Roblin-Lee to have been married for 38 years without knowing that her husband, 13 years into the marriage, had begun to molest children?&lt;br /&gt;
The answer lies in the fact that child-molesters are such highly skilled manipulators that they can fool even a mate with whom they live &amp;ndash; and convince a child that keeping the deep dark secret is critically important for both of them. They are usually so addicted to pornography that acting out the taunting perversions of their porn-soaked brains becomes the driving force of their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
Once the fog from the shock, betrayal, and shame of her husband&amp;rsquo;s crimes began to clear, Diane wondered how any young mom could possibly be expected to protect her children from a predator &amp;ndash; if she had lived with one for all those years and not recognized the signs.&lt;br /&gt;
Following her divorce, the sale of her home, and the dismantling of their business, Diane immersed herself in research and emerged with the&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Predator-Proof Your Family Series&lt;/em&gt;, breaking the silence in which predators hide.&amp;nbsp; The publishing of this series of nine booklets is Diane&amp;rsquo;s way of turning her brokenness, and that of her family, into information and protection for other children and other families.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eightfold purpose behind the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Predator-Proof Your Family &lt;/em&gt;Series:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; To help families and guardians recognize danger signs in people who have access to the children in their care&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; To deter people who are fantasizing about molesting a child from acting on their fantasies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; To protect children from molestation through raising awareness on many levels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; To be aware of the new challenges of parenting in the&amp;nbsp; 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; To deepen the understanding of all levels of society affected&amp;nbsp;by the molestation of a child&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; To find healing for victims and families&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; To encourage the kind of justice and community&amp;nbsp;action that prevents potential or convicted predators from initial offending and re-offending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp; To demonstrate to all those who have been molested that we&amp;nbsp;care deeply about what you have endured and, in honor of you,&amp;nbsp;are doing all we can to protect other children from sharing your experience.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Interview with a child molester&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A public health hazard&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Who the heck looks at child pornography?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;From statistics to real people&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Erotica or pornography?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A harmless pacifier?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are you raising a child molester?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why do they do it???&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Women and pornography&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The depths of hell&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The link between child sexual abuse and pornography&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pornography as child sexual abuse&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The Internet - Trojan horse of the 20th Century&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heroes of the day&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Internet deterrents&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Accepting responsibility&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only with a fresh swing of the pendulum to the light will we be able to give our children back their safe streets on which to play in the warm summer evenings. Only then will we be able to predator-proof our families with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
