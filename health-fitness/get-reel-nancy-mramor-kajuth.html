  <title>Get Reel - Nancy Mramor Kajuth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Get Reel&lt;/i&gt; gives you tools to view the media in a completely new way that will create mental, physical, and spiritual health and happiness while you view. In a media-heavy world, you can be the producer of your life and learn how to view TV, movies, and the Internet consciously and stop being influenced by the hypnotic effects of their messages. You will become aware of the ways that viewing media causes hypnosis and how you can break any trance you may have absorbed, replacing it with your own ideas of how you want to live your life. &lt;i&gt;Get Reel&lt;/i&gt; moves you from pursuing goals and ideas that you attempt to fulfill without satisfaction toward the ones that are truly your own. It provides the blueprint on how to:&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; break any ineffective belief or hypnotic trance that you unconsciously absorbed from the media, your family, peers, or any outside influence; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; discover the conscious, effective, fulfilled person that you truly are, free of outside influence;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; learn conscious living skills that will enable you to view each opportunity in your life with full awareness, allowing you to make the best choices;&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; continue to enjoy the entertaining, educational, and fun benefits of your favorite website, TV show, or movie; &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; turn struggles into open pathways to your happiness and success with trance-breaking techniques; and&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; have a great time in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
