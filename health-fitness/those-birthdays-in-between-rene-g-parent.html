  <title>Those Birthdays In-Between - Rene G. Parent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Midmorning an insurance agent from Ohio calls. &quot;I know you are busy,&quot; she says. &quot;I&#39;ll keep it brief.&quot; Ten minutes later, she laments she always wanted to write. Reading of ourselves is what writing is about and her story waits and is as valid.
Weave the everyday routine and those days that aren&#39;t. Perhaps a spring break road trip to Lake Tahoe or celebrating the first dozen years poolside in Sacramento. Or maybe those birthdays in between which introduce new decades while celebrating amid family in Vermont.
Still it&#39;s not what you say, or even write down, rather what others tell themselves as they read alongside. &quot;Write daily of the everyday,&quot; I tell her. &quot;Start with the insurance person calling.&quot; Writing - a conversation we place ourselves within." />
