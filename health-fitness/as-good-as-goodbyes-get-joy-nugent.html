  <title>As Good as Goodbyes Get - Joy Nugent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Joy Nugent left a comfortable life as the wife of a successful orthodontist to follow a calling and vocation. For more than three decades she was a student at the bedside of people who were dying. It is her belief that in order to live a fuller and more meaningful life we need to become more open in our conversations about death and dying. This belief has the potential to lead a person to die with confidence and faith in a cosmic purpose rather than fear of the unknown. &lt;i&gt;As Good as Goodbyes Get&lt;/i&gt; is a bridge from a traditional medical approach to an approach that considers the eternal soul of the person.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Andrew Harvey&lt;/B&gt;, editor of &lt;i&gt;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying by Sogyal&lt;/i&gt;
Rinpoche, internationally acclaimed author, and mystical scholar and teacher.
&lt;P&gt; And I benefitted from having your book, which is written in a very sensitive, sensible way and provided an easy read with very valuable advice. I hope you market it internationally to oncology nurses, oncologists, medical oncology departments, and nursing homes &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Jorge F. Cassir, MD&lt;/B&gt;, An oncologist from New York
&lt;P&gt;There is no greater endorsement I can give of Joy Nugents work than to say when its time for me to make my transition she is someone I would choose to accompany me to the threshold. Joy is a person of deep wisdom, intuition, and grace. She knows how to listen and reflect to others their own truth. The gems shared in As Good as Goodbyes Get help the reader learn what is healing and beneficial for those who are approaching the end of their physical lives. Hope, peace and love are the treasures that can be mined in a good death experience. With compassion and kindness Joy helps people find the path that will lead them home.&lt;/P&gt;
