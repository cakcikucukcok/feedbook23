  <title>25 Years to My Life... - Loutricia Gibbs-Tolbert, Veronda Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What makes a successful life?&amp;nbsp; Is it only money or material things? Maybe you think it is social status or a person&amp;rsquo;s connections.&amp;nbsp; All these are valid. At least, these are what people can see and count as contributors of an individual&amp;rsquo;s success. &amp;nbsp;But did you know that our character is another, and perhaps more important, it is measure of what a person has accomplished?&amp;nbsp; It has been said in so many words that our looks, our gifts and talents, or our skills can elevate us to high places, but a well-developed character helps us keep and sustain our success.&amp;nbsp; Not only does solid character open doors but it can help us identify the right doors to walk through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Loutricia was a star student-athlete, voted best-all-around and homecoming queen her senior year. However, she still could not escape the trauma of a childhood filled with sexual abuse.&amp;nbsp; This eventually caught up with her as a young woman making her own way in the world. She found herself entangled in a pattern of failed relationships and violence in which she ended up accidentally shooting someone. In an instance of self-defense, she found herself standing before a judge pleading for her life. She was facing a 25 -year sentence but only served three years in prison and 12 years of probation. &amp;nbsp;It was in prison that that she accepted her calling into ministry as an evangelist. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a journey with Loutricia as she details how being a person of integrity caused a miracle to happen and revealed how God added 25 years to her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
