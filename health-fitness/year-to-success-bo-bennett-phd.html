  <title>Year To Success - Bo Bennett PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you been promised success if you follow a few quick and dirty &amp;quot;rules&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;secrets&amp;quot; of success? Are you tired of irrelevant analogies that do nothing for you but make you feel inadequate? Have you had enough of highly metaphysical concepts and not enough practical solutions? Have you had your fill of grossly exaggerated claims that try to trick you into thinking success is easy? Are you all &amp;quot;affirmationed&amp;quot; out? You are not alone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Think of success as a game of chance in which you have control over the odds. As you begin to master concepts in personal achievement, you are increasing your odds of achieving success. Year To Success is a full year course in success, designed to be a practical guide to achieving your definition of success. Each day of this course will, through practical application, increase your odds of achieving success. It has been said that one line of wisdom can change your life more than volumes of books. Imagine what hundreds of pages of wisdom can do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Year To Success is perhaps the most complete book on success ever written. It uses my &amp;quot;formula&amp;quot; for success: education + inspiration + action = success. Education: each week starts off with two educational articles and ends with two more educational articles. Inspiration: the third day of the week is a &amp;quot;success biography&amp;quot; on someone I believe is one of the most successful people in history. These success biographies are full of inspiration to help keep your flame for success burning on high. Action: each of the educational articles has one or more action steps associated with it. Taking action and getting results are what this book is all about." />
