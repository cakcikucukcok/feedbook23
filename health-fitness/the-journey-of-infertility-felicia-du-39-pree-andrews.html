  <title>“The Journey of Infertility” - Felicia Du&#39;Pree Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Infertility is sometimes a very lonely and tender process. Often you feel as though no one knows the pain of what you are going through in the process. During my time of research and evaluation of the matter it was difficult to find many people speaking out about the pain of day to day infertility. I read many books but I needed personal testimonies and to know what a person experiences as they go through infertility. 
I happen to be a very private person and when God spoke to my heart over 10 years ago to write this book initially I was  a little nervous to tell others exactly how this experience felt. Many of my friends had no idea. However, God wants me to share this book and my story with you in hopes that it can help suffering women and men that are dealing with the struggles of infertility. You are about to read about someone who has walked in the shoes of infertility. You will also find some humor in some situations that will make you laugh.  Nevertheless, this is a serious situation and I know if you read this book you will find that you are not alone in your feelings.
