  <title>Online Dating Bliss: Practical Guide to Internet Dating for Love Seekers! - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Online dating is not all fun and games and there are a lot of things that a person has to know about online dating before one gets into the intricacies of it. Online dating may seem to be the simplest thing in the world but it is not.   It should be viewed in all earnestness or things could go haywire. Every game has its rules and unless you know all the rules, you just can&#39;t become a good player and eventually a winner.   You can either use this book as a general guideline to streamline your match-hunting venture, or you can keep coming back to it to make sure of every step before you actually put your foot forward. I can promise you that if you use this book to guide you, there is no need to fear at all...you just won&#39;t stumble." />
