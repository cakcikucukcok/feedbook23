  <title>And Rainedrops Fall Down My Cheeks - Raine, Jia Sen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Award winning book placing with Readers Favorite and Pinnacle Book Achievement Awards - Raine demonstrates her spiritual growth and her acknowledgement of psychic gifts despite her initial self denial. Raine encourages the reader to open their minds to inter-dimensional learning and offers the readers self empowerment through their own spiritual development.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Her sincerity toward her reader as she describes her growing understanding of her gift through trials, tribulations, insights, and revelations shines through, as does the transcendent love that she radiates to those around her, and through her book. - Ila France Porcher author of My Sunset Rendezvous&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that those who have felt the touch of those who have left us, as well as those who either have never experienced or have never been able to explain or articulate a cherished visitation, will find both comfort and understanding from this book.   -   William Speir author of &quot;Knights of the Saltier&lt;/p&gt;" />
