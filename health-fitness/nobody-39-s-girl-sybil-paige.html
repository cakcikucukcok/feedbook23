  <title>Nobody&#39;s Girl - Sybil Paige</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nobodys Girl is a work of hope. The author writes in such a way that you resonate on a primordial level. Whether you have experienced trauma or addiction issues or know someone who has. The book speaks to all of us. And we all have experienced painful situations at some point or another. While it deals with some difficult topics the books story is written to engage and focus on the positive outcome profited from doing the hard but necessary work to get to the other side of any painful issues. After a lifetime of hiding behind multiple facades, personalities, careers, sex, money, drugs, alcohol, and false bravado. Her survivor tools fail her. She is faced with having to talk about the truth or die. 
Her ability to speak from a recovery standpoint is not only profound for a newbie in the recovery process but for a survivor of traumatic abuse it is remarkable. Without having to engage in the hard explicit detail, by detail scenarios, we are able see the application of her newfound tools at work on the PTSD, her addition and how she found and used the tools to freedom. The book takes us through the process needed for her to find freedom and self-realization in a genuine real sense, that if we talk about it, do the work we can heal and in that process regain hope. Hope is the message. There is relief. Beautifully written and spiritually uplifting." />
