  <title>Emotional Intelligence Pocketbook - Margaret Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Easy on the eye with humorous illustrations, this little book teaches us about ourselves and the huge role our emotions play. It is a great size for dipping in and out of, hitting the spot on every scenario. The book is broken down into clear sections, firstly identifying EI, then advising how to develop your own EI, complete with informative teachings on how to achieve this. Who would benefit from reading this book? A shorter list would be who wouldn&#39;t, as it is for managers, team leaders and team players alike. Many of the scenarios can even be adapted to life outside the work place as it is all about developing your personality. Without giving too much away, this little book teaches you how to turn negatives into positives and how to get the best out of ourselves and others. It can grow self-esteem and confidence in yourself and those around you.&quot; &quot;Margaret Chapman has packed a great deal of wisdom into this small package. Unusually, she tells us not only what Emotional Intelligence is but also how it can be practically developed. Read this book, put some of its ideas into practice, and that could change your life.&quot; Michael Chaskalson, CEO, Mindfulness Works Ltd. &quot;Insightful - outlines how to develop the skills that will ensure you can influence outcomes and get more of what you want, while bringing others with you.&quot; Gladeana McMahon, Chair, Association for Coaching UK." />
