  <title>Escaping the Boy: My Life with a Sociopath - Paula Carrasquillo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This is the story of a seemingly innocent little boy who grows into a ferocious, conscienceless, ugly monster that destroys and devours everything good and pure that crosses his path. From tender childhood friendships to sweet innocent romances, nothing is immune to the monsters dark spell and insidious nature.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is also a story of survival and hope: survival of intimate partner abuse and hope that one day there will be an end to domestic violence and to the suffering of the silent victims.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Twice, I have been a victim (and survivor) of domestic violence/intimate partner abuse in my lifetime.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the age of 18, I was physically abused by my boyfriend who was also 18. He beat me repeatedly and threatened my life in many ways. I was able to escape the relationship but never spoke about it and was determined NEVER to put myself in that type of danger in the future.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Twenty years later, at the age of 38, I found myself in another abusive relationship, but I didnt recognize it as abusive because he never assaulted me physically (at first); the abuse was verbal and emotional. The control was overwhelming, and the insidiousness of his abuse slowly took over me and nearly destroyed my spirit and faith in goodness.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Today, 18 months after escaping my second abusive relationship, I have vowed to speak. I cannot remain silent.
