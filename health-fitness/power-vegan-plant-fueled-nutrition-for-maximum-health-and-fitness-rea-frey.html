  <title>Power Vegan: Plant-Fueled Nutrition for Maximum Health and Fitness - Rea  Frey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Power Vegan&lt;/I&gt; is a guide to finding the foods that will truly power our daily lives and explains the reasoning behind how eating a more plant-based diet will achieve this aim. Whether readers want to eat better, get fit, or train like an athlete, &lt;I&gt;Power Vegan&lt;/I&gt; contains the personalized, balanced approach to a healthier lifestyle. The idea behind power eating is not a fad diet. It&#39;s about incorporating foods into your life that you like, make you feel good, are easy to prepare, and are not too expensive. The book is filled not only with tips, but easy 30-minutes-or-less recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, and snacks. Whether the goal is gaining energy, building muscle, or simply feeling and functioning better, &lt;I&gt;Power Vegan&lt;/I&gt; will provide the tools to get healthy and avoid all-too-common pitfalls. Power eating is not about being tied to the gym or the kitchen, but rather about fitting in the health concepts everyone needs while ditching the rest of the diet and exercise &quot;noise&quot; that people are bombarded with every day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
