  <title>Barbara Ann - Barbara Ann Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever noticed how the word ambulance is written backwards on the front of the emergency vehicle? The reason is so that when you sit in your car and look behind you in your mirror you can read it and know that help and hope is on the way for some one who is hurting or in need of help.   
In life sometimes as we sit and look behind us we can see many things unfold that have happened.  As Barbara Ann sat and thought about the events that have happened in her life she realized how many things she experienced, some tragic, some sad, many happy, and some can only be explained by just two words, faith and miracles. 
The same way that an ambulance is a sign of help on the way, the story in this book is bringing help and hope for many people. Not just hurting people, or people with no hope, but people who have questions about where and how to find peace, or people who just need encouragement. 
Barbara Ann has shared her life story in hundreds of churches and meetings, across this country. The people laugh and they cry through out the story, but they always get encouraged, and come away with a new and uplifted view of life. It is a story about her life, and events in it, her love expressed in the family, and her faith tested to the limits. The one Goal she has with this book is to let people know that God is good, all the time." />
