  <title>Inside the Blindside: the Journey - Cherise P. Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cherise P. Pierce, a mother,
author, online columnist,
writer, mentor and speaker,
who focuses on exposing
hidden truths and the
complexity of personal and
professional relationships.
Studies are in Journalism, which fueled her passion
for writing and the founder of her Single Moms Lets
Talk online column www.singlemomsletstalk.com. An
aspiration of hers is to have her own clothing line that
sends a positive message of inner strength. Make a
statement without saying a word, is her mission, while
communicating a message to motivate, empower and
enlighten young and mature women all over.
The contents of this book is what she wished was
around before she was pregnant at eighteen, to give
her straight talk and reveal costly consequences. At
that age, she said she needed it to teach her what others
tip-toed around, other than show her how not to put
her standards down. Applying her spiritual sense of
knowledge is what keeps her grounded and being street
savvy is what keeps her one step ahead of the game." />
