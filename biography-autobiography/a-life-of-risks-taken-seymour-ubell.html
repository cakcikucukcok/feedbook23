  <title>A Life of Risks Taken - Seymour Ubell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seymour Ubell is not a household name?but he should be. He has gone about his life taking risks in business that border on the dare-devil, not unlike taking a leap into space on a hang glider, all the while knowing the skill and strength you bring to the flight is all you have to arrive safely. He learned in the school of hard knocks, worked with tyrants and mentors who taught him equally well. His heart always pursued the sale, and his personality fit that endless quest perfectly. His friends and family benefit from his love and generosity, although his personal life has had its share of challenges and heartache. He explains his view of life through a prism of one well lived. He has made mistakes, as humans always do. He has enjoyed his triumphs and learned from his failures. Seymour Ubell is a world traveler, a sportsman, a true professional entrepreneur. He enjoys the validation of enormous international business success to sustain his passion for the hard work that success demands. He brings this passion to entrepreneurs in the making as a university lecturer on business and entrepreneurial concepts. A LIFE OF RISKS TAKEN is his memoir, although it does not tell how everything turns out. He is still at the helm of his businesses living his life with gusto. Every young entrepreneur will learn what it takes to build a business from the ground up through the valuable lessons and perspectives Seymour Ubell shares about how life, work and love intertwine to help the entrepreneurial heart sustain the required forward motion of success. Read, laugh, learn." />
