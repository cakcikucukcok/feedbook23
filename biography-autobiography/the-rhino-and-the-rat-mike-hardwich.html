  <title>The Rhino and the Rat - Mike Hardwich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following on from the success of his first book, The Lion and the Lamb - Memoirs of a Vet, this second collection of stories, The Rhino and the Rat - Further Memoirs of a Vet, from Mike Hardwich is every bit as captivating as the first. As a country vet his clients range from cattle farmers to owners of domestic pets, from game ranchers to circus owners. The demands on a vet are constant and often arrive at very inconvenient times. Called upon day and night, Mike brings to each case his skills, ingenuity and years of experience, and although he never loses sight of his aim of preserving and improving the lives of the animals he is called upon to treat, sometimes he is sorely challenged by their owners. Whether he is describing the difficult birth of a two-headed calf, discovering sheep scab on the Isle of Man, caring for Dorothy the elephant in her declining years, or helping Reggie the rat&#39;s grieving owner accept his impending demise, Mike&#39;s compassion and pragmatic humour never seem to flag. These enjoyable tales of the trials, tribulations and triumphs of a veterinarian who always sleeps with one ear cocked, will leave you wanting more." />
