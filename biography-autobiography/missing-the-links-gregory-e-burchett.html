  <title>Missing the Links - Gregory E. Burchett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine coming home, and finding your 17-month old son&#39;s body in your bed.  Imagine discovering that your wife, or what was once your wife, had taken the life of your son.
How would you react?
What would you do?
&quot;Missing The Links&quot; is a book written by Greg Burchett which vividly describes the tragic event that altered his life forever.
Greg takes the reader on an intimate journey, describing what ultimately led up to this tragedy, how he dealt with the loss of his son, and how he began his recovery.
Gluing together the shattered pieces of a life destroyed is often the most difficult thing anyone can experience in their lives.
This book offers rare insight into how Greg attempted to be successful in dealing with this tragedy.  He starkly discusses his failures, as well.  It is vividly written, from his heart, and articulately edited through his mind.
This book is different.  It is written from a man&#39;s perspective.  It is written from a husband&#39;s perspective.
When discussing the murder of a child, very little is available from this perspective.  Much has been written clinically, or even from the woman&#39;s point-of-view.  But the insights of a loving father, a husband who felt a loss of &quot;control&quot; over his life, and on his ultimate strength rediscovered.
Finding optimism in the center of turmoil...
Admitting you need help...
Realizing that there were many &quot;warning signs&quot; or &quot;missing links&quot; which, if recognized, could have avoided such a tragedy.
These are the central themes of this book.
Themes, that anyone, anywhere, can relate to." />
