  <title>The Zanzibar Chest - Aidan Hartley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Combining literary reportage, memoir, family history, and a quest to piece together a decades-old mystery, &lt;I&gt;The Zanzibar Chest&lt;/I&gt; is a moving examination of colonialism and its consequences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In his final days, Aidan Hartley&amp;#8217;s father said to him, &amp;#147;We should have never come.&amp;#8221; Those words spoke of a colonial legacy that stretched back through four generations of one British family. From a great-great-grandfather who defended British settlements in nineteenth-century New Zealand, to his father, a colonial officer sent to Africa in the 1920s and who later returned to raise a family there&amp;#151;these were intrepid men who traveled to exotic lands to conquer, build, and bear witness. And there is Aidan, who becomes a journalist covering Africa in the 1990s, a decade marked by terror and genocide. After encountering the violence in Somalia, Uganda, and Rwanda, Aidan retreats to his family&amp;#8217;s house in Kenya where he discovers the Zanzibar chest his father left him. Intricately hand-carved, the chest contained the diaries of his father&amp;#8217;s best friend, Peter Davey, an Englishman who had died under obscure circumstances five decades before. With the papers as his guide, Hartley embarked on a journey not only to unlock the secrets of Davey&amp;#8217;s life, but his own.&lt;/div&gt;" />
