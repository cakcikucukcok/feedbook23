  <title>John James Audubon - John Burroughs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is American Naturalist John Burroughs&#39; 1902 biography of John James Audubon. John James Audubon (1785 - 1851) was an American ornithologist, painter, and naturalist. He was a prolific writer on the subject of birds, and his book &quot;The Birds of America&quot; (1827) is commonly hailed as being among the finest ornithological works ever written. John Burroughs (1837 - 1921) was an American naturalist, essayist, and active member of the U.S. conservation movement. Burroughs&#39; work was incredibly popular during his lifetime, and his legacy has lived on in the form of twelve U.S. Schools named after him, Burroughs Mountain, and the John Burroughs Association-which publicly recognizes well-written and illustrated natural history publications. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
