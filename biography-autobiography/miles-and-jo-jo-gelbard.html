  <title>Miles and Jo - Jo Gelbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People just stop being interestingknow what I mean? They go so far and then they stop. Theres no more. Somehow I&#39;m never with a woman more than seven years. Some dont go longer than a few minutes. When the music stops, Im done and need to move on.Miles Davis
It was 1968. Jo Gelbard was an eighteen-year-old art student in New York City when she gave up her aspirations to be a painter and married the man she thought was the love of her life. True to her traditional upbringing, she devoted herself to her husband and son and lived what looked like the perfect lifeeven as she began slowly disappearing as a person.
Then, on a January morning in 1984, a chance encounter with a fellow tenant in her Upper East Side high-rise took Jo completely by surprise. It was Miles Davis, arguably the greatest and most influential jazz musician in the world. Married to award-winning actress Cicely Tyson, he was a Platinum-selling trumpeter, bandleader, and film composer. For both Jo and Miles, the connection was immediate, unmistakable, and thrilling. 
Over time, their casual friendship escalated into a disruptive yet liberating affair that would build Jos self-esteem, give her dormant artistic ambitions a shot of adrenaline, and catch her absolutely off guard. But Miles, charming, inviting, and sensual, had a dark sidecruel, reckless, jealous, and frighteningly intense. And at thirty-two years oldmarried for fourteen years with a seven-year-old sonJo found herself torn between this fiercely passionate man and her frustratingly indifferent husband, living a double life, and tormented by her inability to choose between the two.
Now, for the first time, Jo shares not only her own journey of self-discovery, but provides a rare, inside portrait of Miles Davis himself, and the private demons that fueled his genius. Ultimately, MILES AND JO: LOVE STORY IN BLUE is the story of two artists, striving for individuality, alone and together." />
