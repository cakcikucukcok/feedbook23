  <title>Bipolar Shoes - Dave O&#39;Riordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the second book for O&#39;Riordan on bipolar disorder. He incorporates his life into telling the story of an ordinary workingmans battle with bipolar disorder. His imagination is nothing short of brillant and his passion is overflowing with hope.
Dave has overcome so many obstacles and still has the most optimistic outlook on life. He has a great sense of humor and even when things look bad he can always put a positive spin on it. I loved reading this book because he is so honest and genuine and all he wants in return is the ability to help others that are struggling to cope with Bipolar Disorder. When Dave writes you can actually feel the emotion as you read....it&#39;s almost like the words go through your eyes and into your heart. 
                                                                                          Karen Stempien
                                                                                          Calmar, Alberta, Canada.
Dave O&#39;Riordan writes from his heart and his compassion and empathy is evident on every page of this book. Anyone who has experienced bipolar disorder or has a family member or friend affected by it will appreciate the message of hope and courage that Dave provides in this book. I have known Dave for many years and he is a tireless advocate for bipolar patients and has several candid suggestions on how society must respond, reach out and provide help and support to those affect by this mental illness. This book makes good reading for anyone with a conscience and I highly recommend it.
