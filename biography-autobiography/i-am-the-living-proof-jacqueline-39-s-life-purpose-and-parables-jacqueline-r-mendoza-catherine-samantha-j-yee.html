  <title>I Am the Living Proof-Jacqueline&#39;s Life, Purpose and Parables - Jacqueline R. Mendoza, Catherine, Samantha J. Yee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I AM THE LIVING PROOF  Jacquelines Life, Purpose and Parables 
Portrays the method of being 97% dead awakened, proved
She will rise through obstacles in her journey to share 
How despite of her physical difficulties she struggled
Wisdom, Courage
Perseverance, Patience and Tolerance
Added with her enormous amount of determination
 Hope and Faith
Amazing how God showed His love
In finding out who really is Jesus Christ
As He chose her to spread about the truth
Of His Gospel
She wants to assist people in knowing the facts
Treated it as her job for Jesus Christ
To be a resource for the reality of God
She wants to plant a seed in your minds
Her way of communicating to people
As Christ placed her in mission
Souls in Hell of fire, furnace of fire and unquenchable fire
Thought Jesus did not do anything
He gave you a freedom to choose
People chooses the path of hell
Must choose the right decision
Once youre there, you cannot go back
Its forever
Do not just accept
Think wisely, Research, Study and comprehend
Which is the path to Jesus Christ that leads to Heaven and face the Father?" />
