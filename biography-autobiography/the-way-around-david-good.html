  <title>The Way Around - David Good</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rooted in two vastly different cultures, a young man struggles to understand himself, find his place in the world, and reconnect with his mother&amp;#8212;and her remote tribe in the deepest jungles of the Amazon rainforest&amp;#8212;in this powerful memoir that combines adventure, history, and anthropology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;My Yanomami family called me by name. Anyopo-we. What it means, I soon learned, is &amp;#8216;long way around&amp;#8217;: I&amp;#8217;d taken the long way around obstacles to be here among my people, back where I started. A twenty-year detour.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of his young life, David Good was torn between two vastly different worlds. The son of an American anthropologist and a tribeswoman from a distant part of the Amazon, it took him twenty years to embrace his identity, reunite with the mother who left him when he was six, and claim his heritage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Way Around&lt;/em&gt; is Good&amp;#8217;s amazing chronicle of self-discovery. Moving from the wilds of the Amazonian jungle to the paved confines of suburban New Jersey and back, it is the story of his parents, his American scientist-father and his mother who could not fully adapt to the Western lifestyle. Good writes sympathetically about his mother&amp;#8217;s abandonment and the deleterious effect it had on his young self; of his rebellious teenage years marked by depression and drinking, and the near-fatal car accident that transformed him and gave him purpose to find a way back to his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A compelling tale of recovery and discovery, &lt;em&gt;The Way Around&lt;/em&gt; is a poignant, fascinating exploration of what family really means, and the way that the strongest bonds endure, even across decades and worlds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
