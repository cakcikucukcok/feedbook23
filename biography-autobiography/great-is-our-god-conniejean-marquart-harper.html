  <title>Great Is Our God - ConnieJean Marquart-Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Great is Our God will take you on a journey into the lives of the Marquarts and a deeper knowledge of Gods abiding presence and power in your life.  Between the covers of this book you will meet a small town family who will make you laugh, and make you cry; they are you ... your family ... the neighbors down your street. This family will open your eyes to the reality of Gods intervention and miracles today for those who truly love God and believe His Word. For those who struggle with the Word of God and its application for our lives today, this book will assure you our God is real, His Word is true, and  ... He is the same yesterday, and today, and forever [Hebrews 13:8]. He still raises the dead, heals our diseases, gives hearing to the deaf, protects, leads and guides, His children.  And he [Jesus] said unto them, ... these signs shall follow them that believe; ... [Mark 16:15-18]  Doubt not, ... whosoever ... shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe ... he shall have whatsoever he saith. For there is no respect of persons with God [Romans 2:11]  What God has done for the Marquarts, He can and will do for any child of God who truly believes in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a book that will ... inspire you to believe God is a God of miracles, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever, and the God of miracles can be your God for miracles in your own life, then this is the book for You! Rev. David Snodderly &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will excite you, enlighten you, educate you in the Word of God, and energize your faith, to see God move in your life Rev. Mark Marquart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IN A WORLD, where there is Injustice, Brutality, and EXPLOSIONS! ... Where the media shows Sex, Violence, and GRATUITOUS GUN PLAY! .. Where the People have BAD ATTITUDES! From out of this Existance of Chaos and Bad Manners strolls a HEROIC FIGURE -A Woman, with long white braided Hair, like a whip, and long black Skirt, a Bible in her Hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;STANDING TALL, her Steely blue Eyes piercing through the INIQUITY. With a Wry Smile and a Hand as swift as a Gunslingers, she snatches a  mard quart  of hot liquid, from underneath her overcoat and says,  Would you like some coffee ? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PASTOR MOMMA ! ... Angels Love her.  PASTOR MOMMA ! ... Demons Fear her.  PASTOR MOMMA ! ... General for JESUS,  Guardian for the WORD of GOD ! !&lt;/p&gt;
