  <title>Einstein - Jürgen Neffe, Shelley Frisch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein is an icon of the twentieth century. Born in Ulm, Germany, in 1879, he is most famous for his theory of relativity. He also made enormous contributions to quantum mechanics and cosmology, and for his work he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921. A self-pronounced pacifist, humanist, and, late in his life, democratic socialist, Einstein was also deeply concerned with the social impact of his discoveries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of Einstein&#39;s life is shrouded in legend. From popular images and advertisements to various works of theater and fiction, he has come to signify so many things. In &lt;i&gt;Einstein: A Biography&lt;/i&gt;, Jürgen Neffe presents a clear and probing portrait of the man behind the myth. Unearthing new documents, including a series of previously unknown letters from Einstein to his sons, which shed new light on his role as a father, Neffe paints a rich portrait of the tumultuous years in which Einstein lived and worked. And with a background in the sciences, he describes and contextualizes Einstein&#39;s enormous contributions to our scientific legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Einstein&lt;/i&gt;, a breakout bestseller in Germany, is sure to be a classic biography of the man and proverbial genius who has been called &quot;the brain of the [twentieth] century.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
