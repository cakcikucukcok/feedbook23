  <title>John and Caroline - James Spada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;They were America&#39;s children, symbolic of hope and youth, then of tragedy, and finally of the enduring power of the Kennedy legacy.  In the 255 vibrant photographs in this book - mostly never before published - we watch John and Caroline grow up in the adoring, and sometimes harsh, glare of public attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were the youngest children to live in the White House in over a century - Caroline just three and John Jr. a newborn when their father took the oath of office.  Symbolizing the youthful vigor of the new administration, they won the hearts of the American people as they romped around - and under - their father&#39;s desk in the Oval Office.  And when, three years later, Caroline kissed JKF&#39;s coffin and John Jr. saluted the passing bier, they were forever etched into the nations&#39; collective heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see their awkward adolescence, their sorrows at senseless losses in the family, their first forays into romance, their efforts to establish themselves as responsible adults, their happy marriages and Caroline&#39;s motherhood.  And we watch in admiration as Caroline recovers from the untimely death of her beloved brother to assume the mantle of the Camelot legend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a book that will tug at the heart-strings of all who remember fondly these two remarkable American offspring.&lt;/p&gt;" />
