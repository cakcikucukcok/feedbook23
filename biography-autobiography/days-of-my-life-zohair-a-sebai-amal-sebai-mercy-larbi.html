  <title>Days of My Life - Zohair A. Sebai, Amal Sebai, Mercy Larbi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My aim is to present some glimpses into my life. What should I say? And should I tell everything that there is to be told? 
That is impossible, because we all have areas of our lives that we would rather keep to ourselves and not share with anyone else. A human being is a mystery. Therefore, I cannot claim that my writing will be characterized by objectivity. How objective can one be when talking about oneself? 
I can easily state that the reason for writing my story is to shed some light on my experiences in life: the sweet with the bitter may serve as valuable lessons for the youth. What is more difficult is to admit that writing my story is actually a personal journey to self-discovery. This story can be split into different stages: growing up in Makkah, my education and travels in Egypt, Germany, and America, and finally my struggle up the career ladder. 
My deep appreciation goes to Mrs. Amal Sebai and Mrs. Mercy Larbi for translating the book into English." />
