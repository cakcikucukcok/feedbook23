  <title>Watch Me Die - Dr. Bill Kimberlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Watch Me Die is a firsthand account of Ohio&amp;#39;s death row and the state&amp;rsquo;s execution process unlike any other. Dr. Kimberlin, a trained clinical psychologist and professor of psychology, goes beyond the prison walls and into the world of death row inmates. No bars, no shackles, and no chains. Kimberlin spends time one-on-one with some of Ohio&amp;#39;s worst killers to learn about their life on death row. Then he watches them die. &amp;nbsp;You will see how these inmates think as Kimberlin not only spends time interviewing them but also eats meals with them and, in some cases, is the last person to speak to them before they are executed. &amp;nbsp; You will also be walked through the full execution process, starting from when the inmate is placed on suicide watch and going until they are pronounced dead on the execution table. &amp;nbsp; You will see the flaws in the system and be able to judge for yourself if the death penalty, as it is utilized today, is really worth pursuing. &amp;nbsp; This book promises to take you into the depths of death row and into the minds of killers like no one else has ever been able to do before. You will see their artwork, their writings, and their mindset as they prepare for their final days on this planet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
