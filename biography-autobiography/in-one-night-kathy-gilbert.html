  <title>In One Night - Kathy Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is my story about a night that would change my life.
It all started on May 27th, 1961.My mama (Trish) received a call from her sister-in-law, Jan that day. Jan wanted to know if she could go with Leah to the dog races in Jacksonville. She was going to go but Lisa, the baby got sick and she can&#39;t go. Trish told Jan that she would have to talk to Chad, her husband first. Chad got off work at 3pm.When he got home Trish asked him about going with Leah to the dog races. Chad told her it would be alright and that he would take care of the children. Trish is a loving, dedicated mother. Chad figured that she could use a little time to unwind and relax. So, she called Jan to let her know that she would go with Leah the next night which was, May the 28th.She was a little excited and nervous because she had not been away from the children in a long time. She knew that Chad would take real good care of them. Trish set the table and went to get ready. Kathy asked her mama if she could go, but her mama told her that she would have to be daddy&#39;s little helper just for tonight. Chad put June in the high chair, Bill at the table and he held Louise, while Trish finished getting ready. Leah pulled up about five, to pick Trish up. Kathy started crying and begging her mama to please let her go. Chad took Kathy by the hand and told her that he needed her to stay to help him with her baby sister. Kathy still wanted to go. She wanted to be with her mama. She watched as they pulled out of the drive way. Trish promised Kathy that she would see her in the morning. Little did any of them know that that would be the last time any of them would see her again..." />
