  <title>Leaving Fundamentalism - G. Elijah Dann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; In a time when religious conservatives have placed their faith and values at the forefront of the so-called “culture wars,” this book is extremely relevant. The stories in &lt;i&gt;Leaving Fundamentalism&lt;/i&gt; provide a personal and intimate look behind sermons, religious services, and church life, and promote an understanding of those who have been deeply involved in the conservative Christian church. These autobiographies come from within the congregations and homes of religious fundamentalists, where their highly idealized faith, in all its complexities and problems, meets the reality of everyday life. Told from the perspective of distance gained by leaving fundamentalism, each story gives the reader a snapshot of what it is like to go through the experiences, thoughts, feelings, passions, and pains that, for many of the writers, are still raw. Explaining how their lives might continue after fundamentalism, these writers offer a spiritual lifeline for others who may be questioning their faith. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Foreword by Thomas Moore &lt;/p&gt;" />
