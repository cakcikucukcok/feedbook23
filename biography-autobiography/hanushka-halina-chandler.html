  <title>Hanushka - Halina Chandler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hanushka:&lt;/b&gt; Quest for Freedom&lt;/i&gt; is a true story that takes place during the time of Nazi and the Communist regimes in Poland. (Hanushka is a diminutive form of my formal name Halina.) The struggle for survival from an early age made me strong, determined, and even defiant when necessary. When I was a foreign language teacher at Reno high school, my students were always fascinated by my stories about the war. From these experiences, I know that young readers will enjoy the story and will gain insights into dignity, pride, respect, morality, desire for education, courage, loyalty and, above all, responsibility.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nv * Local Review An intriguing tale of war, occupation, family ties, love and determination. It is a true story based on Halina Chanklers life behind the Iron Curtain, and her escape from it. The story moves from her childood in Poland, to adulthood in Germany and France, and describes her will and strength to survive, love and succeed at life. It is also a timely statement regarding tolerance, love of mankind forgiveness and finding peace in everyday encounters with all peoples.

*The following are 2 of 4 poems written by a highschool girl after reading &quot;Hanushka&quot;. The Nightmare When you wake in lthe night. and everythings strange.. And you dont know the reason why everythings changed.. Youve heard all the stories of why this is so.. but deep in your heart, you dont really know. Its a nightmare youre living.. a nightmare called life.. and you dont know each day if you will survive. Julianne Burgarello Galena High School / Reno Nv Leaving One Life and Starting Another What could be worse than what it is now? What could this change make better? Im leaving behind all that i know My mother, my child, my brother. This world that i know is dark and tense.. each morning i wake to fear.. I cannot plan what must be done.. God, help me go on from here. Julianne Burgarello Galena High School / Reno," />
