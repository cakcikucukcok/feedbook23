  <title>From Pythagoras to Salt Lake City - John Andreadakis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here is an expanded perspective of Greek History and aspects of both old and Modern Greek history that you would not find elsewhere. Greek and Hebrew languages and writing have nothing in common, yet their alphabets are identical. What does this mean? Where was the Greek language developed? Was it developed in Athens? No, not really. Pythagoras left his country to learn. He learned mathematics to teach us even in our days. But he also found the existence of a true and caring God and wanted his people to know it also. As Pythagoras of old in a similar fashion, the author of this book left Greece and immigrated to the United States to learn electronics. He used to think that religion was the knowledge of stories about good men God loved, but only in the old days, not today. Two young missionaries knocked on his door and taught him that a true religion is a set of principles we needed to strive to learn and follow. How can a person know if a church is true? The author&#39;s life combined with the discovery of such principles gave him a happier way of life and his children are blessed because of it also. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith, humility, honesty, integrity, and many other principles are what our world is in need of today and are well documented in this book.  These principles make everyone a better person, a happier person in a better society. Is Salt Lake City a good milestone? It has been for this author and for many other people from all walks of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
