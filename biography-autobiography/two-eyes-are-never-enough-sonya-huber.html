  <title>Two Eyes Are Never Enough - Sonya Huber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sonya Huber’s memoir takes us behind the scenes in one of the most invisible professions in the United States: direct care. Huber went into the field of direct care work in mental health hoping to make a difference in the lives of teenagers, and planning for a career in social work. What she encountered was startling and revealing—dangerous and unhealthy conditions, poverty wages, and work that took a heavy emotional toll. Melding reporting with personal experiences, she searches for possible solutions for workers and clients alike, bringing to light a profession that serves our most vulnerable population with some of the most stressed-out workers. Humane and beautifully written, this memoir will make everyone stop and think about how we care for each other in this culture." />
