  <title>My Journey from Plainville to Pensacola - Richard Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dick has lived a full life. He wanted to record some of his memories for his current and future family to allow them to understand the different lives we all lived back in 1937 to 2017. 
Growing up in small towns in Connecticut and then traveling through a good portion of this World has given him a different perspective than most of those who never ventured far from their homesteads. 
Serving over 22 years in the U.S. Navy was a blessing in disguise. Though always under paid and poor. During the Vietnam Conflict being spit at, cussed, harassed and called names while in uniform by his fellow U.S. Citizens that he was suppose to be protecting tore him up! Now he is often thanked for his service and feels good to be appreciated. It makes him feel proud." />
