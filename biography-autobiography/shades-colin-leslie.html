  <title>Shades - Colin Leslie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Long before the deaths of Wales manager Gary Speed and Germany goalkeeper Robert Enke shocked football, the Scottish game was forced to deal with a numbing death of its own over Christmas 1985. International full-back Erich Schaedler, aged 36, was found dead in a Borders beauty spot, with a shotgun by his side and no suicide note or motive for taking his own life. A straightforward suicide? So it seemed at the time, but family and friends are not so sure, and to this day mystery surrounds his tragic death. Schaedler&#39;s loss was felt deeply in the game. He was one of the fittest, hardest men in Scottish football, and appeared indestructible. Fearless and ferocious as a player but a gentleman and genial character off the pitch, Schaedler stood out from the crowd with his lung-bursting runs, long throw-ins and dedicated fitness. Enjoying a career encompassing clubs such as Stirling Albion, Hibernian&#39;s Turnbull&#39;s Tornadoes team of the 1970s, Dundee, Dumbarton and, of course, the Scotland international team of 1974 World Cup fame, he proved how far hard work and commitment can take a professional sportsman. For the first time, Shades presents an intimate portrait of an incredible man, pieced together by his family, friends, managers, trainers and teammates, who share their memories of a man lost in his prime and a person who enriched the lives of all he knew, both on and off the pitch." />
