  <title>Wild by Nature - Sarah Marquis, Stephanie Hellert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One woman &lt;br&gt; 10,000 miles on foot&lt;br&gt; 6 countries&lt;br&gt; 8 pairs of hiking boots&lt;br&gt; 3,000 cups of tea&lt;br&gt; 1,000 days and nights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;The only way to survive three years of walking was to embrace the moment of now.&quot;--from &lt;i&gt;Wild by Nature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not since Cheryl Strayed gifted us with her adventure on the Pacific Crest Trail in her memoir, &lt;i&gt;Wild,&lt;/i&gt; has there been such a powerful epic adventure by a woman alone. In &lt;i&gt;Wild by Nature,&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;National Geographic&lt;/i&gt; Explorer Sarah Marquis takes you on the trail of her ten-thousand-mile solo hike across the remote Gobi desert from Siberia to Thailand, at which point she was transported by boat to complete the hike at her favorite tree in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Against nearly insurmountable odds and relying on hunting and her own wits, Sarah Marquis survived the Mafia, drug dealers, thieves on horseback who harassed her tent every night for weeks, temperatures from subzero to scorching, life-threatening wildlife, a dengue fever delirium in the Laos jungle, tropic ringworm in northern Thailand, dehydration, and a life-threatening abscess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is an incredible story of adventure, human ingenuity, persistence, and resilience that shows firsthand what it is to adventure as a woman in the most dangerous of circumstance, what it is to be truly alone in the wild, and why someone would challenge themselves with an expedition others would call crazy. For Marquis, her story is about freedom, being alive and wild by nature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
