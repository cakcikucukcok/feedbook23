  <title>Welcome to the ‘Nam - Rod Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I was young, like so many other young men of my generation, I gave our country what we thought was our obligation to our country.  Like the generation of our fathers and the generation that came after us.
I never minded a persons belief in being against the war in Vietnam.  But they forgot that the ones that served were good people too.  They found us in contempt.  But they were wrong.  We did what this generation is doing in Iraq and Afghanistan.  There is no difference.
Things have changed over the years and people now thank us for our service as they do the new generation.  That is nice, and should be said.
The misnomer that we lost the war is not accurate.  We won every major battle in Vietnam we fought.  Often times out-numbered.  The Communists only fought major battles when they had the advantage.  The Tet offensive of 1968 hurt them severely, completely wiping out the V.C. Army and making the N.V.A. Army rebuild.
If North Vietnam would have honored the peace treaty, it would have been like the Korean War with the south and the north.
America did not though support South Vietnam after our troops moved out.  Congress did not appropriate funds to the South Vietnamese government.  But I think our country could no longer fund in money and lives.  It always would come down to that.
Stats of Marines in Vietnam:   26% casualty rate.  Highest of any combat group in South Vietnam." />
