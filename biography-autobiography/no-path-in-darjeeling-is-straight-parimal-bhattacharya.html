  <title>No Path in Darjeeling Is Straight - Parimal Bhattacharya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For a few years in the early 1990s&amp;mdash;at a time when the embers of a violent agitation for Gorkhaland were slowly dying down&amp;mdash;Parimal Bhattacharya taught at the Government College in Darjeeling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;No Path in Darjeeling Is Straight&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is a memory of his time in the iconic town, and one of the finest works of Indian non-fiction in recent years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parimal evocatively describes his arrival, through drizzle and impenetrable fog, at a place that was at odds with the grand picture of it he had painted for himself. And his first night there was spent sleepless in a ramshackle hotel above a butcher&amp;rsquo;s shop. Yet, as he tramped its roads and winding footpaths, Darjeeling grew on him. He sought out its history: a land of incomparable beauty originally inhabited by the Lepchas and other tribes; the British who took it for themselves in the mid-1800s so they could remember home; the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway&amp;mdash;once a vital artery, now a quaint toy train&amp;mdash;built in 1881; and the vast tea gardens with which the British replaced verdant forests to produce the fabled Orange Pekoe.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the enmeshed lives of his neighbours&amp;mdash;of various castes, tribes, religions and cultures&amp;mdash;lived at the measured pace of a small town, Parimal discovered a richly cosmopolitan society which endured even under threat from cynical politics and haphazard urbanization. He also found new friends: Benson, a colleague whose death from AIDS showed him the dark underbelly of the hill station; Pratap and Newton, whose homes and lives reflected the irreconcilable pulls of tradition and upward mobility; and Julia and Hemant, with whom he trekked the forests of the Singalila mountains in search of a vanished Lepcha village and a salamander long thought extinct.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With empathy, and in shimmering prose,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;No Path in Darjeeling Is Straight&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;effortlessly merges travel, history, literature, memory, politics and the pleasures of ennui into an unforgettable portrait of a place and its people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
