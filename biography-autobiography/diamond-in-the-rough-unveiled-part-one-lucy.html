  <title>Diamond in the Rough Unveiled Part One - Lucy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Left alone to raise four children following a bitter divorce, Balderes Alvarezs life careened on a path of self-destruction.  
Today, she is a wife, the mother, and stepmother of six adult children and eight grandchildren. She holds a masters degree in theology and is a preacher and teacher at her church.  She also speaks at churches and other venues, sharing with others both the tragic and wonderful details of her lifes journey.
Remove the names and dates, and her story could be that of any woman who, when faced with rejection, abandonment, and loneliness, is left with daunting choices to make. Balderess choices led her to a dark life of addiction and neglect where she lost sight of the light of God piercing through. But thanks be to God, he did break through and brought about forgiveness, miraculous healing, and complete deliverance. Balderess biographical sketch offers women truths about the power of God to break through and unveil the diamond that each life can be. Whatever the circumstance, however badly battered, no life is beyond the transforming power of our Divine Diamond Cutter. Every lost and suffering soul is a diamond in the rough. The question for the reader: are you ready to be unveiled?" />
