  <title>I Am 37 and Still a Virgin - Angela Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;I am 37 and Still a Virgin!- Funny and crazy life story of a 37 year old virgin. Many will want to know howshe did it, well this book tells all, from the time she tried to have sex with some of the little boy&#39;s in the neighborhood, to the near misses inher teenage years, up to now. This book will encourage you to not settle and free you to grow. Hill discusses, being emotionally stable, and STD free; not rushing your life away, there is time to do all you desire, putting things in the right order, setting goals, staying focused, being sure of what you like in every arena, and most importantly knowing your purpose. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Raquel McCutcheon - a Sister in Christ writes: I&#39;m on chapter six and I&#39;m having a ball with this book. It&#39;s witty, funny and addresses serious issues. It makes you want to read more, it catches your attention, but I want to eat it, not devour it because I want it to digest and I want the vitamins that come from it to be noursihing to my soul. I love it! and I love you for writing it and it has come at just the right moment in my life. This book is healing for the soul and I pray that it will reach the hands of millions no billions of readers. &lt;/P&gt;" />
