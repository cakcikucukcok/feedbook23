  <title>A Return to Chelm - Arlene Blaier Burrows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the outbreak of World War II, almost half of Chelms 36,000 residents were Jewish, but only a few hundred survived the warvirtually wiping out a community that had lived for 700 years in southeastern Poland.&lt;p&gt; 
Eight of Arlene Blaier Burrows relatives somehow survived. Seventy-two members of her family, however, were killed in the Holocaust.&lt;p&gt; 
In &lt;em&gt;A Return to Chelm&lt;/em&gt;, she goes on a deeply personal journey to learn more about her Blayer and Groman relatives who lived and died. In the process, she forges a connection with all the Jews of Chelm.&lt;p&gt; 
She traces genealogy, explores archives in Warsaw and elsewhere, and sees the death camps where so many of Polands Jews were savagely murdered. She uncovers a treasure trove of information about a lost community whose descendants continue to thrive decades after their intended annihilation.&lt;p&gt; 
While the authors elders told stories about Chelm as she was growing up, they never dwelled on its dark past. With the city seemingly lost to history, she finds theres a lot worth remembering despite the citys history of persecution, repression, and poverty.&lt;p&gt;" />
