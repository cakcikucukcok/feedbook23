  <title>The Second-Greatest Baseball Game Ever Played - Drew Bridges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    The Brooklyn Dodgers defeated the New York Yankees in the seventh game of the 1955 World Series in the greatest baseball game ever played. The
    second-greatest baseball game ever played took place Saturday, June 29, 1957. No Yankees, Giants, Dodgers, Cardinals, or Red Sox were there. The game
    played out in author Drew Bridgess hometown of Hildebran in western North Carolina. Two teams of boys, ten to fifteen years old, faced off on the high
    school baseball diamond, no uniforms and no organized league. Bridges played second base, his brother played third, and their dad coached the team.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In this memoir, Bridges tells the story of that afternoon of baseball and how it came to be through his recollections and his fathers wartime letters to
    his mother who was pregnant with their first child. It shares the words of an ordinary American serviceman who is dreaming about a life beyond war.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;Field of Dreams&lt;/em&gt;
    meets &lt;em&gt;A League of Their Own&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;The Sandlot&lt;/em&gt; in this story of a soldiers return home from World War II and his work with others in the
    community to build a youth league baseball program. The Second-Greatest Baseball Game Ever Played shares the game of baseball through the eyes of a
    ten-year-old and shows how this game captured the heart and soul of a community and became so vital to all.
