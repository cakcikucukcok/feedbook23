  <title>Daring Pioneers Tame the Frontier - Bettye B. Burkhalter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="History, Romance, &amp; Destiny...
            Daring Pioneers Tame the Frontier is an exquisite saga of Dr. Jean (John) Baptiste Elzar Burels lifelong desire to cross the Atlantic Ocean to the beckoning new America.  With his naval surgeon license in one hand and his medical chest in the other, he followed Marquis de Lafayette to Colonial America during the Revolutionary War.  During the war he fell passionately in love and married a beautiful Acadian French woman in Philadelphia.  After the war they made plans to return to his home at Ollioules, France.
            Homeward bound, the bourgeois doctor boarded the ship in Philadelphia with his new bride and their few belongings.  There on deck he was unexpectedly forced to choose between his beloved homeland and family in France and his wife with child.  Disembarking the ship with grave disappointment, John knowingly forfeited his inheritance as sole heir.  Struggling to survive in Philadelphia, oftentimes John sat quietly admiring the beautiful woman who owned his heart as he secretly yearned for his prominent family and lifestyle on the Mediterranean Coast of France.
            Standing on the threshold of the newly independent America, the young doctor decided to take his wife and infant son and pioneer down the Great Wagon Road into the raw frontier of South Carolina.  Believing he would build a new and prosperous life, he settled at Goshen Hill between the Tyger and Enoree Rivers within the lawless backcountry of South Carolina.  Fighting the dangers and hardships of the frontier, and the recurring restlessness to return to France, John and his family carved out a simple life.  Although disappointed at times, within the walls of his log home the enduring love and warmth of his wife and six children transcended adversity and hardships of the outside world.  The heartwarming story is filled with humanity as John faced his inevitable destiny.  The first novel in the trilogy closes with Dr. Burels widow standing helplessly in her front yard watching the wagon train take her spirited children and grandchildren west in search of richer land and prosperity.  It was dj vu!" />
