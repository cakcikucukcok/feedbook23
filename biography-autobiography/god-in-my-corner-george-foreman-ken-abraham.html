  <title>God In My Corner - George Foreman, Ken Abraham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Everyone needs a second chance, even if your name is George Foreman.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;My second chance arrived unexpectedly in a Puerto Rican dressing room after a heavyweight boxing match. What happened to me in that room is so incredibly bizarre, it&#39;s unlikely you&#39;ve ever before read anything like it. Simply stated, I died and went to the other side. The experience impacted me so profoundly that three decades later I can&#39;t go a single day without thinking about it.&quot;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;A childhood in grinding poverty. Two heavyweight boxing championships – twenty years apart. A life-changing encounter with God. A new life devoted to ministy. An inspiring comeback and then astounding success as an entrepreneur and trusted product pitchman.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;For the first time, George Foreman tells the whole story of his remarkable life. With the frankness, warmth, and humor you expect from Foreman, he shares the faith journey that has shaped his life, offering many life lessons along the way.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;What are the secrets to George Foreman&#39;s inspiring success?&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Why is he always smiling?&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Why did he name all five of his sons George?&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;There is no one quiet like George Foreman. &lt;I&gt;God in My Corner&lt;/I&gt; explains why. More importantly, it will open your eyes to the reality that God is there in your corner, just as He&#39;s been there for George all these years.&lt;/P&gt;" />
