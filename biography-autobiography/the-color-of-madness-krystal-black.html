  <title>The Color of Madness - Krystal Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Color of Madness is the true story of my eldest sister, Ciska, second of nine offspring. Some may recognize themselves or a loved one or an acquaintance in this individual, who watches the horizon of her hopes recede as she grows older and becomes more aware of her world. After winning a much-coveted scholarship at the age of eleven, Ciskas future promises to be as bright as the firework hurled over the fence into the backyard by neighbors eager to congratulate her and the family. However, like a shooting star, she very briefly lights up the world around her with her brilliance before disintegrating into oblivion. Indeed, her inability to adapt to absurd racial biases will plunge her loved ones into daily havoc and challenge her sanity. Consequently, Ciska repudiates a world that rejects her and seeks refuge among the insane in an attempt to preserve her sanity." />
