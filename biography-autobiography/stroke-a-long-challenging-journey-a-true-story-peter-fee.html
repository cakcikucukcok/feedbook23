  <title>Stroke: a Long, Challenging Journey-A True Story - Peter Fee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the true story of Canadian stroke survivor Peter Fee, a mature, professional businessman whose life was drastically impacted when he suffered a stroke in his 50th year.
Peter has since been undergoing the process of rehabilitation at a few Toronto area hospitals, including programs of traditional physiotherapy. Having been discharged from outpatient rehab programs, Peter had reached a plateau in his recovery. He then began and continues his quest for alternate and further possibilities of rehab and recovery.
After being home for nearly two years since his initial admission to hospital, Peter began researching numerous other avenues, techniques and equipment for self-therapy and recovery which include acupuncture, TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), Taoist Tai Chi and other miscellaneous traditional aids. He continues with these options to this day.
This is the story of his life including his youth, maturing and growth, professional career and near-death, as well as his physical recovery progress and experiences to date.
Peters story is not complete as of the printing of this book because he is continuing his recovery efforts. For this reason, Peter has already started writing his second book.
He continues to make daily progress. He is determined." />
