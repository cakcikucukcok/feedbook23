  <title>A Random Act - Cindi Broaddus, Kimberly Lohman Suiters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cindi Broaddus didn&amp;#39;t realize that her life was about to be forever altered as she sat in the passenger seat of a car on a lonely highway, speeding toward the airport in the early morning hours of June 5, 2001. A single mother of three and a delighted new grandmother, she was thinking only of her well-earned vacation when a gallon jar of sulfuric acid, tossed from an overpass by an unknown assailant, came crashing through the windshield. In a heartbeat, Cindi was showered with glass and flesh-eating liquid, leaving her screaming in agony and burned almost beyond recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Random Act&lt;/em&gt; is the riveting firsthand account of a brutal and senseless attack and its aftermath. Much more than one remarkable woman&amp;#39;s chronicle of an unthinkable tragedy and amazing recovery, Cindi&amp;#39;s story is one of hope and transcendence, born of a conscious and dedicated determination to turn a nightmarish experience into something positive and uplifting. Her unforgettable journey back to life and a gloriously renewed sense of purpose offers illuminating truths about love, healing, and the astounding power of choice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
