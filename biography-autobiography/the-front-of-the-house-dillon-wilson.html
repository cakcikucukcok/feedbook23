  <title>The Front of the House - Dillon Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was first inspired to write this book after reading some of Anthony Bourdains books, particularly Kitchen Confidential. I decided that I could write a story about the underbelly of the world of fine dining from my own perspective as a dining room manager, sommelier, and service professional. It is an autobiographic account of my own experiences, starting with when I was a teenager in high school and then detailing my first encounters in the workplace. Through trial and error, I find my true calling as a restaurateur. 
It is an odyssey, which describes in my own words the internal and external factors that shaped my career in the food and beverage industry. It covers four decades. During that time, there are subplots involving my friends and acquaintances, which revolve around the main theme of this book. Many social, political, and technological changes occurred, which had a direct and indirect impact on the course of this story and its ultimate conclusion. 
This book appeals to its readers on four different levels. It is a historical portrayal of how fashion, art, and music changed through the sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties, and into the next century. It also describes some of our nations most memorable events and tragedies as they relate to this book. 
It identifies with anyone who has ever held a job in the service industry or has ever wondered what it was really like. It has its share of romance and work politics, just like most jobs do. 
It is an informative guide for anyone interested in gastronomy and the world of eclectic beverages, in addition to exploring the wonders of the wine country from the perspective of a sommelier and service professional. 
Lastly, it has a moral element. It is a warning to all of the potential dangers and pitfalls of a demanding, high-pressure lifestyle surrounded by temptation, risk, and vulnerability. It is not for people with thin skins or inherent weaknesses. 
I have tried my best to combine all the things, which makes a book truly engaging as well as entertaining. There is humor, irony, fate, and hopefully, some valuable information for everyone to enjoy. Most of all, its a good story!" />
