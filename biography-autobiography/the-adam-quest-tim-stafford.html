  <title>The Adam Quest - Tim  Stafford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Science and faith should be allies, not opponents, in the search for truth.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to understanding the very beginnings of life, it is no easy task to reconcile the history taught in the Bible with the discoveries of the scientific community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Tim Stafford watched the tension between the beliefs of Darwin and the teaching of Genesis shake the faith of his family, ruin friendships, and leave Christians in the field of science feeling as though the doors of the church were closed to their profession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He believes this civil war can stop. The scientific record and the truth of the Bible aren&amp;rsquo;t mutually exclusive. &lt;em&gt;The Adam Quest &lt;/em&gt;offers a compelling new look at the beginnings of life as Stafford puts questions of dinosaurs, genealogy, and the age of the earth to eleven world-class scientists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sweeping book&amp;mdash;touching everything from advances in genetics to a particle physicist striving to become Anglican priest&amp;mdash;Stafford uses the stories and journeys of these remarkable men and women to provide a new diversity of answers. Scientific progress is carefully detailed, while the struggle toward truth and toward God is humanized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deeply informative look at Christians working in science, this book is for both believers and those who harbor doubts&amp;mdash;an intersection of faith and science, and a safe place for questions. Whether you believe in a young earth, intelligent design, evolutionary creationism, or something else, &lt;em&gt;The Adam Quest&lt;/em&gt; offers a chance to strengthen your faith, deepen your knowledge, and bring science back into the church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for The Adam Quest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;To a debate that usually provokes accusations, name-calling, and polarization, Tim Stafford offers a wise, mediating overview. For some, this book may well be a faith-saver.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Philip Yancey, author of What Good Is God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever been troubled by the relationship between science, the Bible, and human origins&amp;mdash;this book is for you. Tim is thoughtful of mind and generous of spirit&amp;mdash;two qualities much needed in this discussion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;John Ortberg, Senior Pastor of Menlo Park Presbyterian Church, and author of Who Is This Man?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tim Stafford provides a glimpse into the lives of eleven scientists with a strong commitment to Christian faith who are involved in the creation/evolution controversies, representing different perspectives. He goes beyond the technical details of the debates to reveal the personal experiences that underlie each of their convictions. Everyone interested in science and faith would benefit from this insightful perspective of the human sentiment behind the wide range of positions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Randy Isaac, Executive Director, American Scientific Affiliation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The importance of Stafford&amp;rsquo;s book is that it&amp;nbsp;brings together the top advocates of the various creation positions and lets them speak for themselves. The personal stories put a human face on a debate that has split Christians from Christians, as well as Christians from non-Christians. I found the discussion of the personal histories of each author as important as the technical positions they defend. This is as much a book about the sociology of science as the details of creation. It lays out how science advances, how Christians practice their faith in their discipline, and how the science establishment responds to propositions that are not in the mainstream.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;Robert K. Prud&#39;homme, Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering; Director, Program in Engineering Biology at Princeton University&lt;/p&gt;" />
