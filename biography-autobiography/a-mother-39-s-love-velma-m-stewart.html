  <title>A Mother&#39;s Love - Velma M Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is to encourage families who may have had the experience of having children in their homes who were broken and discouraged and full of anger and felt as if they could never find love in this life time. This is for children who came from single parent homes or sometimes both parents in the home who had their intention elsewhere, who showed no love to them that they felt left out, outraged, angry, bitter, worthless, as if they were alone. Entering into a new home not knowing what to expect would have their guards up from what they had already experienced in there short lives. This book is to encourage those who may have gone through hardships in their own personal lives, to let you know that there is a way out." />
