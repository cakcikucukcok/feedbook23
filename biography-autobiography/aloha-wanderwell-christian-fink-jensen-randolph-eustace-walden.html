  <title>Aloha Wanderwell - Christian Fink-Jensen, Randolph Eustace-Walden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1922, a 15-year-old girl, fed up with life in a French convent school, answered an ad for a travelling secretary. Tall, blonde, and swaggering with confidence, she might have passed for twenty. She also knew what she wanted: to become the first female to drive around the world. Her name was Aloha Wanderwell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aloha&amp;#39;s mission was foolhardy in the extreme. Drivable roads were scarce and cars were alien to much of the world. The Wanderwell Expedition created a specially modified Model T Ford for the journey that featured  gun scabbards and a sloped back that could fold out to become a darkroom. All that remained was for Aloha to learn how to drive.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aloha became known around the globe. She was photographed in front of the Eiffel Tower, parked on the back of the Sphinx, firing mortars in China, and smiling at a tickertape parade in Detroit. By the age of 25, she had become a pilot, a film star, an ambassador for world peace, and the centrepiece of one of the biggest unsolved murder mysteries in California history. Her story defied belief, but it was true. Every bit of it. Except for her name. The American Aloha Wanderwell was, in reality, the Canadian Idris Hall.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drawing upon Aloha&amp;#39;s diaries and travel logs, as well as films, photographs, newspaper accounts, and previously classified government documents, &lt;i&gt;Aloha Wanderwell&lt;/i&gt; reveals the astonishing story of one of the greatest &amp;#8212; and most outrageous &amp;#8212; explorers of the 1920s.&lt;/p&gt;" />
