  <title>I Am Light - April M. Leverton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While digging palaces in the dirt as a childmotivated by her sister, who only wanted to be free of caring for the younger siblingApril Leverton learned how to use the power of her mind early in life. Unfortunately, she forgot and abandoned these powers, as many of us do. Conditioned by her upbringing, she sought to relieve others of pain by taking on pain herself. She believed cruel words from a teasing brother, who consciously meant no harm. Words emit power to go deep into our cells. Patterns were set, and she journeyed through a few personal hells and back until the light that is within all of us began to shine for April again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any of you who are suffering or who are told there is no cure, no medicine, no pills, or surgery to ease chronic pain and debilitating or even terminal diseases, turn these pages and discover for yourself the power of belief and the ability to induce self-healing. Dr. Bernie Siegel says what April has discovered for herself, Life is a miracle, and we need to not fear trying to achieve our potential and reveal the remarkable creation we and all living things are and that our Creator has built into us the ability to induce self-healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow April as she journeys through her life to find and use the power that we all hold if only we believe. She eliminates fear and welcomes every moment of life. She shares her own discoveries, providing you the simplest road map for you to take and make your own healing journey. Use the power of your mind to create the health you want and also your dreams. April shows how thought patterns created illness and how she used her mind to eradicate those illnesses. Incurable is a word that has no meaning to April.&lt;/p&gt;" />
