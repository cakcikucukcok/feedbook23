  <title>God&#39;s Sinful Nature - Sammie Hooper III</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;God&amp;#39;s &amp;nbsp;Sinful Nature&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; reveals how GOD spoke through men, prophets, and &amp;nbsp;kings; of how His Word will, by all means necessary, go forth; never coming &amp;nbsp;back void. To Christians, it is a direct door to GOD&amp;#39;s truth, both &amp;nbsp;metaphorically and figuratively speaking. Examining both the Old Testament and &amp;nbsp;the New Testament, this book confirms GOD&amp;#39;s Word and shows you His plan of &amp;nbsp;redemption. Sammie Hooper shares his testimony of how GOD transformed his life &amp;nbsp;from the darkest place to His marvelous Light. He exposes some of his struggles &amp;nbsp;and addictive strongholds that GOD delivered him from. This isn&amp;#39;t your ordinary &amp;nbsp;story. It is Sammie&amp;#39;s prayer that this book finds you and ministers to you &amp;nbsp;where GOD will have it. So enjoy and meditate as this book reveals what the &amp;nbsp;world calls the Mystery of God&amp;#39;s Sinful Nature.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Sammie Hooper III&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; was born in Chicago and &amp;nbsp;raised in the projects on the South Side by a single parent. His Mom did her &amp;nbsp;best. The poverty stricken area eventually exposed him to a lot of violence and &amp;nbsp;organized crime at an early age. He chose to become a part of that lifestyle. &amp;nbsp;He committed all sorts of crimes, was shot at the age of seventeen in January, &amp;nbsp;and shot again in March. He was then pronounced dead in the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Chicago Defender&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; newspaper.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; But God had a plan for him, even though Sammie didn&amp;#39;t learn that right away. He ended up in the penitentiary three &amp;nbsp;times, the last time serving nine and a half years which caused him to give his &amp;nbsp;life to GOD. He got his G.E.D. and earned three months of college before being &amp;nbsp;released and moving to Las Vegas. He maintains his relationship with GOD while &amp;nbsp;living in Sin City.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; Sammie had a dream where GOD gave him the &amp;nbsp;title of &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;God&amp;#39;s Sinful Nature&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; as GOD spoke through him as if he was the &amp;nbsp;vessel with a pen.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
