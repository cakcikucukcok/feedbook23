  <title>Chopped, Sprinkled and Ready to Serve - Anita Lazarus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a frank and revealing personal story of the development of spiritual life in Christ.  It is told with warmth, integrity, a quiet humor and a pervasive underlying sense of awe to illustrate how God is able to apply the principles found in the Bible, in the life of the believer.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diversity of life experiences Anita shares with husband Don contributes to the rich tapestry of her spiritual growth from which she is able to inspire others, from all walks of life, to press on in their own journey with Jesus. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of faith level, this book is sure to open up the readers understanding of what God intends him or her to be, and how He makes this possible in the receptive soul.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grounded in Scripture and seen through the lens of personal experience, there are rich and helpful insights, spiritual principles and memorable analogies to encourage fellow travelers.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coriander is one of Asia&#39;s most essential flavors. Anita&#39;s attempts to grow it parallels her spiritual experience. The seed must be bruised and buried for a thrust of living shoots to appear. Only chopped leave release their essence to infuse the food on which they are sprinkled.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in India, these memoirs present principles that are universal for spiritual growth.&lt;p&gt;" />
