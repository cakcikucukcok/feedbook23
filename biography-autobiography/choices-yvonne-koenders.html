  <title>Choices - Yvonne Koenders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;I have always been fascinated by stories from artists, musicians, and actors. Exotic people from faraway places captured my mind. Their struggles, triumphs, and courage I would recall when life was hard. Only years later would I realize I had my own inspiring story to tell. I never dreamed that one day America would be my home. My earlier years were not easy; I was homesick and made foolish choices. Life&#39;s twists and turns brought me back to Holland, where memories came flooding back. The clouds in my head could only be chased away by reliving the past. I had to find the courage to write in a foreign language and expose secrets that still haunted me, Secrets that changed me and were the real reasons I had to leave the country I love. I had to describe how I fled to unknown places without money, friends, or even a plan. But no longer did I think of myself as helpless. I could make my own choices. Maybe I was tossed in the sea of life, but it was up to me to swim and to confront my fears. I found my safe harbor and to my surprise, my husband, who is there for me no matter what. I no longer let circumstances dictate my life. Instead of despair, I now wake up in the morning glad for another day with my husband, our dog, and our home. The girl no one loved is gone; the mother who left her does not matter anymore-nor does the life she once lived. Looking back, I realize that mistakes made were lessons learned. I do not count wealth by money, but by love and friends. I have found that I am very rich indeed. It is my hope that my story will inspire and give hope and courage to others. Every life truly matters!&lt;/div&gt;" />
