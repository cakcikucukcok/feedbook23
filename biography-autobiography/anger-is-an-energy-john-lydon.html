  <title>Anger Is an Energy - John Lydon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the legendary frontman of the Sex Pistols, comes the complete, unvarnished story of his life in his own words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Lydon is an icon&amp;#8212;one of the most recognizable and influential cultural figures of the last forty years. As Johnny Rotten, he was the lead singer of the Sex Pistols-the world&amp;#8217;s most notorious band. The Pistols shot to fame in the mid-1970s with songs such as &amp;#8220;Anarchy in the UK&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;God Save the Queen.&amp;#8221; So incendiary was their impact at the time that in their native England, the Houses of Parliament questioned whether they violated the Traitors and Treasons Act, a crime that carries the death penalty to this day. The Pistols would inspire the formation of numerous other groundbreaking groups and Lydon would become the unlikely champion of a generation clamoring for change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following on the heels of the Pistols, Lydon formed Public Image Ltd (PiL), expressing an equally urgent impulse in his character: the constant need to reinvent himself, to keep moving. From their beginnings in 1978 PiL set the groundbreaking template for a band that continues to challenge and thrive to this day, while also recording one of the eighties most powerful anthems, &amp;#8220;Rise.&amp;#8221; Lydon also found time for making innovative dance records with the likes of Afrika Bambaataa and Leftfield. By the nineties he&amp;#8217;d broadened his reach into other media while always maintaining his trademark invective and wit, most memorably hosting Rotten TV on VH1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Lydon remains a captivating and dynamic figure to this day&amp;#8212;both as a musician, and, thanks to his outspoken, controversial, and from-the-hip opinions, as a cultural commentator. In &lt;em&gt;Anger is an Energy&lt;/em&gt;, he looks back on a life full of incident, from his beginnings as a sickly child of immigrant Irish parents growing up in post-war London to his present status as a vibrant, alternative hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book includes 70 black-and-white and color photos, many which are rare or never-before-seen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
