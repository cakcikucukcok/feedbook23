  <title>Love from Chezeaux: World War One Letters from an American Soldier - Lyn Allyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Grandfather survived artillery fire, bombings, mustard gas, explosions, freezing rain, and sleepless nights all the while moving horse-drawn caissons full of ammunition, sometimes through knee-high mud, to the front lines. He lived to tell about it. His World War I experience is documented in this book.  Personal letters, drawings and true stories in this work portray the life of a young soldier, Private Clarence Augustus Bush, during World War I. While serving in France he wrote home frequently to his bride Margaret.  The 101st Field Artillery of 26th Division from New England, C Battery, abruptly left Camp Devens, Massachusetts, in early September 1917.  Clarence drew portraits of fellow soldiers, French villages and the French countryside. His first-person account of the Second Battle of the Marne was published in the Christian Science Monitor as a series in 1918." />
