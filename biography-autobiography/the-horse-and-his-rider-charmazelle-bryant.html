  <title>The Horse and His Rider - Charmazelle Bryant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In presenting this book, which is a true story, I relate a dramatic chain of events featuring dynamic miracles. During a time frame of just over half a year, pertinent scriptures were quickened to me at a time of impending bankruptcy, after trials of childhood trauma, coping pshychologically with a twenty year old incurable wound, and the need for deliverance from evil spirits. The first chapter of this testimony presents the mystery that the names of books, and the numbers of chapter and verse of scriptures spontaneously came to mind twice in relatively quick succession when I travailed before God to get a word.. I rejected the first word because it baffled me and seemed irrelevant; therefore I tried again, only to receive a different text with exactly the same meaning, which, I believe, defied co-incidence: 
.....and whoever will not receive you, nor heed your words, when you depart from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet. 
Matthew 10:14 (italics mine) similar text from Luke 9:5 
After recording the events of this book, I dwelt on amplifying the personification of the word city in an unrelated scripture: 
.....and you shall be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken, Isaiah 62:12 
A mystery is thus unfolded to those of my readers, who will embrace this testimony of victory in the spirit and echo the words which are the theme of this book, the song of praise and thanksgiving that Moses sang when God brought the Israelites safely through the Red Sea:
	Sing unto the Lord 
	For He has triumphed gloriously 
	The horse and his rider 
	Hath He thrown into the sea 
	Exodus 15:1" />
