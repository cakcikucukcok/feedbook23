  <title>Returned Soldier - James Prascevic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is James&#39; story of life as an infantryman and the unglamorous aftermath of war, when he takes on a different challenge.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;James was a plumber in Victoria, when he decided to enlist as an infantryman in the Australian Defence Force. With 1 RAR he served in Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, where he was confronted with the horrifying effects of Improvised Explosive Devices. James provides an honest, gripping first-hand account of the front lines of combat, and of the training that got him there.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Upon his return from Afghanistan, he completed the Commando Selection and Training Course and most of the Reinforcement Cycle for the Special Forces, but broke his leg in a parachuting incident.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;That was when the &#39;black dog&#39; bit, causing him to be medically discharged from the ADF after almost ten years of service. He was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), major depression, anxiety and alcohol dependence. At first he was silent about it, until he lost his wife, his career and nearly his life. As a result of this, he did fundraising for the Black Dog Institute, set up the website Different Challenge, and crossed Bass Strait in a &#39;tinnie&#39; to raise awareness of mental illness and its often devastating effects." />
