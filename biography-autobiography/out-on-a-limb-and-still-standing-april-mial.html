  <title>Out on a Limb...And Still Standing - April Mial</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Relive the emotional journey towards the production of Fall From Grace through the eyes of April Mial.  This book is her testimony and spiritual journey of accomplishing her dreams, with the desire of positively touching more lives in the future. Although this book is not a how-to book of doing film production, it is an emotional journey of how her lifes experiences and learning from those experiences, allowed her to continually believe in God to make her dreams come true.  
Finish this book of inspiration with a feeling that you can do anything you want V having the right mindset and staying focused.  As the old saying goes, Faith without works is dead.  This book will show you that in order for faith to support your Purpose, you must follow your dreams and put forth the work.
Thus, the motto for Lilac Films, a faith-based production company, is Do dream.  Have faith. Do work. Fulfill Purpose.  God allows each and every one to have a dream.  A dream is a desire that makes us happy.  After realizing our dream, we must incorporate faith that it will come into fruition.  Only until we put forth the work into that dream, will we fulfill our purpose." />
