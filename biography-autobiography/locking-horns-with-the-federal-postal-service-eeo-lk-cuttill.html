  <title>Locking Horns with the Federal (Postal Service) Eeo - Lk Cuttill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was created with the intent to help the reader understand the laws, regulations and guidelines that control the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as you enter the eccentric world of the Postal Services administration process.  You will find that many facts and issues are elusive or abstract at best.  Having this information at hand will give you some enlightenment of what to look for and to watch out for.
  These are the opinions of the writer, personal first hand experiences with EEO counselors, analysts, lawyers and judges and actual complaints that have been filed with the EEOC against the Postal Service and its managers by this author.  Time frames are laid out for easy reading for each stage of the EEO process.
  The reader will be walked through each stage of the process with insights to what forms to fill, time frames to abide by and, with some, a comparison to a real life experience.  In some areas there are EEO advocates; however, locating those individuals are not so simple.  Therefore, this book was written to supply some form of support and guidance for those wandering aimlessly through the tar pit of an EEO process.  For those who have bumbled their way through a complaint and are now leery to march in those steps again, I do hope this book will change your battle fatigued desire to continue on defending your civil rights.  For everyone who settles quickly for less than they believe they deserve or forebodes filing the complaint in whole only supports the Postal Services attempt to manipulate and dominate its employees into submission equal to slavery of today.
  I am with great hopes the unions will give support to this book and may even provide training classes to their representatives to give direction to their members.  There is no dispute from this authors point of view that the Postal Services EEO administrative process is only for a public image. Let us just simply say that, in the mind of the author, this process is a farce as a whole.
  The Postal Service issues several letters, memos and provide stand up talks concerning harassment and discrimination with statements instructing the employee to report such actions to their supervisors and managers with a promise of no retaliation; yet, the top two issues of EEO complaints for 2007 were discrimination and retaliation, respectfully.  During the authors stretch in the EEO process he had sent numerous letters directly to the Postmaster General John Potter and several members of the Board of Governors; however, no one responded directly to the discrimination and retaliation complaints. Thereby, indicating these actions are condoned and that upper management is content with wasting finances to battle the complaint throughout a drawn out process than to make a decent decision to resolve the inhumane treatment of their employees.
 This book is to dispel any thought or hopes that could be harboring in the readers mind that a possible early settlement from management due to their concern or compassion to the negative experience of the violated employee.  It does not mean that a settlement is impossible as I am sure there are some good managers somewhere in the United States that work hard to maintain their own integrity.  But, this book does show you that there are alot that do not and doesnt want the reader to proceed with false hopes.
  The long and short of this book and its subject is to get your mind on target without allowing yourself to accept a disillusioned perspective or false hope.  It is to provide you with knowledge on how to fight for your rights that the Federal EEOC fails to do for you.  It is meant to give you comfort in knowing that you are not the only one being violated and mistreated in the Postal Service; nor, are you the only person that has been lost or confused within this labyrinth of a process created to discourage employees from partaking in.  
  Keep in mind to stay focused, stay within timeframe" />
