  <title>Enter Miss Thang - Brian Edwards, Cindy Crawford, Joan Rivers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Brian Edwards may be a celebrated talent executive, multi-award winning producer, writer and occasional performer, but to friends such as Cindy Crawford and Whoopi Goldberg, he is known quite simply as &lt;em&gt;Miss Thang.&lt;/em&gt; The late, great Joan Rivers wrote the foreword and Crawford penned the introduction to his recent autobiography, &lt;em&gt;Enter Miss Thang,&lt;/em&gt; (published by Archway Publishing) which became a national best seller and ends the year as the most honored LGBT Non-Fiction Book of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p &gt;&lt;em&gt;Enter Miss Thang&lt;/em&gt; received top honors for &lt;em&gt;Best Humor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Best Gay &amp; Lesbian Non-Fiction&lt;/em&gt; at The &lt;em&gt;USA Best Book Awards, &lt;/em&gt;(presented by USA Book News), which rounded out the current book awards season, where Edwards also earned a total of ten national and international awards in various categories such as Humor, in addition to dominating the field of LGBT Non-Fiction with wins at The International Book Awards, The Beverly Hills Book Awards and The National Indie Excellence Awards, where it was also named Best Autobiography of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brian is the perfect example of a true friendand to so many. Enter Miss Thang is his story, filled with humor and passion for his work and the people he loves the most. A diva indeed, but it&#39;s a title he&#39;s definitely earned by managing to survive almost thirty years in Hollywood, cushioned by intelligence, flamboyance, gut instinct, loyalty, and, most of all, his sense of humor.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vanessa Williams,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multi-platinum recording artist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and star of stage, television, and film&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this book, Brian Edwards sets an example of giving and commitment that creates a standard for all of us to follow as to what a friend should truly be. I&#39;m so proud of his life and legacy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Haskell,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;former worldwide head of television&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at the William Morris Agency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brian Edwards is my favorite diva of all time. I have worked with him on many Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremonies, which have given us both tears of happiness and tears from the laughter he brings out in me when working on these legendary events.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ana Martinez,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;producer for Hollywood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk of Fame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Brian is one of the kindest, funniest, and most supportive people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He always takes good care of me stateside, like my fairy godmother! It&#39;s clear to see just how treasured, loved and respected Brian is and deservedly so.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matt Cardle,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;multi-platinum recording artist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Having gotten to know Brian over the years I have come to realize his own personal story is as interesting as those of many of his famous friends and clients. He&#39;s fiercely loyal, outrageously funny, and generous to a fault.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pam Tillis,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CMA and Grammy Awardwinning recording artist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Enter Miss Thang encapsulates more than a man&#39;s wild and wonderful adventures in Hollywood, but reveals a dynamic and brilliant colleague and friend with a zest for life and all things fun and fabulous.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirjana Van Blaricom,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;president of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Press Academy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have known Brian for almost twenty years. His enthusiasm and support of talent in this industry is incomparable. No one even comes close! He&#39;s also a dedicated friend who has always been there for me and so many others, when it truly mattered the most.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
