  <title>Absolute Optimist - Menna Elfyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eluned Phillips was a passionate woman who ignited equally passionate responses in others. The second woman ever to wear the National Eisteddfod crown – Wales’ most prestigious Welsh language literary prize – she is the only woman to have won it twice. Unfortunately, her writing life was blemished by rumours over her work’s authorship.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unusual among Welsh women of her generation, Eluned embraced an unconventional lifestyle which took her to pre-war London&amp;#13;
and Paris, where she met artists Augustus John, Edith Piaf, and Pablo Picasso, as well as the writer Dewi Emrys, the dissolute ex-preacher and poet whose biography she published in 1971. In France she also fell in with a group of idealistic Bretons who introduced her to romantic love and nationalist politics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is an affectionate and yet critical biography of an unsung heroine of Welsh literature during a time of great change – taking her from rural Carmarthenshire to bohemian Paris and urban Los Angeles. She was often frowned upon, but never less than true to herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Award-winning poet Menna Elfyn examines Phillips’ life and work and argues convincingly that Eluned’s poetry is undoubtedly hers and more than worthy of two Crowns. &lt;i&gt;Absolute Optimist&lt;/i&gt; was shortlisted for Wales Book of the Year on publication in Welsh. It has been translated for Honno by Elinor Wyn Reynolds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
