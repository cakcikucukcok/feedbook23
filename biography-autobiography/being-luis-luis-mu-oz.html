      <meta name="description" content="A voice for those who were silenced.This is a powerful account of a life that reflects recent Chilean history from the 1960s to the present though the author&#39;s extraordinary personal experiences. It recounts his magical, sometimes harsh, childhood, his development as a left-wing activist, his arrest and torture by the military regime and eventual exile to England.It is a story of love and survival in a time when the young were prepared to sacrifice everything, including their lives, for a better future. When ordinary people did great things and dared to dream great dreams. Uplifting, at times devastating, this story will move everyone who reads it. It speaks for a lost generation who paid the ultimate price for their ideals." />
