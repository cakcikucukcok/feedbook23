  <title>I Was a Government Licensed Medical-Marijuana Salesman Busted by the Federal Government - My Life Stories - Michael David Aronov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book outlines the many experiences that I have been faced with in my life from birth to age 48. Several stories are quite comical, others are tragic and sad, but each and every one of them is true. It talks about my experiences with drugs, alcohol and death. It tells of my devotion to my family and to the less fortunate in this world. I have spent countless hours donating my rare blood, platelets, bone marrow and serums. This book tells the reason why I did this all my life, and what I have experienced with several business ventures. My first business was a plumbing company, which I started fresh out of high school. I was in business for over 17 years. I have spent several years managing rock bands, acting, and inventing. My most successful invention Plink, has been on grocery store shelves for over 12 years. I take great pride in what I do and I have always strived for perfection. I believe that persistence is the key to happiness and happiness leads to prosperity. Although I am not a rich man, I have been very successful in my life. I have owned 13 brand new cars, 3 Harley Davidson motorcycles, 5 boats, 5 houses, 4 vacant lots, 38 used cars, and I have had 56 jobs. Many of my success stories are described in detail throughout my book.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The most interesting part of my book is my experience with my most recent company, Arizona Company Medical. Through Arizona Company Medical, I spent 3 years of my life furnishing Medical-Marijuana to hundreds of patients around the USA who were suffering from AIDS, Multiple Sclerosis, Cancer, Migraines, Anorexia, Glaucoma and many other diseases. Medical-Marijuana can be prescribed to ease the pain and suffering that accompanies these diseases. Also included in my book is the true story of how I was issued a Cannabis and Controlled Substance Dealers License from the Arizona Department of Revenue, how the Federal Government collected taxes from the money I made in my business, but then busted me for distributing the same substance that I was licensed for. Details of my business and the Medical-Marijuana bust are outlined in my story. Also included are several real letters from patients who were customers of Arizona Company Medical, who wrote to me to inform me of their progress now that they have the appropriate access to their much needed medication, Medical-Marijuana. My goal is to work towards the legalization of Medical-Marijuana across the USA, and to get the proper help to those that need this medicine. May the Medical-Marijuana movement win the rights for the fight for the people of this great nation.&lt;/P&gt;" />
