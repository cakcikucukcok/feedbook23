  <title>Voices by the Sea - Medardo M. Panlilio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life, especially the examined life, is always a dialogue whether this is between two persons or between a person and his conscience. It always involves a question and answer, two feet carrying a person on the seashore of life in search of meaning. The book is about a dialogue of two friends, Mel and Ma-isha who started their dialogue by the seashore with a recognition that many people get waylaid in life not so much in the big issues of life which great minds have reflected on but in the ordinary things like eating and drinking,
bathing, working, and living with others. And yes, religion! Because they are so common, the ordinary things in life are taken so routinely and for granted that in the process the extraordinary in them is lost. The baby is thrown with the bath water! Mel and Ma-isha, having just gone out of school, engaged in a dialogue not so much to have a final say on the subjects that they discussed but to lead the yearnings in the hearts of people caught in the spreading desert of life to the extraordinary which is a shimmering oasis in the midst of the
ordinary for the tired travelers of life to have their fill. They do not need to look beyond the stars to quench their thirst for life. All they have to do is to open their hearts and minds to the extraordinary in the ordinary things in life. The divine is closer to our hearts than we often think!" />
