  <title>Is It Really Just a Small World? - Sandra Boyce Ghost</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When two neighbors who live in Bucksnort, Tennessee unexpectedly meet in New York City, they usually say the same thing, Well, its a small world! This seems to be the phrase that always accompanies a remarkable coincidence. But what if it isnt coincidence at all? What if these extreme happenings could be orchestrated by God, to get our attention, to further His plan for our lives, or as some kind of heavenly protection? Have doubts about that? Well, &lt;em&gt;Is It Really Just A Small World? &lt;/em&gt;promises to show one coincidence after another, all laced together in the life of one woman with the love of a heavenly valentine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autobiography of Sandra Ghost reads like a page-turning soap opera when as a teen she tries to swim upstream in a troubled home life and uses marriage as an escape from the parental river of alcohol. Physical abuse ends this union and a second marriage promises all her dreams will come true, until she finds herself desperately trying to win her new husbands approval to no avail. She feels planted in the country with the crops and a newborn baby, and tries to imitate the housewives on TV, submissively trying to just tie a starched apron around her troubled mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fluke of circumstances, Sandy is thrust into singing onstage. This occurrence blossoms into a surprising career as a nightclub entertainer with bookings all over the US and Canada, appearances on television, plus a recording contract. And this is when the miracles begin to happen...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, fasten your spiritual seat belt, get prepared for the ups and downs of a heavenly roller coaster ride that will leave you breathless with what the world would deem to be remarkable coincidences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(While this autobiography is told with humor and candor, it reflects solid and astonishing answers to prayer. When there are encounters with others whose stories of miracles also cross the path of the author, she has included affidavits by those involved to speak of the veracity of the episode.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
