  <title>Franzi - Bernard Willimann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With a great sense of adventure, Franzi Willimann lives a happy and successful life. Now in his seventies, this retired corporate executive, Army veteran, husband, and father of four, is a proud American. But he began life in Switzerland in the 1930s, the child of hard-working hoteliers who taught him to love life, to cherish his faith and his family, and to give generously of himself every single day. Beloved by his family and a multitude of devoted friends, success, for this most happy fellow, is a divine mix of the dark and the light, the joys and sorrows of everyday living. Told with extraordinary humor and simplicity, his story offers each one of us a roadmap to lasting joy and contentment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Franzi Willimann and his family will show you, the secret to true happiness is not in what we do, where we live, or how much we achieve, nor is it found in physical beauty, wealth, or social status. True happiness is created in tender minutia, in the small details of lives lived with devoted attention to relationships, to humble service, and to love. Enjoy the story of Opa, a genuine treasure of a life bestowing its riches on all those it touches as it unfolds  one glorious day, one devoted hour, one joyously savored moment at a time. &lt;/p&gt;" />
