  <title>Changing the Gift - Fabienne Gassmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every book starts with an idea that transforms into an outline, and only later becomes a story. No one ever writes a book alone. This book was written in such a way that my daily ups and downs were constantly used as my eyes to see inspiration around me, connecting my personal experiences in life to the things my eyes saw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this book is to emphasize the deep spiritual values that one has in oneself. It is a collection of short stories about my daysstories about how I feel or what inspired me on that day. It reflects my vision and dreams, and I hope that as you read this book you, as a reader, will be inspired too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
