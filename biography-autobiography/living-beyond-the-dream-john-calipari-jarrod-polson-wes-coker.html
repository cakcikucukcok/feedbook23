  <title>Living Beyond the Dream - John Calipari, Jarrod Polson, Wes Coker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jarrod Polsons journey to the University of Kentucky began with a dream in elementary school. Living beyond the Dream offers an inside look into Polsons life as he describes that dream to play basketball for his beloved Wildcats.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;This memoir narrates the lows and highs and speaks to the lessons Polson learned throughout college. In a world of talent and fame, he understands the choices one makes are more important than the gifts one has been given.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Praise for Living beyond the Dream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarrod Polson is Kentucky basketball. [He] turned down scholarships to other Division 1 schools to live out his dream of playing for the Wildcats. He was given little chance of playing  But not only did he play, he was an integral part of UKs 2012 National Championship. To me there is something more important. Jarrod Polson lives what he believes.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Cameron Mills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following UKs miraculous run in the 2014 NCAA Tournament, Jarrod Polson and I were given the opportunity to visit thousands of  school kids throughout Kentucky. Those kids saw that a UK National Champion who got to live his dream can be humble, patient, and kind and still be a champion. You will love getting to know him and Him through Polsons book Living beyond the Dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Sheppard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my time here at Kentucky, Ive been fortunate to have been around some of the strongest character kids in the country. JP is at the top of that list, his faith in how he lives his life, his dedication to team and winning spirit made it fun and a joy to coach. He will always be one of my favorite wildcats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny Payne&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarrod Polson writes about the honor to wear a Kentucky uniform and the thrill of being a part of BBN.&lt;/p&gt;
