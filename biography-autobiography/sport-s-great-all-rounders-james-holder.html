  <title>Sport’S Great All-Rounders - James Holder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On July 3, 1958, Arthur Milton and MJK Smith opened the batting for England in the third Test against New Zealand at Headingley. Coincidentally, Milton was the last Englishman to play football and cricket for England and Smith the last Englishman to play rugby and cricket for England. 
However, both before and after that Test in 1958, there have been a number of sportsmen and sportswomen who have represented their country in more than one sport. In this book are listed biographical details of 172 sportsmen and sportswomen, including some of whom are disabled, who have excelled at more than one sport. 
Some, such as CB Fry and Denis Compton, will be well-known; others, such as Aramugam Vijiaratnam, who represented Singapore in four sports and Ken Hough, who played three different sports for three different countries may be less well-known. But everyone listed has excelled at more than one sport and this book serves to recognize their achievements." />
