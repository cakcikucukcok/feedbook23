  <title>Grandmother&#39;s Story - Lin Guifeng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book unfolds the true-life story of a Singaporean grandmother. It spans the entire years of her life, beginning with her birth in 1943 during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore and ending in the new millennium of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book reveals periods of Lin&#39;s difficult and near-death infancy, her underprivileged and struggling childhood, her impoverished teenage years and her emergence from a poor young woman to a successful educated career woman and happily married woman of the 70&#39;s, 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s. After the year 2000, her life took an unexpected turn and she suffered severe financial loss and emotional trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her family life is filled with unbearable sadness and unspeakable pain. In addition to their emotional agony, Lin and her husband lost half a million dollars of their hard-earned life savings and retirement funds through the inconsiderate actions of their loved ones. Their subsequent struggle to stay financially afloat and independent is fraught with tears and heartache, yet she overcame these obstacles to remain sane and normal to tell her story for her children and grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Grandmother&#39;s Story&quot; is a poignant tale of what it means to be a daughter, a sister, a wife, a mother and a grandmother, told simply and sincerely. Do you want to hear? Read on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
