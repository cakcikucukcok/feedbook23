  <title>Namo - Aroop Datta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Narendra Damodardas Modi stands for hope. Hope for billions of Indians. Love him, Hate him, NaMo is Indias last chance. His story fascinates almost every community in India and many abroad. His ever growing huge fan following has made him the most-searched political personality on Google in 2014. While several books have already been written about the Man, very few have been written about him by a true- fan, one of several Millions across the world. This honest endeavor written in totally non-controversial style, on his struggle of early years, rise as a CM of Gujarat and his stupendous success over a 13 year stint, his magnanimous election campaign to lead India to an almost single handedly historic verdict to his becoming Indias fifteenth Prime Minister is purely directed at his fans to enjoy the wonderful moments of their truest Leader. His rise hasnt been a fairy tale story to say the least. Its been an uphill struggle, battling his way to the top, fighting several battles both within and outside including his media love-hate in India and abroad. NaMo has only one way forward, to take India to a glorious future and convert his multi Trillion-dollar dream of India into a reality.
The book contains an interesting foreward by Shantanu Guha Ray, a Wharton-trained business journalist who scooped the Coal Scam in 2011 and won many national and international awards for a series of investigations.
A unique Chapter on Shri Modis visit to Siachen with some rarely-seen visuals will form part of the Visual Delight for all and one. Several images of Shri Modi have been included in the Book. Enjoy reading NaMo A Name, A Cult. A Visual Delight." />
