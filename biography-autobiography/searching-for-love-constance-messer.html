  <title>Searching for Love - Constance Messer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I am so excited to have the opportunity to share the true story of Sonexay Chantasone with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a considerable amount of time to get the story into print due to the fact that the main character was very occupied with learning about the new country he was in and couldn&#39;t sit still and tell me all about his life and what it meant for him to be here. It was very emotional for him, When finally I printed the pages he would remember another detail and it would change the order of events. Being a busy Pastor&#39;s wife, I just couldn&#39;t sit for hours with Sonexay, but finally after many changes and order of events, we have the story ready for you to read, &quot;Searching For Love.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
