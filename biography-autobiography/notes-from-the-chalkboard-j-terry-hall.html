  <title>Notes from the Chalkboard - J. Terry Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Notes From The Chalkboard: Teacher Tales From The Mountains Of North Carolina, I have attempted to capture the essence of North Carolina mountain teachers and administrators.  It is a tragedy for people to live to be eighty, ninety or even one hundred years old, and when they die, to allow their wonderful experiences to die with them.  
	Oral history is rapidly dying across our nation.  With the explosion of instant communication, we have lost the art of passing on everyday events of interest to future generations.  There was a time, not very long ago, when families would sit around the fireplace and relate memories from days gone by.  Regrettably, that day is long in the past.
	Thus, the idea for this book was formed.  The purpose is to provide an avenue for common everyday folks, who would most likely never be mentioned in history books, to relate memories that are meaningful in their lives and allow these same memories to be passed on through time." />
