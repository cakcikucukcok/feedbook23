  <title>A Stirring of the Air, a Shifting of the Light - Wayne Luckmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wayne Luckmann looks back on growing up in Milwaukees South Side during the 1930s and 1940s, sharing hard-fought lessons from his childhood and beyond in this touching memoir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;A Stirring of the Air, a Shifting of the Light&lt;/i&gt;, Luckmann celebrates his family, childhood friends, and many others who have played meaningful roles in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His recollections include Margaret and Her Children in which he shares the rich heritage of his mothers European family who immigrated to America at the start of the last century. Their deep, abiding loveoften unexpressedhelp turn him into the man he ultimately becomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In My Fathers Keeper, he explores his fathers side of the family, showing how various relatives influenced his relationship with his dad. This side of the family helps shape his attitudes, perceptions, and relationships with others, especially his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These recollections seek to preserve moments and memories of things past that were rich in flesh and blood and bone. Although they are now only flickering neural images, they made Luckmann who he is, and they have profound meaning for anyone seeking a bridge to the past and an understanding of self.&lt;/p&gt;" />
