  <title>The Boy Billionaire: Mark Zuckerberg In His Own Words - George Beahm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest Person of the Year named by &lt;I&gt;Time&lt;/I&gt; magazine since Charles Lindbergh in 1927, has grown in prominence as rapidly as the company he founded in a Harvard dorm room in 2004. The public&#39;s appetite for insight into Facebook and its founder seems nearly insatiable. Curiosity abounds regarding Zuckerberg&#39;s personality and management style, since fictional Hollywood portrayals and Wall Street whispers have painted a broad-strokes portrait of the young CEO that is at best only a fraction of the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Given Facebook&#39;s current $58 billion market capitalization and 845 million worldwide users, there is clearly more to Zuckerberg than any over-simplified caricature could convey. &lt;I&gt;The Boy Billionaire: Mark Zuckerberg In His Own Words&lt;/I&gt; is the first and only book to detail the visionary thoughts and opinions of Facebook&#39;s founder entirely through direct quotations from Zuckerberg himself. It is the most intimate and most authoritative look at the man behind Facebook&#39;s once-a-generation success, the tech heir-apparent to Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Like those two pioneering entrepreneurs, Zuckerberg has proven to be a calculating and sometimes ruthless strategist with a steadfast commitment to his vision. Facebook exists somewhere between a social utility and a model of 21st century business, leading next-gen tech companies through an economic climate still scarred by the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, but increasingly driven by the inevitability of a global marketplace built on social media technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Facebook&#39;s potential is unknown, but the key to its success depends on Zuckerberg&#39;s own ideas and vision. This book serves up his most thought-provoking insights, as researched and chosen by George Beahm, the &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; bestselling editor of &lt;I&gt;I, Steve: Steve Jobs In His Own Words&lt;/I&gt;. &lt;I&gt;The Boy Billionaire: Mark Zuckerberg In His Own Words&lt;/I&gt; provides crucial illumination of Zuckerberg and the company he&#39;s created, emphasizing insights, business strategies, and lessons learned. It is essential reading for people who seek innovative solutions applicable to their business, regardless of size, and makes an ideal gift or reference item for anyone interested in this newest of American business icon.&lt;/div&gt;" />
