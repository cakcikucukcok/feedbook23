  <title>You Can Take the Girl out of Chicago … - Dorothy Sinclair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Often funny, sometimes poignant short stories recall the authors experiences as a rebellious young girl from Chicago. Growing up in the upper middle-class neighborhood of South Shore, she perpetually feels like a misfit, yearning to get out. Only with her mothers much younger sister, her Aunt Flo, does she feel a comfortable sense of belonging. These memoirs take her out of the midwest and into the worlds of theatre and literature on the East Coast while the recurring theme of her supportive, witty, opinionated, progressive aunt remains with her and runs throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a sense of humor, who has ever longed to be in another place in another time, will appreciate Sinclairs wit and vivid descriptions of the world as she knew it during the mid-decades of the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These hilarious, sensitive stories cut right to the bone. A terrific read. &lt;br /&gt;Adele Scheele, Ph.D, Career Coach, Author of &lt;em&gt;Skills for Success&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
