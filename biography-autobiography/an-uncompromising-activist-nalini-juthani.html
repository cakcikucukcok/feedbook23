  <title>An Uncompromising Activist - Nalini Juthani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When author Nalini Juthani and her new husband, Viren, left India for the United States in June of 1970, neither they nor their families knew this adventure would continue for a lifetime, that America would be the place where they would fulfill their dreams, raise a family, and find a new home. In &lt;i&gt;An Uncompromising Activist&lt;/i&gt;, Juthani shares the stories from her life as a woman, daughter, wife, immigrant, medical educator, mother, and grandmother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These essays, with photographs included, provide a glimpse of what it was like for the first twenty-four years of growing up in India as a woman and how the loss of her father at an early age affected her and her future. &lt;i&gt;An Uncompromising Activist&lt;/i&gt; narrates her experiences of getting her first job in New York, her first car, her first house, and her first American friend. The stories show the courage of a woman who became a trendsetter in a new country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspiring and touching, the essays describe the influence Juthani had on the lives of others while overcoming cultural barriers. It also offers the story of the Ghevaria-Juthani families and provides a history for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
