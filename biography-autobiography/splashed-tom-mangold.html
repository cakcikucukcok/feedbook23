      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tom Mangold is known to millions as the face of BBC TV&#39;s flagship current affairs programme Panorama and as its longest-serving reporter. Splashed! is the &#39;antidote to the conventional journalist&#39;s autobiography&#39; - a compelling, hilarious and raucous revelation of the events that marked an extraordinary life in journalism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mangold describes his National Service in Germany, where he worked part-time as a smuggler, through his years in the 1950s on Fleet Street&#39;s most ruthless newspapers, a time when chequebook journalism ruled and shamelessness was a major skill. Recruited by the BBC, he spent forty years as a broadcaster, developing a reputation for war reporting and major investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From world exclusives with fallen women in the red-top days to chaotic interviews with Presidents, Splashed! offers a rare glimpse of the personal triumphs and disasters of a life in reporting, together with fascinating revelations about the stories that made the headlines on Mangold&#39;s remarkable journey from print to Panorama.&lt;/p&gt;" />
