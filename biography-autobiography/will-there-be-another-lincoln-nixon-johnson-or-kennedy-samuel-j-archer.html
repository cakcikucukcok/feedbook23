  <title>Will There Be Another Lincoln, Nixon, Johnson or Kennedy? - Samuel J Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Will There Be Another Lincoln, Nixon, Johnson or Kennedy is a narrative on the injustices served to a minority worker in the Building and Construction Industry. The author reviews his experience as a construction worker and the problems he encountered obtaining work. The author is of the belief that the problem is highly attributive to the pigmentation of his skin and  his racial ethnicity. He incorporates the philosophies, the ideals and the ideologies of the United States, and what this country stands for as his basis for clearly stating the unfairness brought  upon him; thus resulting in financial woes for him and his family.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The story sheds light on the &quot;Racial Web&quot; of happenings both within and outside the immediate work place in our society, with
special emphasis on the Construction Industry. The socio-equalitarianism inadequateness and injustices within the industry which goes relatively unnoticed by the general American public. He uses references from past and current happenings in our society, both of humane and inhumane nature, to establish an imaginary high standard of achievement in a &quot;Just&quot; society.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The author sees it as befitting and appropriate to dialogue and elaborate on life&#39;s interaction as it relates to happenings in New
York City, it being the general location where he actually encountered his bitter experiences; despite it being notarized, and proclaimed as the &quot;number one humanitarian capital of the new world&quot;. Also aiding as a stimulative motivator, as well as a
beacon of hope for this venture, is the author&#39;s firm belief in equality of humanities, especially when factoring in his son as well as peers of his son&#39;s future into consideration.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A marvelous, exceptional, creative and a well written book, intriguingly conceived and well researched work, addressing 
concerns of the status quo, with profound effect emphasis on the reaffirmation and the revitalization of Affirmative Action.&lt;/P&gt;" />
