  <title>You Don&#39;t Look Like a Preacher&#39;s Wife - Lorena Keck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Is a preachers wife: a) perfect b) a listener c) gregarious or d) scary? &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The book, You Dont Look Like a Preachers Wife addresses these issues. This is a book of antidotes, experiences through which the author has grown closer to God, has learned to love and learned to cope with loneliness. Being married to a preacher teaches one to accept ones self and others--to accept living in different areas with different cultures and climates.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book is heart warming and soul searching. You may weep as Lorena gives away the shoes shes wearing, or smile as you picture the preachers wife greeting parishioners while holding her squirming cockapoo. Your heart may beat faster as you think about hiding from a gunman.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Church members want to understand the ministers wife beyond her Sunday professional role. A young woman enamored by the marriage proposal of a charming seminarian, should make sure her first love is for the Lord.  Many heartaches and tears would have been eased if Lorena would have know these many lessons she learned through experience. Many church goers wish their pastors wife knew these lessons.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Read You Dont Look Like a Preachers Wife to understand how you as a pastors wife or a member in her congregation can reach out and touch each other with Gods love.&lt;/P&gt;" />
