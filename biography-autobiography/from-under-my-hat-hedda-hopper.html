  <title>From Under My Hat - Hedda Hopper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hedda Hopper came into this world screaming, and she liked to say that she never stopped. Decades after, she could still out-shout any producer in Hollywood, and she wasn’t afraid to do whatever it took to get her way. One of the most glamorous stars of the silent era, Hopper became one of the most notorious gossip columnists in the country, whose acid wit and razor-sharp pen fearlessly attacked the biggest names in Hollywood. In From Under My Hat, she tells her story as only she can.
From her birth in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, to her early days as a Broadway understudy to her rise and fall as a Hollywood starlet, Hopper tells the story of the golden age of the movie business with candor and grace.  At the height of her popularity, 20,000,000 read Hopper’s column. Reading her searing autobiography, it’s easy to see why.
Hedda Hopper is portrayed by Judy Davis in the Ryan Murphy TV series Feud about Joan Crawford and Bette Davis." />
