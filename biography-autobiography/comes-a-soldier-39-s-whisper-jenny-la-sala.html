  <title>Comes a Soldier&#39;s Whisper - Jenny La Sala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Golden Warrior and the bravest man I ever knew.
When Dave and I fought together, no matter how severe the action, he
would put his hand on my shoulder, and it gave me a calming effect.
He was as fi erce in battle as he was gentle in friendship.
Charles E. Eckman,
101st Airborne Screaming Eagles
Holtwood, Pennsylvania
I remember David as a kind, soft-spoken man and was intrigued that he
was also Colonel Michaelis radio operator. All of these men were larger
than life! Little is known about Michealis because he was in command of
the 502nd for such a short, yet important, time.
Peter J. K. Hendrikx, author of
Orange is the Color of the Day
Pictorial history of the 101st Airborne Liberation of Holland

Madame Rolle, owner of Chateau Rollea castle located in Champs
outside of Bastogne, Belgium, and was designated as the headquarter
command post for the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment when she was
a young girlremembered our father operating his radio in her foyer,
and said, He was a nice young fellow who kept talking to someone
named Roger.
Madame Rolle
This collection of letters, written by a young 101st Airborne paratrooper
soldier to his sweetheart from 1943-1945, is so personal and matter-offact
that I almost forgot that David Clinton Tharp was only one of millions
of heroes made by World War II. David Tharp certainly deserves a book
like this in his honor, and it deserves to be read and praised. It is a mustread
for every American, and especially for veterans of war.
