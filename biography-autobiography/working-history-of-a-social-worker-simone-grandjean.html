  <title>Working History of a Social Worker - Simone Grandjean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After working 20 years as a dressmaker, in 1980, aged 49 years, I proudly
received a Degree in Social Studies from the University of Sydney.
Then, in 1985 I obtained a Masters Degree in Social Work from the
University of New South Wales.
My first job as a Social Worker, in 1980 was with the Italian Welfare
Centre (CO.AS.IT.) where I stayed for four and a half years. Then six
months in a Nursing Home in London. Then one year with the Department
of Immigration in Sydney and Parramatta. Then from 1987 I worked for the
Aged Care Assessment Team attached to the Bankstown Hospital. I retired
in March 2007 on my 76th birthday.
I enjoyed my work. I liked many of my clients and most of my
co-workers.
I remember some of the cases I had to deal with; many were unusual,
some were sad, some impossible and a few amusing, but all were interesting
as no two people are alike.
In CO.AS.IT. I had a whole range of problems to deal with. All the
clients were Italian migrants mainly from a Peasant background. They
spoke mostly their native dialects mixed with Italian. The greatest number
came from the south of Italy (PUGLIA, CALABRIA, SICILY, and around
NAPLES) and from the poorer parts of the North (Veneto).
I spoke Italian and soon understood the different dialects although I
never spoke any of them. So I was able to deal with people from the different
provinces.
At The Department of Immigration I was in charge of several bi-lingual
Welfare Officers covering Arabic, Greek, Spanish, Lebanese, Polish, all
8
Simone Grandjean
Yugoslav languages, the Filipino dialects, Chinese, Vietnamese and Italian;
my native language is French.
I was also able to use interpreters for those times when a person spoke
something else, such as Portuguese, Armenian or Assyrian, etc . . .
In England and Bankstown 99% of my clients were the elderly, the
greatest percentage were of English or Anglo Australian background, but also
of many other nationalities and ethnic backgrounds.
So, there have been cases relating to family relationship, children, marital
problems, psychiatric problems, immigration, needing information on a large
range of subjects: health, death, work, financial problems, sexual problems,
etc . . . and cultural differences.
But first I was a Social Work Student." />
