This is a biography and autobiography with a big difference as the normal, and will capture you from the first word to the last.
In the first part the manipulation of the system and the innocent as narrate by, I am Anonymous. The brutality involved the organized crime, and the abuse of the innocent.
In the second part we are the narrators and the story continues how the same innocent were abused, but with a difference. Our stories are to be found in the thousands of research documents of which we were the narrators. These narrations are a 24 hour non-stop fact, and are there for the world to read, see and hear about it. We still manipulate the systems and use and abuse the innocent as a stepping stone to gain the sympathy of the world." />
