  <title>MacArthur in Asia - Hiroshi Masuda, Reiko Yamamoto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;General Douglas MacArthur&#39;s storied career is inextricably linked to Asia. His father, Arthur, served as Military Governor of the Philippines while Douglas was a student at West Point, and the younger MacArthur would serve several tours of duty in that country over the next four decades, becoming friends with several influential Filipinos, including the country&#39;s future president, Emanuel L. Quezon. In 1935, he became Quezon&#39;s military advisor, a post he held after retiring from the U.S. Army and at the time of Japan&#39;s invasion of 1941. As Supreme Commander for the Southwest Pacific, MacArthur led American forces throughout the Pacific War. He officially accepted Japan&#39;s surrender in 1945 and would later oversee the Allied occupation of Japan from 1945 to 1951. He then led the UN Command in the Korean War from 1950 to 1951, until he was dismissed from his post by President Truman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;In &lt;em&gt;MacArthur in Asia&lt;/em&gt;, the distinguished Japanese historian Hiroshi Masuda offers a new perspective on the American icon, focusing on his experiences in the Philippines, Japan, and Korea and highlighting the importance of the general&#39;s staff-the famous &quot;Bataan Boys&quot; who served alongside MacArthur throughout the Asian arc of his career-to both MacArthur&#39;s and the region&#39;s history. First published to wide acclaim in Japanese in 2009 and translated into English for the first time, this book uses a wide range of sources-American and Japanese, official records and oral histories-to present a complex view of MacArthur, one that illuminates his military decisions during the Pacific campaign and his administration of the Japanese Occupation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
