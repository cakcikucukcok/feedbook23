	Whether driving a big team, moving a herd of cattle into a holding pen, seeing a newborn colt get up for the first time and suck from its mother, riding in a race, jumping over four foot tall poles, do specialty riding with disabled people, or watch a young horse you raised perform well as these women in this book fulfilled either their dream or helped someone else achieve theirs. 
	You will learn that several of these women conquered many obstacles; some of illness or injury and yet upon recover, acquired a good horse and continued doing something they loved so dearly. 
	Also in this book are places/ good trails listed where you too could go to ride or hike. It is stated where they are and what to expect as you begin your journey. They are written with clarity that you also will be able to see these beautiful places in your mind. 
	Enjoy your journey as you read and learn. 
Enjoy the Journey is encouraging and compassionate. It reminded me that time spent on a good horse would be well worth the investment. (K. Hall, writer of non fiction novels)" />
