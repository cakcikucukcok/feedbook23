  <title>Redemption in Paradise - Shane Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;THERE ARE NO right or wrong choices. If your choices do
not lead to wisdom, you will get other chances. In this life - or in
another,&quot; says Gunananda, a fi fth century sage, somewhere in
Sigiriya.
&lt;P&gt;
This prediction follows a motley collection of tourists arriving in
present-day Sri Lanka on a four-day tour. Aggressive Australian
journalist Sarah has troubling visions of a past life. She desires
John, an idealist from Vancouver writing a thesis on fear.
American expatriates Margaret and Robert Keane are embroiled
in a love-hate relationship, haunted by the memory of their dead
son. Returning emigrant Lionel is anxiously seeking the country he
left behind. And burly Jefferson conceals the secret that brought
him east, whilst liberally indulging an appetite for prostitutes.
Escorting them is hard-drinking Asoka, struggling to survive the
hardships of life in the war-torn island. As they step on the tour
bus, each traveller unknowingly makes an appointment with
destiny.
&lt;P&gt;
Beginning with a roadside shooting of terrorist suspects, the tour
meanders through Kelaniya, Dambulla and the rock fortress of
Sigiriya, culminating in Kandy. Then things go terribly wrong and
unexpected events force them to a temple in the jungle and a
meeting with the mysterious Buddhist nun Gunanandani.
&lt;P&gt;
Mix in psychometry, a ghostly image captured on camera, arms
smugglers and a tattered band of military deserters, and the
travellers are swept into a confl ict that was never part of their
itinerary.
&lt;P&gt;
In the tragic climax at the crumbling temple, valuable lessons
are learned, leaving lives indelibly changed. And the prophecy of
Gunananda is fulfilled." />
