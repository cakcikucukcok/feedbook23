  <title>Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi - Itzchak Weismann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Abd al-Rahman al-Kawakibi (1855&amp;#150;1902) was one of the most articulate and original proponents of the reformist ideas underlying modern Islamic thought, as well as an early precursor of Arab nationalism. A journalist, political activist and author, he fiercely resisted arbitrary government, exploitation of the poor, and ulama and Sufis who supported the absolutist rule. Adhering to the reformist ideal of a return to the scriptures and the model of the ancestors (salaf) as a way to free Islam from the shackles of tradition and accommodate it to modernity, he suggested as remedy to these ills a democratic responsible government, the separation of religion and politics, and an Arab spiritual Caliphate.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is the first full scale biography of Kawakibi in any European language based on the memoirs of family and colleagues, archival material and his writings. It combines a narrative of his life set against the political and social realities of late Ottoman Aleppo, with a fresh look at his articles and books which considers their literary form &amp;#151; the independent journal, an imaginary secret conference held in Mecca, and a scientific study of the nature of tyranny &amp;#151; as part of their message.&lt;/div&gt;" />
