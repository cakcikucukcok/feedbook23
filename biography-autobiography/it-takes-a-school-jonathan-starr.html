  <title>It Takes a School - Jonathan Starr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A story of David and Goliath proportions, how an American hedge fund manager created a unique school in Somaliland whose students, against all odds, have come to achieve success beyond anyone&#39;s wildest dreams&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Starr, once a cutthroat hedge fund manager, is not your traditional do-gooder, and in 2009, when he decided to found Abaarso, a secondary school in Somaliland, the choice seemed crazy to even his closest friends. &quot;Why,&quot; they wondered, &quot;would he turn down a life of relative luxury to relocate to an armed compound in a breakaway region of the world&#39;s #1 failed state?&quot; To achieve his mission, Starr would have to overcome profound cultural differences, broken promises, and threats to his safety and that of his staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;It Takes a School&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how an abstract vision became a transformative reality, as Starr set out to build a school in a place forgotten by the world. It is the story of a skeptical and clan-based society learning to give way to trust. And it&#39;s the story of the students themselves, including a boy from a family of nomads who took off on his own in search of an education and a girl who waged a hunger strike in order to convince her strict parents to send her to Abaarso.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abaarso has placed forty graduates and counting in American universities, from Harvard to MIT, and sends Somaliland a clear message: its children can compete with anyone in the world. Now the initial question Starr was asked demands another: &quot;If such a success can happen in an unrecognized breakaway region of Somalia, can it not happen anywhere?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
