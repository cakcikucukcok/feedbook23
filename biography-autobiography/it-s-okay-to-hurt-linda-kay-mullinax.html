  <title>It’S Okay to Hurt - Linda Kay Mullinax</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There comes a time in ones life that nothing seems to make sense. My life is normal in every way. Then out of the blue my life is turned upside down.  I&#39;ve read a lot of books on romance, mystery and horror. A lot of them got me so involved I just didn&#39;t want to put it down. I never would have dreamed that my life would turn into a nightmare that I could not wake up from.  I&#39;ve read of horrible true life stories happening to other people but it never entered my mind that I would be living my own true horror story. 
Being in a car wreck is a horror story that no one wants to go through.  When you talk of being in a car wreck the first thing that comes to your mind is pain, being out of work and of course the settlement. I didn&#39;t think of all the tests and therapy I would have to go through. I believe I can say that most people think of getting better and going back to work pain free.
This was not the case for me. I had a pain that started in 1992 and has gone on for 19 years with no let up in sight. Please, read my story because you may be going through this same pain but you have never been able to put a name to it. You haven&#39;t been able to get any straight answers for these symptoms. I have and it is called Fibromyalgia.
Let me know if this is okay? Linda" />
