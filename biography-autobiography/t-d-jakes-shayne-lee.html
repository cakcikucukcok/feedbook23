  <title>T.D. Jakes - Shayne Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;T.D. Jakes has emerged as one of the most prolific spiritual leaders of our time. He is pastor of one of the largest churches in the country, CEO of a multimillion dollar empire, the host of a television program, author of a dozen bestsellers, and the producer of two Grammy Award-nominated CDs and three critically acclaimed plays. In 2001 &lt;I&gt;Time&lt;/I&gt; magazine featured Jakes on the cover and asked: Is Jakes the next Billy Graham&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;T.D. Jakes&lt;/B&gt; draws on extensive research, including interviews with numerous friends and colleagues of Jakes, to examine both Jakes&amp;#8217;s rise to prominence and proliferation of a faith industry bent on producing spiritual commodities for mass consumption. Lee frames Jakes and his success as a metaphor for changes in the Black Church and American Protestantism more broadly, looking at the ramifications of his rise&amp;#8212;and the rise of similar preachers&amp;#8212;for the way in which religion is practiced in this country, how social issues are confronted or ignored, and what is distinctly &amp;#8220;American&amp;#8221; about Jakes&#39;s emergence. While offering elements of biography, the work also seeks to shed light on important aspects of the contemporary American and African American religious experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee contends that Jakes&amp;#8217;s widespread success symbolizes a religious realignment in which mainline churches nationwide are in decline, while innovative churches are experiencing phenomenal growth. He emphasizes the &amp;#8220;American-ness&amp;#8221; of Jakes&amp;#8217;s story and reveals how preachers like Jakes are drawing followers by delivering therapeutic and transformative messages and providing spiritual commodities that are more in tune with postmodern sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the first work to critically examine Bishop Jakes&amp;#8217;s life and message, &lt;B&gt;T.D. Jakes&lt;/B&gt; is an important contribution to contemporary American religion as well as popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;" />
