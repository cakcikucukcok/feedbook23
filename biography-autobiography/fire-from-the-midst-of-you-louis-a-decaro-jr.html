  <title>&quot;Fire From the Midst of You&quot; - Louis A Decaro, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Brown is usually remembered as a terrorist whose unbridled hatred of slavery drove him to the ill-fated raid on Harper&#39;s Ferry, Virginia, in 1859. Tried and executed for seizing the arsenal and attempting to spur a liberation movement among the slaves, Brown was the ultimate &lt;I&gt;cause celebre&lt;/I&gt; for a country on the brink of civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#8220;Fire from the Midst of You&amp;#8221;&lt;/B&gt; situates Brown within the religious and social context of a nation steeped in racism, showing his roots in Puritan abolitionism.  DeCaro explores Brown&#39;s unusual family heritage as well as his business and personal losses, retracing his path to the Southern gallows. In contrast to the popular image of Brown as a violent fanatic, DeCaro contextualizes Brown&#39;s actions, emphasizing the intensely religious nature of the antebellum U.S. in which he lived.  He articulates the nature of Brown&#39;s radical faith and shows that, when viewed in the context of his times, he was not the religious fanatic that many have understood him to be.  DeCaro calls Brown a &amp;#8220;Protestant saint&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;an imperfect believer seeking to realize his own perceived calling in divine providence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with the post-millennial theology of his day, Brown understood God as working through mankind and the church to renew and revive sinful humanity. He read the Bible not only as God&#39;s word, but as &lt;I&gt;God&#39;s word to John Brown&lt;/I&gt;. DeCaro traces Brown&#39;s life and development to show how by forging faith as a radical weapon, Brown forced the entire nation to a point of crisis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#8220;Fire from the Midst of You&amp;#8221;&lt;/B&gt; defies the standard narrative with a new reading of John Brown.
