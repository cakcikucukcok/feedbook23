  <title>Full Moon Stages: Personal notes from 50 years of The Living Theatre - Judith Malina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;As cofounder of the internationally-known, highly-controversial radical political troupe, The Living Theater, author Judith Malina is one of the leading female countercultural figures of the 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond. in &lt;B&gt;FULL MOON STAGES: PERSONAL NOTES FROM 50 YEARS OF THE LIVING THEATRE&lt;/B&gt;, she creates an intimate memoir in a unique format with a collection of personal notes written on every full moon for 50 years from 1964 to 2014. These never-before-published entries reveal Malina&#39;s most private thoughts and inform the reader on what The Living Theatre was performing as they wound their way from New York City to Italy, France, Belgium, Germany and Brazil in a nomadic series of notable performances of such underground classics as &lt;I&gt;The Brig&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;The Connection&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;Paradise Now&lt;/I&gt;. Malina is relentless in her commitment to the full moon schedule, writing regardless of her current life circumstance. Notes issue forth from hotels, trains&amp;#151;even prison, offering a light on the consequences of holding true to her code of the theatrical expression of her pacifist-anarchist principles. The book&#39;s format is well-suited for modern readers interested in history of the counterculture. In addition, the book includes 30+ rare historical photos from Living Theatre archives.&lt;/div&gt;" />
