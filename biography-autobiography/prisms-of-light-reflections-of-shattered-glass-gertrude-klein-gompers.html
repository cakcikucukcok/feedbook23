  <title>Prisms of Light...Reflections of Shattered Glass - Gertrude Klein Gompers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The young Klein family, living a good but unremarkable life in Vienna, is thrust into the
realization that a political hate machine threatens their existence. &lt;p&gt;
The Nazi regime issues an edict that all Jews must leave Austria no later than November 9,
1938, and declares that those remaining will be taken to centers for redistribution. It is beyond
all human comprehension that these concentration centers will be death camps to millions
upon millions of people. &lt;p&gt;
How can this be real? This is their home, their country  how can they take the threat seriously
enough to RUN FOR THEIR LIVES? &lt;p&gt;
The world locks its doors, shutting out the Jews. &lt;p&gt;
Sigmund and Annie Klein and their two small children are among the desperate hordes begging
for survival. &lt;p&gt;
This is the true story of what happened to them: how they overcame the heartaches and
hardships they endured. It is a story of the human spirit. &lt;p&gt;
The author relates her impressions of these darkest of times, witnessed and experienced by herfirst
as a young child, then as a girl growing into womanhood, and finally in retrospect. &lt;p&gt;
The author states, This forced flight affected each one of us for the rest of our lives. Looking
back I believe this was the path we were meant to follow. &lt;p&gt;
PRISMS OF LIGHT ...&lt;i&gt;Reflections of Shattered Glass&lt;/i&gt; is an uplifting study of survival." />
