  <title>Angela Merkel - Matthew Qvortrup</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Angela Merkel, the woman who has held control of the  European Union and successfully negotiated with Russian  President Vladimir Putin, is one of the most crucial and formidable  fixtures in contemporary politics. Political commentator  and journalist Matthew Qvortrup weaves the personal  story of the German chancellor with the vivid history of post-  World War II in Angela Merkel, the riveting account of the  political titan&#39;s ascent from obscurity to become one of the  most influential leaders in the world, responsible for making  Germany more liberal and prosperous than it has ever been.  Updated from the hardcover, this definitive biography  follows Angela Merkel from her bleak childhood in East  Germany through her meteoric rise to power, and includes  up-to-date information on recent pressing concerns, such  as the current refugee crisis. Offering an unprecedented  look at how Merkel&#39;s inimitable personality and perspective  allowed her and her staff of mostly female advisors to  repeatedly outmaneuver a network of conservative male  politicians, Angela Merkel is essential reading for anyone  interested in politics and current affairs, or simply in the  story of a truly remarkable woman.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
