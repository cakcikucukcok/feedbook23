  <title>America&#39;s Daughter - Maria Nhambu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;America&amp;rsquo;s Daughter,&lt;/em&gt; the second book of the trilogy, the author arrives in the United States in the company of Catherine Murray, an American high-school teacher. Her adjustment to a new culture includes shocking doses of American-style racial discrimination and Nhambu&amp;rsquo;s discovery that she must learn to be a Black American. She graduates from college, thus fulfilling her dream of becoming a teacher, and teaches high school in the inner city. She marries, has two children, and establishes herself in the American way of life. Then a visit to Africa, and especially to Tanzania, reawakens the drumbeats and dancing that she carries in her soul. On her return home, she teaches Swahili and African Studies, performs African dance at schools, and creates &lt;em&gt;Aerobics With Soul&amp;reg;,&lt;/em&gt; a fitness workout based on African dance. She both finds and creates the family she longed for as a child and connects with her unknown background. The first book of the trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Africa&amp;rsquo;s Child, &lt;/em&gt;was released in 2016. The final book of her&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;memoir series&amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Drum Beats, Heart Beats&amp;mdash;&lt;/em&gt;reveals more of Nhambu&amp;rsquo;s life as she searches for her father.&lt;/p&gt;" />
