  <title>Emily Davies: Collected Letters, 1861-1875 - Ann B. Murphy, Deirdre Raftery, Jerome J. McGann, Herbert F. Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sarah Emily Davies (1830-1921) lived and crusaded during a time of profound change     for education and women&#39;s rights in England. At the time of her birth, women&#39;s     suffrage was scarcely open to discussion, and not one of England&#39;s universities (there     were four) admitted women. By the time of her death, not only had the number of universities     grown to twelve, all of which were open to women; women had also begun to get the vote.     Davies&#39;s own activism in the women&#39;s movement and in the social and educational     reform movements of the time culminated in her founding of Girton College, Cambridge University,     the first residential college of higher education for women. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the     social change that Davies witnessed-and helped to effect-was discussed, encouraged, and elicited     through her personal correspondence. These letters, written to friends, allies, and potential     supporters during the years of Davies&#39;s greatest political and social activity, reveal the     evolution of her skill and sophistication as an activist. They also show the development of     women&#39;s suffrage, education, and journalism movements from a group of loosely affiliated     like-minded friends to an astute and organized political network of reformers. In these     letters-most of which have never been published-we see Davies struggle to understand and     theorize about the role of women, cajole and encourage potential supporters, explore     complexities of various reform movements, and demonstrate her formidable attention to detail in     inventing and constructing an imaginable new institution. Her intensely engaged life placed     Davies at the very heart of the events that transformed her era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ann B. Murphy     is Associate Professor of English at Assumption College. Deirdre Raftery, Lecturer in Education     at University College Dublin, is the author of Emily Davies:Women and Learning in English     Writing, 1600-1900.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victorian Literature and Culture Series&lt;/p&gt;" />
