  <title>The Three Graces of Val-Kill - Emily Herring Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Three Graces of Val-Kill&lt;/i&gt; changes the way we think about Eleanor Roosevelt. Wilson examines what she calls the most formative period in Roosevelt&#39;s life, from 1922 to 1936, when she cultivated an intimate friendship with Marion Dickerman and Nancy Cook, who helped her build a cottage on the Val-Kill Creek in Hyde Park on the Roosevelt family land. In the early years, the three women--the &quot;three graces,&quot; as Franklin Delano Roosevelt called them--were nearly inseparable and forged a female-centered community for each other, for family, and for New York&#39;s progressive women. Examining this network of close female friends gives readers a more comprehensive picture of the Roosevelts and Eleanor&#39;s burgeoning independence in the years that marked Franklin&#39;s rise to power in politics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Wilson takes care to show all the nuances and complexities of the women&#39;s relationship, which blended the political with the personal. Val-Kill was not only home to Eleanor Roosevelt but also a crucial part of how she became one of the most admired American political figures of the twentieth century. In Wilson&#39;s telling, she emerges out of the shadows of monumental histories and documentaries as a woman in search of herself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
