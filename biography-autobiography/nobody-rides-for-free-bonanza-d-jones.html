  <title>Nobody Rides for Free - Bonanza D. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the late 1970s through the mid-1980s, I was an American
hitchhiker. I hitched across the entire United States and back twice.
Once I made it from Portland, Oregon, to Baltimore, Maryland, in
four and a half days. On another trip, I hitched from Birmingham,
Alabama, to Baltimore in twenty hours. I hitched down the East Coast
and up the West Coast. I rode across Nebraska in the back of a pickup
truck with a driver who wouldnt stop for anything and spent the night
in a school bus in Bodega Bay, California. I endured a continuous
stream of homosexual advances from drivers in the Bay Area and
was terrified by a pack of wild dogs while squatting on Crow Indian
land. I hopped a freight train in Portland, Oregon, and spent the night
under the famous Space Needle in Seattle, Washington. I almost got
busted in Montana for smoking pot out of an empty beer can and
was hassled by cops in New Orleans and Texas. I narrowly escaped
injury at the hands of commercial fishermen in Boston, who caught me
sleeping in their boat, and had the bejesus scared out of me by a
sixty-five-year-old Massachusetts woman who used her 1963 Rambler
as an offensive weapon. I met a bunch of gay guys, truck drivers,
stoners, petty thieves, ex-cons, heavily armed rednecks, and some very nice people too. I was a lot younger then, but I wouldnt trade those
experiences for the world.
You hardly ever see hitchhikers anymore, but a few years ago, we
were everywhere. But before I launch into my story, a brief history
lesson is in order." />
