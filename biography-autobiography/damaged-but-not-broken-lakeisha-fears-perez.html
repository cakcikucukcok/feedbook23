      <meta name="description" content="Damaged, But Not Broken 
A Memoir by LaKeisha Fears-Perez
Damaged But Not Broken is a collection of memoirs as told by young people who are heartbroken and who have failed or in some way been affected by negativity. Their recollections are of abandonment, abuse, addictions, and neglect. Their stories prove that the effects of tolerance and how we hold fast to what we see and what we are exposed to varies from individual to individual. The theory of what is perceived early in childhood before the age of five is rooted and embedded in a childs psyche.
We set our children up for failure when we subject them to unstable conditions. The environment and what we expose our children to affects how they view themselves and the world around them. A well-rounded balance is essential in a childs life and until they are introduced to religious training, they tend to see us as their god from the moment of birth. Whatever we expose them to is indelibly written in their brains. Children are like little sponges soaking up everything until they come to the age of reasoning at which they begin to understand right from wrong.
Unacceptable lifestyles are damaging,an accident waiting to happen for children as well as adults. The emphasis is not so much on where we are in  life as it is on what we are doing where we are. What we are doing to our children can cause them to struggle with the worries of this world and not be able to adapt very well. 
Getting it out of ones system has proven to be liberating, and the number of broken adults who pass hurt onto their children and continue the ongoing destructive dysfunctional cycle is unfortunate.  The stories you are about to read are therapeutic. They are a way to get it out for some and just simple acknowledgement for others." />
