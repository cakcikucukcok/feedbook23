  <title>No One Could Know - Kristan Shan Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, &lt;em&gt;No One Could Know&lt;/em&gt; is actually a funny bookat least in the beginning. Many have said, I laughed, I cried, I got mad, and I even learned a little as I read your book. So, why is a book about abortion partially funny? I think thats just how life is sometimesits full of ups and downs, isnt it?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Reasons for abortion vary, but I dare say a large number of abortions take place because of the very same reason I had mineso no one would know what was done at an inconvenient time. Im now going public with my experience of an abortionand later, rapebecause I believe there is someone out there who needs to read this and will be touched by what it contains. If you have never found yourself in such situations as I did, then maybe this book can help you to be of help to someone else.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No One Could Know&lt;/em&gt; is engaging, thought-provoking, and informative. More importantly, its a tool of recovery for those who walked the same road I did. When I chose abortion, I was a Christian, but I had no idea how astounding and full of grace, forgiveness, and love our awesome God is. Jesus Christ has truly set me free. I hope you experience His presence of joy unspeakable and full of glory as you relax and slip into my story with me, God, and a good cup of coffee.&lt;/p&gt;" />
