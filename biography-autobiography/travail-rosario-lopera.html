  <title>Travail - Rosario Lopera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many people who have met Rosario wonder why and how she came to the USA. Others heard many lies and bad things about her. She has kept quiet until years ago. She decided to write her book and tell everybody who she is.
It was not easy to write, and it has taken me so long to finish. Im not a writer, but I want to keep
my book  the way I write.  I lost my loved one, my fianc, while waiting in Florida to marry him. A month went by. When I didnt hear from him, I thought that he changed his mind about our wedding, but I was wrong.
He was a private pilot who had a tragic airplane accident while I was in Florida with a Spanish family.
Why was I in Florida?  Because I was coming back from London where I did represent my country Bolivia in the Miss World 1963 contest.
My mother told me that she didnt want to tell me because she didnt know how I was going to react.
Well, read this book, and you will see how I reacted. It hasnt been easy to write this book because it has too many painful memories, but people dont know about it, and I get some nasty things sometimes because people dont know me. I hope this will help to understand me a little better. Thank God that because I was Miss Bolivia, the doors where open here and there, so I got my green card on my way to London.
I was glad to have a green card and come to the USA and be able to work as a secretary typist the third day I was here, and also I was lucky to know people from my country where to arrive to." />
