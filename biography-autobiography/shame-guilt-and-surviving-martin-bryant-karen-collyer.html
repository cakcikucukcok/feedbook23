  <title>SHAME, GUILT,  AND SURVIVING  MARTIN BRYANT - Karen Collyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Martin Bryant will always be connected to a great deal of misery, torment and death. But it didn&amp;rsquo;t start on April 28, 1996, the day he murdered thirty-five people in what became known as the Port Arthur Massacre, in Tasmania, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book isn&amp;rsquo;t just about Martin Bryant. It is one woman&amp;rsquo;s story of how child abuse, trauma and dysfunctional parents made her the perfect candidate for Martin Bryant&amp;rsquo;s unwanted attention, long before the massacre of 1996. Just how did the devastating childhood traumas affect this woman&amp;rsquo;s ability to demand help, to speak, to yell as loudly as she could until something was done to stop his violent stalking of her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could the massacre have been averted had the laws around stalking supported, rather than limited, police response to her cries for help?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What was Martin Bryant like before the massacre?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow the journey of one of Martin Bryant&amp;rsquo;s invisible victims, as she does her best to describe life before, during and after Martin Bryant entered her life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
