  <title>The Movie Queen Quiz Book - Ed Karvoski Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you know&lt;p&gt;&lt;il&gt;
Which movie queens were the first mother and daughter to each receive an Oscar nomination in the same year?
Which movie queens appeared in advertisements for products ranging from Coppertone tanning lotion to Depends undergarments?
Which movie queen (and show-biz legend) delivered the following line of dialogue, and in what film? There are only two things I dislike about you. Your face!
&lt;p&gt;
The answers to these and hundreds of other fun questions are revealed in &lt;i&gt;The Movie Queen Quiz Book: A Trivia Test Dedicated to Fabulous Female Film Stars&lt;/i&gt;. This is the ultimate challenge for fans of the grande dames of the big screen:&lt;p&gt;
Classic Movie QueensBette Davis, Joan Crawford and Katharine Hepburn!
Contemporary Movie QueensJulia Roberts, Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon!
Award-Winning Movie QueensElizabeth Taylor, Meryl Streep and Judi Dench!
Funny Movie QueensWhoopi Goldberg, Lucille Ball and Mae West!
Musical Movie QueensBarbra Streisand, Bette Midler and Judy Garland!
And many more fabulous female film stars, past and present!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As far as trivia books go, Ed Karvoski Jr. always has the best, and &#39;The Movie Queen Quiz Book&#39; is no exception.  The questions are provocative and funny, and even those of us who know all about Liz Taylor, Katharine Hepburn and Barbra are bound to be stumped by some of the zingers he throws at you... Your stomach will be sore from the laughter and the fun he brings to the oldest game of all -- the trivia quiz.  It&#39;s fabulous indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Kevin Killian, San-Francisco-based novelist, critic &amp; playwright, and &quot;Top 100 Reviewer&quot; on amazon.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you&#39;re a fan of trivia, the movies or movie queens, this is the book for you.  There are 600 multiple-choice questions that range from &#39;who said what&#39; to &#39;what was their name before becoming a star&#39; to &#39;sexy scenes,&#39; plus a whole lot more... Get this book and take the test.  It will be a fun conversation starter at your local watering hole or great to use as a party game.  With this many questions you could modify your Trivial Pursuit game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Mountman, Internet Jockey at Rainbow World Radio&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&#39;The Movie Queen Quiz Book&#39; is a compilation of silver screen queen facts, trivia and arcane tidbits that will challenge even the most ardent aficionado... Karvoski stretched the art of movie queen trivia beyond the silver screen personas of Marlene, Joan, Bette and Greta to include more modern-day divas and their screen appearances... Even for the hardened fanatic, there&#39;s truly much to be learned about your favorite screen queen... I encourage you to check out &#39;The Movie Queen Quiz Book.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;Philip Bender, OUT IN THE MOUNTAINS (Vermont) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;A worthy test for any movie lover!&lt;/p&gt;
