  <title>Budo and the Badge - Patrick  J.   Ciser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lt. Patrick J. Ciser (Ret.) of the City of Clifton Police Department, in New Jersey, is also known to his many karate students as Sensei (Teacher).  Ciser achieved national and international fame by representing the United States in five international karate tournaments, winning gold medals in South America and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pat Ciser, as he is known in North Jersey, grew up and became a police officer in Clifton in 1977.  Growing as a police officer, he started to realize that with his martial arts skills, he could save lives, surprisingly, on both sides of the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newspaper accounts of Cisers exploits over the years bear witness to the true stories recounted in this book.  Headlines and quotes give a glimpse of his illustrious career as he was continually called upon, in life and death situations.  The Clifton Journal read, Pat Ciser, Cliftons answer to Superman  New Jerseys Record wrote, Veteran officer compared to Chuck Norris;  while the Heard News read, Action hero calling it quits, when announcing his retirement in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Ciser as he recalls mastering karate, kicking in doors, and dodging bullets and blades.  The only difference between the stories in Budo and the Badge, and the ones on the big screen, are that these stories are real. &lt;/p&gt;" />
