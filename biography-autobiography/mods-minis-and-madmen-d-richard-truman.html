  <title>Mods, Minis, and Madmen - D. Richard Truman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A nostalgic romp through the sixties that changed everyones lives forever, &lt;i&gt;Mods, Minis, and Madmen&lt;/i&gt; presents a story of remarkable achievement during the twentieth centurys most significant cultural reboot. It celebrates a wondrous age drugged by the can-do attitude of youth.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Revolutionary London was the birthplace of the boutique, and Mary Quant introduced the mini-skirtnamed after a car. John Stephen introduced heart-racing male boutiques on Kings Road that soon carved out a global niche. Lesley Hornby also known as Twiggy, the Cockney dolly birdstrutted her popsicle legs while touting mini-fashions. East Londoner Vidal Sassoon gave new life to tousled hair with a look that is still with us today.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;And of course, British sounds, led by the Beatles, hammered the charts in every country able to tune in. The lyrics spoke to us and seemed to sympathize with our turmoil, revealing an honest understanding of life as it would be, up to the age of sixty-four. It was a booster shot that pumped up everyone living in the sixties, and their tales would be told decades later.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mods, Minis, and Madmen&lt;/i&gt; is the tale of a writer and his disciples from the New World arriving in the old, just as the explosion was about to take place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
