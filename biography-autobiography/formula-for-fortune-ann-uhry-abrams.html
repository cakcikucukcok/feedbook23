  <title>Formula for Fortune - Ann Uhry Abrams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Asa Candler rose from a rural background to reap a fortune. His windfall came from purchasing the Coca-Cola formula in 1888 and establishing the company that became a national phenomenon in less than a decade. In &lt;i&gt;Formula for Fortune&lt;/i&gt;, author &lt;b&gt;Ann Uhry Abrams&lt;/b&gt; narrates the life and times of Candlerfrom his ancestral background to the death of the last of his five children.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Formula for Fortune&lt;/i&gt; not only shows how he turned his entrepreneurial genius into an empire, but also relates his status in Atlanta, Georgia, as a prominent banker, realtor, philanthropist, civil servant, and mayor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Painting a lively portrait of the past, this biography tells a fascinating American story that covers a century of American and Southern life as seen through the eyes of a middle-class family elevated to prominence by their patriarchs incredible success. It not only provides a peek into the horse-and-buggy days of one of the nations major corporations, but also follows Coca-Colas fascinating transformation from patent-medicine to international phenomenon. Family dynamics weave through this drama of love, disappointments, and disaster played out against the background of four wars, a race riot, technological revolutions, and numerous courtroom dramas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
