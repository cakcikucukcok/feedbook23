  <title>Derek Jeter - Patrick Giles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Derek Jeter-the Yankees shortstop who isn&#39;t short on talent, looks, or heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though he&#39;s only 24, many of his teammates describe Derek Jeter as a baseball player with maturity beyond his years. His awesome skills on the playing field have earned him an American League Rookie of the Year award and helped the Yankees to two World Series championships in three years. Jeter is rapidly making a name for himself as one of today&#39;s hottest young athletes. Baseball fans can&#39;t get enough of the graceful Yankees shortstop who wows them with his power and speed. Women are mesmerized by his hear-stopping good looks-he was even named on of &lt;i&gt;People &lt;/i&gt;magazine&#39;s 50 most beautiful people in the world! Read all about this down-to-earth superstar, from his childhood in Kalamazoo, Michigan, where his dream of playing for the Yankees began, to his life today, his charity work, his hopes for the future, and why he told GQ magazine, &quot;I have the greatest job in the world.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With eight pages of cool photos!&lt;/p&gt;" />
