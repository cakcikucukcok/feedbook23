  <title>Stuck in Reverse - Irene Bradford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a very true story, and Irene talks candidly about her early years.  She talks freely of the many hard knock backs she endured,  so it makes immensely  fascinating reading.
Despite going into Oldham on occasions for a sack of coke, at 12, she never, ever, considered herself a deprived child. She writes about all the hardships, and struggles her mother had, bringing up a family of 10 children. And describes vividly how she had to jump naked out of a 25 foot high bedroom window, when she was confronted with three masked men in her bedroom, losing her business due to this fall.
Then years later tells how having once more built up a very profitable business,it closed down. Explaining the risks she took getting to that stage, and why when  at its peak, and in paid for and fully tenanted premises, she lost everything again. 
Then she tells the whole  truth about the arson attack on the one million pound canal side business premises, the suspect, and the missing keys, and why it has been left in a ruinous condition since 2005. The sly, devious, scheming tricks, that have been played on her by the council while trying very hard, but without success, to grab her precious site. And the latter end of the book is a series of correspondence from the council.  There is no doubt at all this book will certainly shock, and stir up a real hornets nest, but it just had to be written." />
