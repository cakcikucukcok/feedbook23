  <title>A New Beautiful: Overcoming Life’S Obstacles - Jennifer Pullara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you ever think about the power you gain by overcoming your challenges? Do you give yourself enough credit for the obstacles you face and overcome with grace and beauty? How do your life and your identity change after you have come face-to-face with difficulties?
_______________________________________
Imagine a caterpillar. It is in a larval stage of what may be a butterfly. It may not be aware that the next chapter of its life will be filled with challenge and struggle, but as it grows, it slowly gains a new identity. Through determination and hard work, the caterpillar becomes the butterfly, never realizing that by conquering lifes obstacles, it was changed forever and had become a new beautiful.
This book, A New Beautiful, is a brilliant collection of stories from seventeen women. Each story is written with voice, capturing the essence of each womans depiction of her challenging story. Some stories in this collection are written with humor, others with tears, but all are written from the heart. 
Readers will be engaged and inspired throughout each story as they connect the chapters to themselves or perhaps to someone they know. No one goes through life alone." />
