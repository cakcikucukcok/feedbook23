  <title>One Man’S Time - Hermann Strasser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hermann Strasser&lt;/b&gt;born in Germany in 1919was determined to live from the start, bearing a stubborn streak that would serve him well his entire life. He survived the attempt of his mother to abort him and then moved from foster home to foster home until he was four, when he found the family who would raise him to adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, divided into three sections, Strasser recalls the story of his life, beginning with his birth, childhood, and youth in the period between the two wars. He then narrates his experiences in the military during World War II, serving in the German army, including tales from the frontlines and of being badly wounded. Finally, he shares tales of his postwar life, starting from nothing, working hard to build a career in the textile industry, and eventually purchasing and establishing his own knitted goods factory. He built his business for several decadesonly to see it fall about in the hands of his son. Even so, his stubborn nature supported him, and he and his wife established a new life together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One Mans Time&lt;/i&gt; shares the life story and personal experiences of a man who faced many trials and came out the stronger for these difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;" />
