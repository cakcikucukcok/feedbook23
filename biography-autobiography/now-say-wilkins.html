  <title>Now - Say Wilkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is my real life story, the true testimony of my relationship with Jesus Christ, I didnt choose Him, but He choose me. &lt;br&gt;
The reason for me to write this book is to share the good news about JESUS and my amazing life experience . &lt;br&gt;
  Jesus is the Truth, the Way, and the Life, He is the healing TREE for the world.
I am not talking about religion, but have relationship with Him, in Him I found hope, I found peace, and I found joy. He raised me from my death, I born again with Him, I am now a little child who is living life depending on HIM. &lt;br&gt;
I had passed through all the dark valley of death, the trials and tribulations which He had predicted for us in the bible, they had built me stronger, and made me a better person. 
I hope and pray with this book the way will come and find you, the light from Jesus will shine and make a different to many, whatever come your way dont give up. &lt;br&gt;
Jesus is within us, He is my secret code, my ID badge, my password to log in, and to escape from my darkness night. &lt;br&gt;
 Jesus helped me simplify my life, He makes my day shorter by letting me go through and giving me the great joy.. Jesus Christ and His bible are real and alive. &lt;br&gt;
Heaven and hell are real place too," />
