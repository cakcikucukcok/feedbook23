  <title>Reclaimed - Ray Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I kept reading until the end. It was life affirming, exciting, hot, and new. It has everything so many people would love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zach Book, Producer, Director, Actor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray Cook has an innate ability to tell his story with a wonderful artistry that keeps the reader connected, engaged, and fascinated in the revealing chapters of his colorful journey  and the lessons he has learned ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Brad Lemack, Author, Professor, Talent Manager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone should be so luckyan idyllic upbringing in bucolic Idaho, a loving family, a close-knit community  but what if your authentic self challenges life as you know it and your place in it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stay as a pariah and risk exile or to flee as a refugee without identity  that is the question. Reclaimed is a quest of personal reconciliation of a double life, a blend of dichotomous mishaps and redemptive insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resist the folly of conformity, empower yourself, dare to be you! Reclaimed offers hope that life is manageable and happiness is a choice!&lt;/p&gt;" />
