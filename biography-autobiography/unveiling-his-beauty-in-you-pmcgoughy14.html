  <title>Unveiling His Beauty in You - Pmcgoughy14</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pamela McGoughy was born in Jackson, Tennessee, in October 1956. At the age of three, she moved to Beech Bluff, Tennessee, with her parents and siblings. She grew up on her parents and paternal grandparents farm.
Pam was always a dependable, loyal, and honest helper with home chores and do-it-yourself small home projects. Pam says she was blessed to have had both her parents and paternal and maternal grandparents as she was growing up. 
Pam became a caregiver in 1993 after the death of her father. Pam is presently a continuous caregiver, as she views her work as a needed ministry with all ages of people and their circumstances.
Pam attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh online and is applying the skills that she learned toward residential home-organizing services when she is not working as a caregiver. Pam is most amiable as she appreciates each person that God allows in her life. In 2001, Pam relocated from Jackson, Tennessee, to Elgin, Illinois. Since then, she has met many wonderful people in Illinois. Pam enjoys each person that she has met as she knows that it is always a reason that people come into our lives. Pam began writing the book, Unveiling His Beauty in You in 2007. She would write in her daily journal about life and how she would cope with all her circumstances, as she would apply biblical scriptures to her situations. Pam says she wrote this book, Unveiling His Beauty in You, so that it may encourage, inspire, and motivate one to their next level of success as each journey continues. As you continue your journey, may success be yours." />
