  <title>I Am Someone Special - Belinda Hernandez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the book I Am Someone Special, the author shares the story of her dysfunctional childhoodher journey through the road of drug addiction and drug dealing and how she struggled to leave her dark past behind and move on to a new and better life.
Ms. Hernandez did not experience the kind of childhood others enjoy by being adopted into a wealthy, well-off family. She failed to receive the affection she wanted from her parents, particularly from her adoptive mother.
The author was the youngest among seven children and the one who received the worst treatment from her alcoholic mother, who was also addicted to drugs. Her birthmother had stabbed her in the head when she was a nine-month-old baby.
After an incident that almost robbed the author of her life, she was placed into an orphanage, where her adoptive parents rescued her. 
The authors adoptive family gave her the love she had long wanted, along with everything she and her adopted brother and sister could ask for. 
But despite it all, Ms. Hernandez became rebellious, especially as a teenager. Her rebellious teenage years eventually led her to the wrong path as she started using drugs and selling it as well. 
She worked further into the drug business until she got caught and sentenced for a couple years in prison. After serving her sentence, the author strived to live a clean life and start anew. 
With the help of her faith in God and the support of the man she loves, she managed to reinvent herself into a better and strong person. 
I Am Someone Special might appeal to a reader interested in stories that have changed the lives of individuals who recovered from drug addiction and made the decision to rebuild their lives away from drugs.
