  <title>Stand    Corrected - Diane Deal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story started out as a reminder of the hike my family and I had shared.  From the first night out away from all the noise of the day to day life to the hour to hour frustration of the insects who invaded our lives.  Between the beauty of the waterfalls and our ability to share the lives of the creatures who resided there, to the situations each of us were placed in for example mud holes and roots that covered the ground in every size and shape, I believe the entire family was able to find a peace and closeness that had been missing for a while. I hope that everyone that reads this book will find out what I have.  There is nothing like spending a few days out in the wilderness with the ability to find solace and an understanding of just how important it is to appreciate the beauty that surrounds us every day within every inch of nature contained within our borders. Along with that fact please take the time to show your family just how important they are.  This was the main reason I decided to go on this hike. Good or bad it was one of the best vacations I had ever taken. I hope each person enjoys reading this story as much as I did actually partaking in it.  Enjoy" />
