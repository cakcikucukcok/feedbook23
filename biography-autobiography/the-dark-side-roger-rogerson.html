  <title>The Dark Side - Roger Rogerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The most controversial cop in Australian history, in his own words.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Roger Rogerson hasn&#39;t been a police officer for more than 20 years. Yet his name makes him, the most well-known &#39;detective-sergeant&#39; in Australia.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;He has been the subject of articles, appearances, profiles and books; portrayed in TV dramas; and recorded by covert listening devices at home for months.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Rogerson took up his own pen in prison. Out, he walked the club and pub speaking circuit, where he found a ready audience for his tales of law and mayhem. He now writes for newspapers.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Here, he tells us of:&lt;br /&gt;- high profile investigations;&lt;br /&gt;- forgotten ones, like when a key from Tassie opened a Sydney murderer&#39;s door;&lt;br /&gt;- some of the most interesting dead people he&#39;s ever met;&lt;br /&gt;- the hunt for desperados on a deadly robbing spree;&lt;br /&gt;- the bloody night that earned him the award for courageous action;&lt;br /&gt;- meeting a prominent toe cutter;&lt;br /&gt;- besieging the comic Wally and the dangerous Green Man;&lt;br /&gt;- the dogs in a prison he sojourned in;&lt;br /&gt;- bad days in a flattened railcarriage at Granville...&lt;br /&gt;and more...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;These untold tales are the ones everyone else has glossed over or ignored, from the horse&#39;s mouth, for the first time." />
