  <title>Pieces of Dreams - William Ebot Makia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pieces of Dreams is an exposition of the conscience of Cameroon. In this memoir, Makia discusses his ascension from a very low status in Betock, a small village in Cameroon, to the rank of Principal Civil Administrator Special Classthe 
highest grade in the Cameroon civil service. His journey, punctuated by impediments, takes him from walking four miles every school day to the nearest elementary school in another village to studying in the Loughborough Cooperative College, England. 
	Dreams are a powerful subject in Makias autobiography, and the book emphasizes the authors deep spiritual connection with God and with his family. His constant communication with his late parents, especially his mother, through dreams becomes an awakening to him and a validation that the dead are, in fact, not far removed from the living; the dead have merely transitioned into another realm and can speak to the living at will through the pipeline of dreams." />
