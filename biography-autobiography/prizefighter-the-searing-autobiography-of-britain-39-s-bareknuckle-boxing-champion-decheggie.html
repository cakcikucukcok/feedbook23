  <title>Prizefighter - The Searing Autobiography of Britain&#39;s Bareknuckle Boxing Champion - DecHeggie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&#39;You can get a couple of years for beating the shit out of another bloke, or a couple of grand. I chose to do the latter&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decca&#39;s story is that of a bullied boy with an impossible dream. Of solvent abuse, violence, drug addiction, depression, boxing and bareknuckle fighting but - ultimately - redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It begins on a council estate in Carlisle where, as the victim, of cruel bullies, a young Decca anaesthetised himself from the pain and humiliation by sniffing solvents. In his mid-teens the fear fell away to be replaced by fury, as the bullies discovered to their cost. Memories of that frightened boy fuelled a rage that forged a fearsome street-fighter and future champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Working on the doors attracted more trouble but further enhanced his growing reputation. At the age of nineteen, life was good until the love of his life left him. Depression set in and prevailed. For almost ten years, he fell prey to a rampant cocaine habit, which provoked his demons, making him unpredictable and dangerous to be around. Serious jail time seemed inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of sheer desperation, his Dad arranged Decca&#39;s first unlicensed boxing match. He won and became instantly hooked. Having gotten fit, hungry, and off the drugs, he was lured into the bloody arena of bareknuckle fighting. Many brutal undefeated fights followed, as did two BKB heavyweight titles. A chance meeting with renowned boxing promoter Ricky English led to Decca&#39;s shot at the iconic &#39;Guv&#39;nor&#39; title. The rest, as they say, is history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
