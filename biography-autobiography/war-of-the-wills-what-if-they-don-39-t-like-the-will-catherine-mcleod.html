  <title>War of the Wills: What if they don&#39;t like the Will? - Catherine McLeod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Allen and I lived together for nineteen years. I helped Allen run his farms and maintain his investment properties. We enjoyed a happy life until Allen&amp;rsquo;s health began to fail and he was diagnosed with Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease. As his physical and mental states worsen, I took on the responsibility for running his farms, doing his bookkeeping and paying his bills by cheques that I filled in and he signed.&lt;br /&gt; As Allen&amp;rsquo;s health deteriorated he knew that he should make provision for me to live comfortably after he was gone. His daughter, Beryl and her husband Wayne Bilk were not happy but they decided to tolerate the situation because it relieved them from having to deal with Allen&amp;rsquo;s failing health and his care needs. However, as Allen&amp;rsquo;s mental state worsens and his assets increase in value considerably they begin plotting and haranguing the ill and increasingly frail Allen to leave everything to them. He is compelled to make will after will to appease them but the one constant in all of them is that he leaves an inheritance to me in love and appreciation for our life together and my devoted efforts to making his last years comfortable and happy.&lt;br /&gt; Desperate, the Bilks devise a plan to ensure they get what they want---a new will allegedly, made and signed by an almost comatose Allen three weeks before his death leaves me nothing. Upon his death, with so many wills in existence the estate is tied up in court for years. During this time, The Bilks want everything and for me to disappear I only want the house and farm that was promised to me by Allen and for Allen&amp;rsquo;s final wishes honoured.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
