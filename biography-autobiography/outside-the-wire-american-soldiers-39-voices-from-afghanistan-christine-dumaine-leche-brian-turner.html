  <title>Outside the Wire: American Soldiers&#39; Voices from Afghanistan - Christine Dumaine Leche, Brian Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A riveting collection of thirty-eight narratives by American soldiers     serving in Afghanistan, &lt;i&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/i&gt; offers a powerful evocation of     everyday life in a war zone. Christine Dumaine Leche-a writing instructor who left her home and     family to teach at Bagram Air Base and a forward operating base near the volatile     Afghan-Pakistani border-encouraged these deeply personal reflections, which demonstrate the     power of writing to battle the most traumatic of experiences.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The soldiers     whose words fill this book often met for class with Leche under extreme circumstances and in     challenging conditions, some having just returned from dangerous combat missions, others having     spent the day in firefights, endured hours in the bitter cold of an open guard tower, or     suffered a difficult phone conversation with a spouse back home. Some choose to record momentous     events from childhood or civilian life-events that motivated them to join the military or that     haunt them as adults. Others capture the immediacy of the battlefield and the emotional and     psychological explosions that followed. These soldiers write through the senses and from the     soul, grappling with the impact of moral complexity, fear, homesickness, boredom, and     despair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We each, writes Leche, require witnesses to the narratives of our     lives. &lt;i&gt;Outside the Wire&lt;/i&gt; creates that opportunity for us as readers to bear     witness to the men and women who carry the weight of war for us all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
