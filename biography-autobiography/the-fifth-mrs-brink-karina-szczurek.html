  <title>The Fifth Mrs Brink - Karina Szczurek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I wish I could have warmed him. He was ice-cold. I held his hand, his face; stroked his skin and hair; kissed his lips, three times, and his eyelids ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recognised him. He was still my beloved André... I knew him, and I recognised him. I sat next to him, alone, then with others, thinking of all the happy memories, ours only, and those with others. So much love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The love of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly impossible to write.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus opens Karina M. Szczurek&#39;s memoir of her life before, during and after her marriage to André P. Brink. Polish-born Karina was twenty-seven when she met the acclaimed writer, forty-two years her senior, and they spent a decade together. Here she chronicles their relationship, from their first encounter in Vienna, Austria, through the difficult early stages of moving across continents to be with one another, to finding calm and stability in their married life in Cape Town, and finally facing the challenges of André&#39;s deteriorating health in the last year of his life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Fifth Mrs Brink&lt;/i&gt; is also the story of two interwoven writing lives, Karina&#39;s burgeoning and André&#39;s in its final phase. It is a diary of creative dissolution and knitting back together, a homage to a marriage tragically cut short but also to a love to last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;" />
