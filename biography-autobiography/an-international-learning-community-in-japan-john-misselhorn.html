  <title>An International Learning Community in Japan - John Misselhorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For a time, I lived and worked in Japan in the beautiful city of Kitakyushu and taught English as a Foreign Language to the Japanese. &lt;i&gt;An International Learning Community in Japan&lt;/i&gt; is the story of my experiences in Japanese society and also a discussion of my theories and techniques of teaching English to Japanese people. So what makes this book different from the many other books by Westerners who have lived in Japan and written about their experiences or other books about teaching English in Japan? The entire work is unified under the central theme of an international, creative learning community that my students and I created together. It is a concept that describes the relationship that evolved between my students and me. This book will be of interest to anyone with a general appreciation of Japanese culture or who desires to learn about teaching in Japan. This book is not only about how Japanese and American cultures differ, but it also offers a unique vision of international communication and understanding. So this is a story of close international friendship. Journey to Japan with an American English teacher who discovers a beautiful, gentle culture, new educational ideas and his heart!" />
