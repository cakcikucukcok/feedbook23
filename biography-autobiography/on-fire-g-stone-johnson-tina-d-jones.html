  <title>On Fire - G. Stone Johnson, Tina D. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a suburb of Metro Detroit, a group of astounding men and women work. They gather in an organization known of by all and yet understood by very few. With their super-human efforts, many lives are saved and chaos is reined in. These are the true stories of the West Bloomfield Fire Department through the eyes of one man.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
G. Stone Johnson was part of that amazing community of ordinary people doing an&amp;nbsp; extraordinary&amp;nbsp; job. He is a veteran fire fighter and paramedic who put his life on the line almost every day for thirty years.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
With amazing detail and no punches pulled, he weaves this narrative in a spell-binding fashion. Action, destruction and chaos are elements he covers as part of his job. Joy and sorrow rub shoulders with pleasure and pain. A story of second chances and last chances. But most of all it reflects the life of a hero in our midst and of those brave men and women who serve us and fight the elemental forces of nature to protect who we are and what we hold dear.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal read for anyone considering a career in the emergency services, this amazing tale shows the transition of the fire service and the community it served from the late twentieth century into the new millenium. Enjoy the ride!&lt;/p&gt;" />
