  <title>And Live Rejoicing: Chapters from a Charmed Life &amp;mdash; Personal Encounters with Spiritual Mavericks, Remarkable Seekers, and the World&#39;s Great Relig - Huston Smith, Phil Cousineau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Huston Smith is in his 90s and has long been the preeminent voice of ecumenical and the study of the world&#39;s religions in the U.S.A. He has written a previous memoir about his childhood and early adulthood, Tales of Wonder. This new book goes back through his life and describes meetings and experiences around his study of religion. He shares encounters with some of the most prominent cultural and religious people of the 20th century, including: the Dalai Lama, Aldous Huxley, Joseph Campbell, Mickey Hart, Gerald Heard, Timothy Leary, Ram Dass. He traveled around the world, meeting Muslims, Buddhists, Confucians, Christians, Taoists, Shamans. He participated in ceremonies, including sweat lodges and drumming with the Grateful Dead. The book is part memoir and part teaching about the variety and impact of religion in the world." />
