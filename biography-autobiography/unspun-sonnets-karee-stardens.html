  <title>Unspun Sonnets - Karee Stardens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes doors slam against your will, certain doors may never open and other doors stay open until you choose to close them. My name is Karee Stardens and I have the lucky pleasure of reflecting these very recent events with you because it has been a painful blessing that needs to be shared. I would still be tugging at door handles that won&#39;t budge if it hadn&#39;t have been for a God who had compassion and gave me the truths that I was seeking. Now my bridges are truly burnt, and there is still much healing to be done, but never before have I ever been able to shake the dust from my feet. Now I can walk with a bounce in my step towards the bright future of real life.
As Jesus said: &quot;It is finished.&quot; John 19:30" />
