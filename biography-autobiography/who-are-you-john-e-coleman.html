  <title>Who Are You - John E. Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who Are You&lt;br /&gt;
Treasured Memories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wouldnt it be great if you could just push a button on your computer and have a list of all you memories pop up. &lt;br /&gt;
This ingenious book of lists, which is in essence a catalogue of all your memories, does just that. &lt;br /&gt;
Its not a diary. its not a journal. You dont write sentences or paragraphs. You simply make a list. And when you are finished, the book is truly you. Its your life in lists. It consists of your hopes, dreams, fantasies, best and worst times and funniest moments. It is everything you have wondered, like to remember, need to face, fear, desire, wish, and hope for. &lt;br /&gt;
We are all a conglomeration of our hopes and dreams, wishes and ears, accomplishments and failures - an amalgam of all the different: 1) experiences weve had, 2) ideas we thought, 3) feelings we felt, and 4) our physical bodies.&lt;br /&gt;
Outside of ones family and friends, the greatest things in a persons life are his memories. Its sad that people dont take time to enjoy our memories more often and learn from them and appreciate what we have. &lt;br /&gt;
Called by some a road map on knowing and loving yourself, it offers a path to self- understanding and happiness. &lt;br /&gt;
The best counseling tool, Ive ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;
The easiest way to recall your life&lt;br /&gt;
The book, when finished can be a priceless family heirloom, with everything you wanted to know about a loved one.&lt;br /&gt;
Treasured Memories is a fascinating voyage of self-discovery for all of you.&lt;br /&gt;
And I hope the memories in this book will help you remember and appreciate your Wonderful Life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;" />
