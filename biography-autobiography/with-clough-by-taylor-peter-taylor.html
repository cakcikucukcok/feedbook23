  <title>With Clough, By Taylor - Peter Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Brian Clough famously remarked. “I&#39;m not equipped to manage successfully without Peter Taylor. I am the shop window and he is the goods in the back.”&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally published in 1980, &lt;i&gt;With Clough, By Taylor&lt;/i&gt; is the definitive account of the relationship that revolutionised English football and the trade of the football manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outrageously successful and sometimes simply outrageous, Brian Clough and Peter Taylor took over two moribund clubs: Derby County and Nottingham Forest. They went on to win the Football League Championship with each of them, a managerial feat unequalled since before the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were the first to pay £1 million for a player; the first to win two European Cups and two League Cups in successive seasons; and to command such fierce loyalty that the entire Derby County team threatened to strike when they resigned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classic insider account shows how the two worked as a pair, complementing each other’s individual strengths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
