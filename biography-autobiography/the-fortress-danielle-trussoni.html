  <title>The Fortress - Danielle Trussoni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The critically acclaimed, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Falling Through the Earth&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Angelology &lt;/em&gt;returns with this much-anticipated memoir of love and transformation in France. &lt;em&gt;The Fortress&lt;/em&gt; is Peter Mayle meets &lt;em&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/em&gt;, a gorgeously written account of one woman&amp;#8217;s journey to the other side of the romantic fairytale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;If I had been another woman, I might have been skeptical. But I wasn&amp;#8217;t another woman. I was a woman ready to be swept away. I was a woman ready for her story to begin. As a writer, story was all that mattered. Rising action, dramatic complication, heroes and villains and dark plots. I believed I was the author of my life, that I controlled the narration.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From their first kiss, twenty-seven-year-old writer Danielle Trussoni is spellbound by a novelist from Bulgaria. The two share a love of jazz and books and travel, passions that intensify their whirlwind romance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years later, hopeful to renew their marriage, Danielle and&amp;#160;her husband&amp;#160;move to the south of France, to a picturesque medieval village in the Languedoc. It is here, in a haunted stone fortress built by the Knights Templar, that she comes to understand the dark, subterranean forces that have been following her all along. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Danielle and her husband eventually part, Danielle&#39;s time in the fortress brings precious wisdom about life and love that she could not have learned otherwise. Ultimately, she finds the strength to overcome her illusions, and start again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An incisive look at romantic love, &lt;em&gt;The Fortress&lt;/em&gt; is one woman&amp;#8217;s fight to understand the complexities of her own heart, told by one of the best writers of her generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
