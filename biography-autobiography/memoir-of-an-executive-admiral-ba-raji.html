  <title>Memoir of an Executive Admiral - Ba Raji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Memoir of an Executive Admiral is an insight into the career of retired Rear Admiral Bodunrin Raji in a mostly military-ruled Nigeria from 1975 to 2011. The story is told over a thirty-five-year period of the authors voluntary service in the Nigerian Navy. The pursuit of professionalism in the Nigerian Navy is relayed as a function of training and deployment, but not necessarily devoid of risks, intrigues, and occasional humour. A career in any chosen profession is fraught with challenges in a democracy where the subjugation of military to civil authority is taken for granted. The challenges are not only accentuated, but many careers were prematurely terminated through compulsory retirement or, in extreme cases, death by execution during the military rule in Nigeria. 
To successfully pursue and attain the highest professional level and rank in the Nigeria Armed Forces in the period spanned is not a mean achievement. In telling his story, retired Rear Admiral Raji provides answers to curious minds on the level of professionalism in the officer cadre of the Nigerian Armed Forces, inspires youths aspiring to join the officer cadre of navies, encourages serving officers, and advises them on preparations for life after retirement. Memoir of an Executive Admiral is educative and inspiring." />
