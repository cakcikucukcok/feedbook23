  <title>The Good, the Bad, and the Grace of God - Jep and Jessica Robertson, Susy Flory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Moving Story of Redemption and Second Chances&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p&gt;Jep Robertson, the youngest son of Duck Commander Phil Robertson, and his wife, Jessica, open up about their personal trials, their early years together, and the challenges that might have destroyed them both had the grace of God not intervened. Jep describes being molested as a child and his reluctance to tell anyone until only a few years ago, his downward spiral into drug and alcohol abuse, and the eventual intervention of his family. Jessica shares about the difficult failure of her first marriage while still a teenager and the hurt that came along with it, much of it from the church. Her insecurities spun out of control as she wondered whether she would ever be good enough or pretty enough. This book is their love story but, more importantly, their love story for God.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;We are desperate to let people know that no matter what you&amp;rsquo;ve done; no matter what you&amp;rsquo;ve lived through, you can come out of it.&amp;nbsp; You can be washed clean.&amp;nbsp; You are redeemed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
