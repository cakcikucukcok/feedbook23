  <title>Staying Happy, Healthy, and Hot - Dick Summer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Staying Happy, Healthy and Hot&lt;/em&gt;, author and  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame radio personality &lt;strong&gt;Dick Summer&lt;/strong&gt; introduces us to his brand new Louie Louie Generation. Louie Louie Ladies and Lads dont look like the people in the beer commercials with their fancy abs and perky breasts any more. But like their theme song, they have an avalanche of attitude. Its a happy attitude. And as you know, being happy helps keep you healthy. And when youre healthy you tend to be hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Staying Happy, Healthy And Hot &lt;/em&gt;is a collection of true stories about &lt;strong&gt;Dick Summers &lt;/strong&gt;life as a husband, a father, a grandfather, and just an every day guy. There are stories about his days as a national broadcasting personality, his career as a hypnotherapist and his passion for flying his airplane. But mostly it tells about his long, hot romance with his wife Barbara, or as he calls her, My Lady Wonder Wench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With humor and candor, this memoir shows how one man refuses to allow all the candles on his birthday cake to set off any sprinkler system that could put out the fire in his love affair with life, and with his wife.&lt;/p&gt;" />
