  <title>The Heat Reign: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat get their NBA title - South Florida Sun Sentinel Staff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;In Summer 2010, LeBron James took his talents to South Beach, bringing with him Chris Bosh to partner with Miami Heat superstar Dwyane Wade. The Big Three talked of winning multiple NBA championships and enormous expectations began to build&amp;#151;pressure that grew even stronger when the Heat lost the 2011 NBA Finals to the Dallas Mavericks.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There were rumblings about breaking up the team, or firing coach Erik Spoelstra, or both. New players joined the cast, and with James producing a league MVP season, the Heat rolled into the Eastern Conference finals despite injuries that limited the effectiveness of Bosh and Wade. Winning a championship would test the team like never before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Down 3 games to 2 in the East finals after losing at home in Game 5, Miami faced elimination and a defining moment for James. A spectacular performance by James forced a Game 7 in Miami, where a victory sent the Heat on to face the Oklahoma City Thunder&amp;#151;and clash with superstar Kevin Durant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Relive the Heat&amp;#8217;s march to the NBA championship  with stories, columns and photos from the &lt;I&gt;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&lt;/I&gt;.  From the unsung heroes to James&amp;#8217;s MVP performance and the post-title celebration, it&amp;#8217;s a story of validation, vindication and the ultimate victory.&lt;/div&gt;" />
