  <title>Stella&#39;s Girl - Captain Evelyn Decker U.S. Army</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book tells the story of Captain Evelyn Decker, a pioneer, as one of the first African American nurses to serve in the U.S. Army. Having grown up in an integrated, accepting community in upstate New York, she was surprised and dismayed by the continual discrimination and segregation she faced as she served her country. Her spirit and strength illuminate her narrative, a history that should never be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;In this book, Captain Decker details her early childhood, young adulthood, and her military career in this country and overseas, covering her experiences from World II through the Korean era   This autobiography explores Captain Decker&#39;s life and assesses her place in American military history. The book traces her personal and career development, her challenges, and her climb over insurmountable obstacles to obtain many decorations.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
-Dr. (Brigadier General) Carrie Nero, USA (Ret.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I feel honored to have read this book and I enjoyed it too! I believe the English used in this book is appropriate for Middle and Junior High School students. Good luck with the publication.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
