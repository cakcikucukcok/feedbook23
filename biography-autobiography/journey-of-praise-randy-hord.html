  <title>Journey of Praise - Randy Hord</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hello, this is ON-STAR&amp;hellip;we have received a signal that your mother&amp;rsquo;s left air bag has been deployed in her garage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This chilling statement was the second indication that something had happened to Mom that wasn&amp;rsquo;t good. The first had come a moment earlier from my friend Don.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Randy, this is Don. I just drove by your mother&amp;rsquo;s house and there are two state highway patrol cars parked in the drive. Do you want me to go back and see what&amp;rsquo;s going on and call you back?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The events that followed these exchanges would forever change my life and those of my family. In these moments we would be launched into an unimaginable journey through which God showed mercy, love, and guidance, and overwhelmed us with blessings beyond anything we ever thought was possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the weeks that followed God, Jehovah Jirah&amp;mdash;our provider, blessed us by using our friends, our neighbors, the hospital&amp;rsquo;s staff, and even people we had never met before. As blessings poured down on us, we were astounded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book, filled with scriptures, will provide you with hope in difficult times, with joy, with sorrow, with laughter, and with the insight that turning everything over to Him will provide you with peace that passes all understanding. After reading this book, you will never look at life&amp;rsquo;s heartaches and challenges in the same way again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is inspiring. It is emotional. It is joyous, but mostly, it is the true story of how God&amp;rsquo;s incredible ability to comfort and bless our family in our time of need gave us exactly what we needed and exactly when we needed it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
