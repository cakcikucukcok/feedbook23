  <title>My Colombian War - Silvana Paternostro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A timely, evocative account of a reporter&#39;s reckoning with her homeland&#39;s volatile past&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the coastal city of Barranquilla, Colombia, Silvana Paternostro indulged in the typical concerns of a privileged young girl: friendships and parties, school and family. But soon it became apparent that life in Colombia would not go on as usual. Strange planes appeared overhead, the harbingers of the marijuana drug trade that would explode into cocaine wars over the next decade, and soon after, a disputed election would lead to demonstrations and kidnappings targeting the affluent landed elite--including Paternostro&#39;s family. A revolution was brewing, and the social inequalities reflected in her life would boil over into the most violent, most protracted, and most misunderstood civil war of our time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;My Colombian War&lt;/i&gt;, Paternostro journeys back to the place where her family and her closest friends still live, weaving authentic experience into a history of this ongoing conflict. Through interviews she allows us to witness the treacherous war zone that Colombia has become, projected on the daily lives of its citizens. Paternostro&#39;s book is a stunning, comprehensive narrative of Colombia&#39;s past and present.&lt;/p&gt;" />
