  <title>Ninety Percent Mental - Bob Tewksbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Former Major League pitcher and mental skills coach for two of baseball&#39;s legendary franchises (the Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants) Bob Tewksbury takes fans inside the psychology of baseball.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Ninety Percent Mental&lt;/i&gt;, Bob Tewksbury shows readers a side of the game only he can provide, given his singular background as both a longtime MLB pitcher and a mental skills coach for two of the sport&#39;s most fabled franchises, the Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants. Fans watching the game on television or even at the stadium don&#39;t have access to the mind games a pitcher must play in order to get through an at-bat, an inning, a game. Tewksbury explores the fascinating psychology behind baseball, such as how players use techniques of imagery, self-awareness, and strategic thinking to maximize performance, and how a pitcher&#39;s strategy changes throughout a game. He also offers an in-depth look into some of baseball&#39;s most monumental moments and intimate anecdotes from a &quot;who&#39;s who&quot; of the game, including legendary players who Tewksbury played with and against (such as Mark McGwire, Craig Biggio, and Greg Maddux), game-changing managers and executives (Joe Torre, Bruce Bochy, Brian Sabean), and current star players (Jon Lester, Anthony Rizzo, Andrew Miller, Rich Hill).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Tewksbury&#39;s esoteric knowledge as a thinking-fan&#39;s player and his expertise as a &quot;baseball whisperer&quot;, this entertaining book is perfect for any fan who wants to see the game in a way he or she has never seen it before. &lt;i&gt;Ninety Percent Mental &lt;/i&gt;will deliver an unprecedented look at the mound games and mind games of Major League Baseball. &lt;br&gt;" />
