  <title>James Dean: Rebel Life - John Howlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James Dean died in 1955. The star of three movies, he was aged just 24. Six decades later, the charismatic screen idol has lost none of his power to captivate. Revered by fresh generations of fans born years after his untimely death, the glamor of his limited but incandescent legacy of cinematic classics - East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant - will never fade. Drawn from extensive research and original interviews, James Dean: Rebel Life strips back the hype to reveal the man behind the myth. Filled with the testimonies of the actors, directors and ex-lovers who knew Dean best, and lavishly illustrated with candid photos (from boyhood up to Dean&#39;s untimely death) and sumptuous film stills, the book provides a uniquely personal insight into the life and times of Hollywood&#39;s tragic leading man - essential reading for fans of every generation." />
