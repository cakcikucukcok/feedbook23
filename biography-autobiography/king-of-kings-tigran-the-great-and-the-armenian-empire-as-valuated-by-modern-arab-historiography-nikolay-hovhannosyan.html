  <title>King of Kings Tigran the Great and the Armenian Empire as Valuated by Modern Arab Historiography - Nikolay Hovhannosyan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To date, Tigran the Great&amp;rsquo;s life and activity (95-55 BC) were elucidated in world historiography mainly based on the Greek and Roman sources of the antique period, as well as the studies of western researchers of the new and newest periods. Arab sources, among others, remained out of scholars&amp;rsquo; vision.&lt;br /&gt;
The present work is the first attempt to elucidate, based on the most recent studies of the Arab scholars, the activity of Armenia&amp;rsquo;s King of Kings Tigran the Great, and the role of the founded by him Armenian Empire, which core constituted the Arab countries. Based on methodology of systematization and analysis, the opinions and conceptual views of today&amp;#39;s Arab historians, international relations experts, legal scholars and geographers, as well as their evaluation of the problem in question have been put into scientific circulation for the first time. This will contribute to conducting a deeper investigation and forming a clearer notion of the unique and important role of Tigran the Great in the highly complicated historical period as the years of his reign were.&lt;br /&gt;
Besides, the studies of the modern Arab authors are yet another evidence of the big interest, shown by foreign scholars in Tigran II and the Armenian Empire." />
