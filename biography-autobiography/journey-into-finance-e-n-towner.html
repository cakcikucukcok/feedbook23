  <title>Journey into Finance - E.N. Towner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My passion for financial education is rooted from a deep concern for youth aging out of foster care and their caregivers who havent had a formal education on the importance of money management and financial literacy. As a former foster child, I know firsthand how devastating the lack of financial education and resources can be for a child who already has one strike against them: being uprooted from their biological parents due to abuse and/or neglect. So I have dedicated my life to raising awareness and educating parents, teachers, and youth about the importance of having a sound understanding of the basics of personal finance to achieve success.
Journey Into Finance is about a young womans journey into the world of personal finance while working for one of the largest banks in the United States.  This book tells of her transformation out of poverty, lessons she learned from the rich and not so famous clients in the process, and spans over her lifetime.
