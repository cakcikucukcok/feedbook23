  <title>Bittersweet Grace - Percy Pendergrass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The silence of grace intertwines within this anecdotal review from Percy, a child born to divorced parents in rural Appalachia in the early 1940s. World War 
II is coming to an end, and a fear of communism smothers his community as they struggle to maintain their dignity to endure everyday living. He is 
encompassed by a strong spiritual family and adults friends who give encouragement and advice. However, Percys perception of himself is tattered and broken 
from guilt. Many children have these unfounded guilts, which are very real. The perceptions of a child are always different from those of others who witness 
the same events. This narrative of nonfiction gives Percy freedom to cradle his own perceptions of his truth through the muddy journey as a young boy 
slaying his own dragons with bittersweet victories. 
&lt;P&gt;Percys confidants have diverse backgrounds. Mr. Billingsley is his mentor in religious matters when blood family doesnt fit the needs of the moment. 
Dude is a mans man who gives all the worldly advice a boy should have. Doc is the intellectual coach for encouragement for loftier youth dreams. Walker 
serves as the back-seat driver to challenge and humble Percy at every turn. Walkers personality develops Percys embryo of benevolence to find a meaningful 
expression.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Because of the historic nature of the book, seasoned citizens can use it to reminisce with their children and grandchildren and others in their circle. 
Teenagers may read the book and get a glimpse into the past and be consoled that they are not alone with their demons. Grade-school children can easily read 
the book for entertainment because of the youthful language. People of faith may find hope within to be their victory and be encouraged by circumstances 
that surround the limited Bible verses. Tom, Dick, Harry, Sally, and Betty can just pick up the book and read for pure pleasure.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Percys grade-school education began in a one-room schoolhouse in southern Appalachia, which he attended during grades one thru six. The fear of 
communism permeated his rural community. Rich in Christian ethics and tenacity, Percy achieved his masters degree and worked as a soil conservationist. He 
retired on Sand Mountain, Alabama.&lt;/P&gt;" />
