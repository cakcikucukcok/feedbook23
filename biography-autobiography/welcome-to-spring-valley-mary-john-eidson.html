  <title>Welcome to Spring Valley - Mary John Eidson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Welcome to Spring Valley&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea seemed ridiculously far-fetched. Why would a young couple with small children want a place in the wilds of east Texas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep in the forest of east Texas lots of hickory and oak trees grow. A beautiful part of the state, there is lots of wildlife; whitetail deer roam, beaver hide in marshes, raccoons play, and a whole world of birds call it home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a story about my family. Getting acquainted with varied forms of wildlife was truly an exciting adventure. The whitetail deer racing to jump the fence, raccoons peeping in the window at us, beaver splashing in the water, and placing small fingerlings in a new pond to grow and get ready for the frying pan were activities that will not be forgotten. Was this a dream or a nightmare?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A site overlooking the valley was the chosen spot for our cabin to be built. It also prompted the name of this book as live springs were discovered in the valley; springs bubbling out of the earth, too beautiful to describe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each trip was full of challenges; but also many rewards. Building a pond and the purchase of a fl at bottom boat made fishing, swimming, and relaxing in the sun possible. Soon it became important to own horses. Six horses soon called Spring Valley home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look back at memorable times, many things come to mind. I will be forever grateful that the No in my mind became Yes on my lips.&lt;/p&gt;" />
