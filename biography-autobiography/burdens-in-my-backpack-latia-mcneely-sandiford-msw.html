  <title>Burdens in My Backpack - LaTia McNeely-Sandiford Msw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LaTia was raised in urban Jersey City amidst the perils of poverty and addiction. Drugs killed her mother and tortured her father for thirty plus years. LaTia grew up alone and traumatized left to thrive in an environment succumb by drugs, violence, chaos and dysfunction. 
Her journey to success was filled with despair. As an only child, she often found herself isolated and alone. The guilt of feeling like she caused her mothers death took root inside her soul. LaTia was broken. At home she was invisible, so she looked for love in the arms of ill intentioned males. 
At the age of 13, LaTia had her first child. Then, a series of failed relationships left her battered, abused and emotionally damaged. She lived a life consumed by guilt and shame as she struggled to keep her many secrets. Her days were uncertain and her future looked grim. However, LaTia was determined to succeed, shouldering her Burdens in Her Backpack. 
Although, LaTias grandmothers, Berdie and Catherine always loved her unconditionally, she eventually hit rock bottom before acknowledging her true Worth. 
At the lowest point of her life, LaTia met Roger. He would be the driving force of the spiritual awakening that changed her life forever. 
LaTia story is living proof that we all have purpose and our lives are part of a greater plan than our own." />
