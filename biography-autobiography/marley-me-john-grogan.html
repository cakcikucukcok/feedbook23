  <title>Marley &amp; Me - John Grogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for humans to discover the key to happiness through a bigger-than-life, bad-boy dog? Just ask the Grogans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John and Jenny were just beginning their life together. They were young and in love, with not a care in the world. Then they brought home Marley, a wiggly yellow furball of a puppy. Life would never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marley grew into a barreling, ninety-seven-pound streamroller of a Labrador retriever. He crashed through screen doors, gouged through drywall, and stole women&#39;s undergarments. Obedience school did no good -- Marley was expelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just as Marley joyfully refused any limits on his behavior, his love and loyalty were boundless, too. Marley remained a model of devotion, even when his family was at its wit&#39;s end. Unconditional love, they would learn, comes in many forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marley &amp;#38; Me&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is&amp;#160;John Grogan&#39;s funny, unforgettable tribute to this wonderful, wildly neurotic Lab and the meaning he brought to their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
