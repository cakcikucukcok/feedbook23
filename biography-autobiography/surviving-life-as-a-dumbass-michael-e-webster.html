  <title>Surviving Life as a Dumbass - Michael E. Webster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael E. Webster&#39;s story begins in the Navy, where he becomes an aggressive alcoholic, managing to survive a series of episodes that should have been deadly. Still, he manages to graduate from two top Navy schools.&lt;/P&gt;
After being discharged, Webster returns to his hometown, but he has no plans for the future. Through the help of family members, friends and others, he returns to school and meets future wife Peggy, who supports him through his many relapses into the dark throes of alcoholism.&lt;/p&gt;
Webster finally realizes he&#39;s hit rock bottom, but not until others almost lose their lives. At the age of 33-overweight and out of shape-he joins a Tae Kwon Do school and begins a physically painful journey as he learns how to beat his addiction.&lt;/P&gt;
For 30 years, Webster has continued his journey, and in the process, he&#39;s helped others to change their lives. He teaches martial arts at no cost to those needing discipline in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
Join Webster as he battles demons of his own making and journeys down a road to self-improvement in &lt;I&gt;Surviving Life as a Dumbass&lt;/I&gt;." />
