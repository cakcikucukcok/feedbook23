  <title>Chopin and His World - Jonathan D. Bellman, Halina Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new look at the life, times, and music of Polish composer and piano virtuoso Fryderyk Chopin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fryderyk Chopin (1810&amp;#8211;49), although the most beloved of  piano composers, remains a contradictory figure, an artist of virtually  universal appeal who preferred the company of only a few sympathetic friends  and listeners. &lt;i&gt;Chopin and His World&lt;/i&gt; reexamines  Chopin and his music in light of the cultural narratives formed during his  lifetime. These include the romanticism of the ailing spirit, tragically singing  its death-song as life ebbs; the Polish expatriate, helpless witness to the  martyrdom of his beloved homeland, exiled among friendly but uncomprehending  strangers; the sorcerer-bard of dream, memory, and Gothic terror; and the  pianist&#39;s pianist, shunning the appreciative crowds yet composing and  improvising idealized operas, scenes, dances, and narratives in the shadow of  virtuoso-idol Franz Liszt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The international Chopin scholars gathered here demonstrate  the ways in which Chopin responded to and was understood to exemplify these  narratives, as an artist of his own time and one who transcended it. This collection  also offers recently rediscovered artistic representations of his hands (with  analysis), and&amp;#8212;for the first time in English&amp;#8212;an extended tribute to Chopin  published in Poland upon his death and contemporary Polish writings  contextualizing Chopin&#39;s compositional strategies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contributors are Jonathan D.  Bellman, Leon Botstein, Jean-Jacques Eigeldinger, Halina Goldberg, Jeffrey  Kallberg, David Kasunic, Anatole Leikin, Eric McKee, James Parakilas, John  Rink, and Sandra P. Rosenblum. Contemporary documents by Karol Kurpi&amp;#324;ski, Adam  Mickiewicz, and J&amp;#243;zef Sikorski are included.&lt;/p&gt;" />
