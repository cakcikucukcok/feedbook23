  <title>Words of Wisdom, Inspiration, Humor, and Compassion from Someone Who Knows the Difference - Delores Anderson Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This little book of poems and short stories is dedicated to my children, who gave me the will to fight for my life. 
Also, I want to thank my doctors, nurses, family, friends, and those who have fought breast cancer and lived to tell their story. I had to keep a positive attitude in order to beat cancer. I lost my mother and several close friends to this disease. When I heard the word cancer, the first thing that came to my mind was that I was going to die with cancer like my mother. 
This little book will make you laugh or cry. Writing this little book took me nine years. I am doing Gods will by helping, talking, and sharing my story with you. 
God spared my life for a reason. It was not for me to dwell on what has befallen me but to encourage and be encouraged. I am reaching out to help others. 
Read this Christ-inspired book. Let the love, healing, and helping others flow in. Again, I thank my doctors, my nurses, and everyone for your support. God is the head of my life, and I pray that he is also the head of yours. Blessings and happy reading." />
