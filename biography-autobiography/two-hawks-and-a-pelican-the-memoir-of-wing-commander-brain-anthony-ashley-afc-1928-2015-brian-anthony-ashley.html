  <title>Two Hawks and a Pelican: The Memoir of Wing Commander Brain Anthony Ashley AFC (1928 - 2015) - Brian Anthony Ashley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the story of a Lincolnshire farm boy who dreamed of being a pilot. Despite leaving school at just 14 to work for the BBC, followed by a stint in the Royal Navy, he finally managed to join the RAF in 1950.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book follows his career from flight training in Tiger Moths all the way through to the Buccaneer. Over his years in the RAF he amassed a staggering 3,160 flight hours, in 42 different aircraft; certainly one of the most prolific pilots of his generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was a photo reconnaissance pilot in the Cold War, flew a Meteor in the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Coronation Flypast, completed the Empire Test Pilots Course at Farnborough, gained A1 QFI category and Command Instrument Rating Examiners rating in all four categories of aircraft, and enjoyed every moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian loved to fly, and did anything to beg or borrow any serviceable aircraft whenever possible for a try out. However, his greatest love was the Meteor, in which he flew many displays. He always likened it to a lady; temperamental but well-behaved if handled correctly, deadly if not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two Hawks of the title are silver statuettes of the Staff College Hawk of Horus, one awarded from the Staff College at RAF Andover, and the other from the Staff College at RAF Brampton; these together with the Pelican from the Central Flying School, make a unique collection, of which Brian was very proud.&lt;/p&gt;" />
