  <title>The Song of Africa - Isaac Benatar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Ivan Bender, growing up in a new resources rich country - Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), during one of the most violent periods of African history from 1948 to 1980. After a threatening encounter with a crocodile, an Ndebele warrior is assigned the job of being Ivan&#39;s guardian.
A strong friendship develops between the warrior and the boy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivan&#39;s father is stricken by malaria and the family is forced to move to the city. There, two black waifs are taken into the Bender home. One, Enock, in time becomes a notorious guerrilla known as &quot;One Eye&quot;. The other, Amos, becomes a policeman and a member of the Selous Scouts - a highly effective government anti-terrorist group. Ivan goes to the assistance of refugees fleeing from Katanga during the civil war erupting in Zaire. He meets a young girl, Chantelle, and a romance develops. Ivan&#39;s life becomes filled with adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts are politically accurate. Many of the events described are also true and are based on the author&#39;s and family experiences, though, on occasion literary license has been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isaac Benatar (LL.B) is a law graduate of the University of London. He was born in Zimbabwe in 1943. Elected Youth Mayor of the city of Salisbury during 1965-66. Became public prosecutor in Rhodesia from 1970 to 1980. He emigrated to the United States in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;" />
