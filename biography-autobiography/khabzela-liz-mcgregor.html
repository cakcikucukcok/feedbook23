  <title>Khabzela - Liz Mcgregor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Liz McGregor follows the fortunes of South African Fana Khaba, a boy from a severely disadvantaged township background, a former taxi-driver, who achieves celebrity status and a cult following as the most popular DJ on Gauteng&#39;s new youth radio station, only to die tragically and prematurely from AIDS. Khabzela had it all - money, fame and a string of women, literally lining up at his bedroom door. His promiscuity made him a high-risk candidate for AIDS - there was wide-spread support when he came out on air with his diagnosis - but why would such a modern, urban man refuse the treatment that could have prolonged his life so significantly? McGregor paints a vivid picture of a society evolving from a complex and damaged past. She takes readers back to the days of Sophiatown - vibrant, multi-cultured, razed to the ground; replaced by the match-box houses of Soweto with curfews and restrictions; post-1994, a draw-card for all-night street bashes, fuelled by dagga, beer and the hybrid beat of kwaito music; the vibe in Rosebank as emerging radio station Yfm played music not heard on the local airways before. The excitement is tangible... Khabzela provides a valuable record of an extraordinary time in South Africa&#39;s history." />
