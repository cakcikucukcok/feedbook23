  <title>Everything - Janine Cummings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Everything&amp;#39; is a euphemism for &amp;quot;the man who is everything&amp;quot;, and the true story about a woman&amp;#39;s journey through loss, to recovery and finally, to victory - it&amp;#39;s the author&amp;#39;s personal story. It recounts the events of a spiritual voyage that began with a love relationship and an introduction to God through a man who greatly impacted her thoughts, beliefs and emotions, and made her question everything about herself and her approach to love. The story takes us through this intimate journey that sees many highs and lows as the relationships she experiences with both a man and God dramatically changes. The reader is given an opportunity to travel through this very truthful account of her emotional struggles with maintaining her identity, worth and value as an individual, but more importantly, with finding her place as a woman in Christ. We witness raw emotion and human frailty with the dramatic end of her relationship with Everything, and the adversity and testing that comes with dealing with the loss and sense of rejection. The climatic end, however, gives birth to a new beginning that sees her relationship with God grow and deepen to a greater understanding of the true meaning of unconditional love. Everything is filled with honesty at its painful best, and touching moments that will encourage and empower anyone who has ever been caught up in the wrong relationship. It speaks to the hearts of both men and women and excludes no one with its universal message of faith in love. There&amp;#39;s hope here and we walk away with a sense of empathy, knowing that we&amp;#39;re not alone either in our quest for our own &amp;quot;Everything&amp;quot; or our need for the supernatural love that can only come from the Greatest Love of All&lt;/p&gt;" />
