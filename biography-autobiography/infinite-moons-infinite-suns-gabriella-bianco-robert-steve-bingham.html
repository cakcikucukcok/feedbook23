  <title>Infinite Moons, Infinite Suns - Gabriella Bianco, Robert Steve Bingham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this precious poetic autobiography, Gabriella Bianco not only tells the final hour of an existencethat of her son Robert Steve but also the loss of a great love, in a world full of absences. Gabriella Bianco challenges her destiny, inviting us to the caducity of all that surrounds usfeelings, love, life and even the most precious gift, a son.
 In the loving relation not only with language and poetry, but also with the drama of life, Bianco needs to reveal a secrether sons deathand share it with her sons father, as a moral and absolute duty. From the point of view of the truth and the death of a child, this text is sacred, although, refusing to take the place of the victim under the circumstances, Bianco knowslike all tragic heroes that nothing different would have been possible with her destiny. 
This valuable literary narration reaches a deeply dramatic effect, as it is so painfully connected to a vital experience. The story always speaks about love, charging this word with immense emotion, whispering words in their agonizing beauty. Bianco tells us what she knows about herself and about the facts, digging in her own soul, with perplexity and nostalgia.
 In this story, the past is a split mirror, where nothing turned out to be the same. Here the theme of love has the marks of time and renunciation, the mark of destiny. In this narration, Bianco reaches a balance of great beauty, between said and unspoken words, between suggested and explicit thoughts, in a great richness of nuances, when the text turns unstable, facing the emotions stirred up by this testimony." />
