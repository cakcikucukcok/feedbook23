  <title>Once in a Lifetime Comes a Man - Grace Larson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fate was a blessing when a dream brought Lyle into my life once more. He was forty-six years old and had never married. It had been eighteen years since wed seen each other. I was almost forty-two with three adult children and two ready to graduate high school. 
It is only once in a lifetime that a person is lucky enough to have true love. I had that with Lyle, and it is only with writing this book and reading his letters that I fully realize the depth of his being and his love for me. 
I heard this on a news program on marriage: It is rewarding to know someone has been a witness to your life . I am that witness to Lyles life. Our song will endure through eternity.
I hope that in reading this, you will appreciate the soft heart, humor, intelligence, and love that was Lyle. The love he had for his family, animals, and creation. He was a man of integrity and fine character and a good listener. The mark of a man is how a man lives his life and my husband was that mana good man who had a great mother and father." />
