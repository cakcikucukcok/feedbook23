  <title>The Groove Project - Paul Heagen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Paul, a shy Midwestern teenager moves to California at the height of the muscle car era and is taken under wing by class clown Mark, who concocts a scheme to have the two of them overhaul a broken-down &#39;57 Chevy into a hot rod. Except Mark never bothers to disclose he knows nothing about rebuilding cars.  
&lt;p&gt;The two hapless mechanics triumph in their quest, but a tragedy pulls them apart and they go their separate ways. 
Everything changes, though, when a flood of eerie e-mails one night from Mark 30 years later convinces Paul that Mark has also failed to disclose something else  and it is a matter of life and death.

&lt;i&gt;The Groove Project&lt;/i&gt; pulses with the sights and sounds of an unprecedented period in American history. It tells a timeless story about the struggle to find your own path in life and the stubborn faith that marks who your friends really are." />
