  <title>The Indian Autobiographies in English - Rcp Sinha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Self-portrayal has become an integral part of modern culture and India equally shares this universal mood. A large number of Indians have committed themselves to the writing of their autobiographies in English as well as in the regional languages. It is exciting to know that those in English have been produced by some of the finest minds of the country, such as Raja Rammohun Roy, Lal Behari Day, Surendra Nath Banerjea, Bipin Chandra Pal, Lala Lajpat Rai, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, P.C. Roy, S. Radhakrishnan, Sachchidanand Sinha and Nirad C. Chaudhury. It is highly fascinating to read their testimony in the shaping of modern Indian history. Even more exciting are the glimpses into their private lives and the interrelation between the portrait and the man. This study is the first comprehensive attempt to critically evaluate these works and shows how in modern times Indians begin to get over the proverbial Indian inhibition in talking of private affairs hesitatingly first and then with a devastating even embarrassing frankness. This study, in passing also tries to dispel the impression that no autobiographical tradition existed in ancient and medieval India." />
