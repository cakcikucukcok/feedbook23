  <title>Andros Odyssey:  Liberation - Stavros Boinodiris Phd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The daughter of a rich Greek family in Constantinople escapes from her dysfunctional
family by getting romantically involved with a handsome visiting
peasant. This union produced a little boy, Anthony Boyun-egri-oglou.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony grew up during troubling times. He saw very little of his father, who
left for Constantinople and then Russia, to escape from being drafted in the
Turkish army. He grew up in the shadows of the Ottoman Empire as it was
going through major revolutions and wars. The First World War (1914-1918)
followed, causing shortages and anguish on Cappadocian Greeks and Turks
alike. After this war, the disastrous Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922) began. In
the ensuing truce, Greece and Turkey agreed to an exchange of populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uprooting (1924) of the Boyun-egri-oglou family involved an arduous trip,
involving cart, rail and ship transports. These people left almost twelve hundred
years of history behind, to seek freedom and self determination in a troubled
state, overburdened with refugees. The struggle of the refugees is recounted by
Anthony very graphically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1940, after several recoveries and disasters, Greece enters into war with Italy,
turning Anthonys hopes for recovery into an impossible dream.&lt;/p&gt;" />
