  <title>Journey of Faith - Anthony Anei Majok, Jenan Jones Benson, Barbara Baillet Moran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seven-year-old Anthony Majok was torn from his happy African village and began running for his life, due to ongoing civil war, sparked by religious and political strife. The Christian Majok family, along with many others, refused to take up the Islam faith. Over the next 17 years, Majok and thousands of lost boys and girls of Sudan battled well-armed soldiers, vicious animals, hunger and disease as they fled across the continent. Set in South Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and, finally, the United States, it is Majoks unwavering faith that helps him withstand devastating hardship. 
Journey of Faith conveys not only Majoks moving personal story, it illuminates the reasons for decades of war in Sudan." />
