  <title>Fabulous Fred - Paul Amy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fred Cook began his football career with Footscray in the VFL. But he really made his name in the game after crossing to Port Melbourne in the VFA.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;His prodigious goalkicking in the 1970s earned him the nickname of &#39;Fabulous Fred&#39; and fame at a pop-star level. He appeared on TV, on radio and wrote newspaper columns, and he mixed with Melbourne&#39;s sporting and entertainment elite.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But he fell in with a criminal crowd, formed a drug habit, lost everything and did three spells in prison.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cook has led a remarkable life, going from hero to zero. He&#39;s always wanted to tell his story, which features football, crime and drugs, and the wider issue of sportspeople who struggle with normalcy once their careers have ended.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Fred Cook&#39;s name still resonates, thirty years after his career ended. Last year he was nominated for the Australian Football Hall of Fame." />
