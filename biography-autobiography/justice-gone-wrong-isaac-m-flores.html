  <title>Justice Gone Wrong - Isaac M. Flores</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From beginning to end, the 28-year tenure of Sheriff Willis V. McCall was studded with controversial cases  including his own murder trial on a charge of kicking a black prisoner to death in his jail cell. McCall&#39;s very name still conjures up visions of riots, killings and racism in rural America. He reigned supreme over an area that now adjoins the Florida home of Mickey Mouse.&lt;p&gt; 
His exploits in the enforcement of his own brand of lawandorder brought him under frequent investigation from governors, local, state and federal grand juries and up through the U.S. Supreme Court. The book is a nonfiction account about an era that has virtually been forgotten or pushed aside in our memories. It is in narrativealmost fictionalform. It is unique in its field because it deals generally with a period of time, rather than with one or two sensational aspects of it.&lt;p&gt; 
The work is thoroughly researched  including interviews, public records, private correspondence, trial testimony, official investigative reports and the journalism of the time. It revolves around one person but, more importantly, it is about a culture in our society that still remains with us to a limited extent." />
