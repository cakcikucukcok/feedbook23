  <title>Saving Larry - Larry Dale Fernatt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book tells the true story of a young man who served his country well in both the United States Marines and the United States Army. It gives the horrendous events surrounding his time in Vietnam, his injuries so critical, his death seem imminent. It details his recovery time of nearly three years in Walter Reed Hospital.
After returning home, he took whatever job he could find. Later his near death experience in the coal mines cost him another eighteen months out of work. The night of the accident in the mines, just before the kettlebottom fell, he was sure he heard a voice telling him to turn around and when he did, the kettlebottom fell from the roof and crushed his leg. There was no one around to warn him, so where did that voice come from. 
He had always stressed that he didn&#39;t need anyone, but he had a wife and three sons who always felt they were on the outside looking in on his life. Since he couldn&#39;t share himself for fear of being hurt, he built a wall and even God wasn&#39;t invited in. In 2014, the wall started crumbling when he found himself in a situation beyond his control." />
