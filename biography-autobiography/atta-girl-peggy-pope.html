  <title>Atta Girl - Peggy Pope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Ann Miller to Jimmy Stewart, from Marilyn Monroe to George Clooney to Sir Laurence Olivier, Giancarlo Menotti, Dolly Parton, Billy Crystal, and a host of others, author and actress Peggy Pope has crossed paths with a number of extraordinary artists. In &lt;i&gt;atta girl&lt;/i&gt;, she tells stories from her life, beginning with her childhood in Montclair, New Jersey, in the 1930s as she acts her way through the years to the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;She belongs to that group of professional actors who travels from from job to job and coast to coast performing on stage, film, television, cabaret, and commercials. She writes in detail about her work as well as how she got into show business where she gave advice to Dolly Parton in &lt;i&gt;9 to 5&lt;/i&gt;, gave Billy Crystal a hard time on &lt;i&gt;SOAP&lt;/i&gt;, and acted in an EMMY winning episode of Barney Miller. On ER she was brought in for a psychiatric evaluation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Filled with humorous touches, &lt;i&gt;atta girl&lt;/i&gt; offers a potpourri of stories from the trenches and gives an insiders look at both the joys and challenges of show business.&lt;/p&gt;" />
