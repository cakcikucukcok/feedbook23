  <title>Primo Levi - Ian Thomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Primo Levi, author of &lt;i&gt;Survival in Auschwitz &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Periodic Table&lt;/i&gt;, wrote books that have been called the essential works of humankind. Yet he lived an unremarkable existence, remaining until his death in the house in which he&#39;d been born; managing a paint and varnish factory for thirty years; and tending his invalid mother to the last. Now, in a matchless account, Ian Thomson unravels the strands of a life as improbable as it was influential, the story of the most modest of men who became a universal touchstone of conscience and humanism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on exclusive access to family members and previously unseen correspondence, Thomson reconstructs the world of Levi&#39;s youth--the rhythms of Jewish life in Turin during the Mussolini years--as well as his experience in Auschwitz and difficult reintegration into postwar Italy. Thomson presents Levi in all his facets: his fondness for Louis Armstrong and fast cars, his insomnia and many near-catastrophic work accidents. Finally, he explores the controversy and isolation of Levi&#39;s later years, along with the increasing tensions in his life--between his private anguish and gift for friendship; his severe bouts of depression and passion for life and ideas; his pervasive dread and reasoned, pragmatic ethic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praised in Britain as &quot;the best sort of history&quot; and &quot;a model of its kind,&quot;&lt;i&gt; Primo Levi: A Life &lt;/i&gt;is certain to take its place as the standard biography and a necessary companion to the works themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
