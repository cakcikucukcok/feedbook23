  <title>Never Anticipate the Command - Lee Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During her childhood, Lee Summers came to realize what a special father she had in Henry Sonnenfeld, a former US Marine. He instilled discipline and commitment in her, and he taught her about sacrifice, heroism, and patriotism. Best of all, he had wonderful bedtime stories.
Never Anticipate the Command is the first in a series to share Henrys remarkable stories of being a US Marine during World War II and the Korean War. As told through his daughter, Henry reveals how, as a young man from New Jersey, he enlisted in the US Marine Corps after Pearl Harbor and fought the Japanese in the brutal Pacific campaign.
Henry relates those first few harrowing days as a marine and the grueling training regimen on Parris Island. With remarkably vivid details, he recounts life on the island of Bougainville; tells the tale of his island pet, a womp-cat named Bougie Sam; and describes watching Pappy Boyingtons Black Sheep Squadron perform. 
Never Anticipate the Command recalls an era when men rose to action to protect their country. It shows how one man in particular served God, his country, and his familyin that order." />
