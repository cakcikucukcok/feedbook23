  <title>Rocky Spirit - Felice Cantatore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Rocky Balboa set a goal to go the distance against Apollo Creed, moviegoers everywhere found themselves rooting for the underdog, including author Felice Cantatore, who was just eleven years old when he first saw the film.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Going the distance became a metaphor for Cantatores own life, and the premise led to an appreciation and fascination with the film franchise. Just like Rocky, he went on to become an underdog fighter in the ring, and was also a ringside extra in the final movie of the series.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Join him as he shares his passion for the Rocky movies, and learn how their message inspired him to pursue and accomplish his goals. The lives of both Cantatore and Rocky Balboa are pure examples of how the Law of Attraction, hard work, and tenacity can lead to success.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;You can accomplish anything you want as long as you decide to go for it. Get motivated to pursue your goals, recognize that a champion resides in your heart, and unlock your &lt;i&gt;Rocky Spirit&lt;/i&gt; with this true story about the passion, dreams and success of an everyday man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
