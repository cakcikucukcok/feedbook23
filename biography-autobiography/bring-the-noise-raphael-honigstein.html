  <title>Bring the Noise - Raphael Honigstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jürgen Klopp&#39;s coaching career began in the German second tier at the unfashionable club of FSV Mainz 05, whom he steered to the Bundesliga for the first time in forty-one years. In 2008, he joined Borussia Dortmund, where he achieved back-to-back league titles and took the club to the UEFA Champions League final. He left Germany for one of the England&#39;s most challenging jobs: to manage Liverpool, a once-mighty club that had not managed sustained success since the 1980s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was not a task for the fainthearted. Anfield, Liverpool&#39;s home, is a temple to flamboyant attacking soccer powered by passion. In Klopp, Liverpool finally found a manager who embodied the essence of the club. Klopp is dynamic, expressive, restless, driven-he feels every move and play, every tactical shift, every contact on the field. His eyes betray a wild ecstasy and agony as his team thrives or falls. His game plan demands relentless commitment-the famous gegenpress-and he is one of the great personal motivators in all sport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Raphael Honigstein, author of Das Reboot and Budesliga correspondent for the Guardian, has interviewed Klopp and followed his career since his early years, and better than anyone knows how to &quot;bring the noise&quot; to his subject.&lt;br&gt;" />
