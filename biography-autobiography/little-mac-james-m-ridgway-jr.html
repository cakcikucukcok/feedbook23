  <title>Little Mac - James M. Ridgway Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Here the author tells the intriguing story of the controversial Union general of the American Civil War, George B. McClellan (affectionately know to the men who fought under him as Little Mac). It is a blistering refutation of the radical Republican inspired history of the general as carried into the Twenty First Century by revisionist historians. The book reveals how and why so many politicians, historians, and writers over the years have found it both convenient and necessary to undermine and belittle the accomplishments of this great American patriot. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In general the book supports and expands the positive view of McClellan as expressed by Warren W. Hassler in his 1957 book, General George B. McClellan: Shield of the Union. Conversely, it disputes many of the negative conclusions of the general as offered by Stephen W. Sears in his 1988 book, George B. McClellan: The Young Napoleon, as well as other works that Sears has written of the general. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It is all here: McClellans formative years; his Mexican War experience; the love of his life; the breakup of friendships; his relationship with Lincoln; the back-stabbing of his political enemies led by the conniving secretary of war, Edwin McMasters Stanton; his strategies; his battlefield opponents; and of course the bloody battles themselves.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;For those conditioned to viewing George McClellan in a stereotypically negative way, the book will be something of a shock. Conversely, for those who see beyond the historical smear of the general, the book will be a pure delight.&lt;/P&gt;" />
