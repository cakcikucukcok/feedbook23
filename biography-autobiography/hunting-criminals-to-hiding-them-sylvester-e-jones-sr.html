  <title>Hunting Criminals to Hiding Them - Sylvester E. Jones Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The manuscript, Hunting Criminals to Hiding Them, My Journey to and with the United States Marshals Service, is the story of my career working with the oldest federal law enforcement agency, the U.S. Marshals Service.
I begin with my childhood years in Chicago, Illinois, and discuss my three dreams and goals of playing professional football, serving in the military, and becoming a police officer. I was able to accomplish two of my goals - serving 25 years part-time in the military, while simultaneously working for the Markham Police Department and then the U.S. Marshals Service. My family and several good friends are briefly mentioned, including my fugitive partner, and a longtime military colleague and friend. 
I talk about various phases of my career climbing the ladder in the U.S. Marshals Service, including serving as a Chief Inspector in the Prisoner Services Division to my historic appointment as the first African American Deputy Marshal to be promoted to the Senior Executive Service as an Assistant Director. My journey discusses significant achievements I made protecting federal judges and federal court facilities. 
The main focus of the book is my love of hunting and arresting criminal fugitives, and subsequently spending the last nine years of my U.S. Marshals Service career working diligently to hide and safeguard them in the Witness Security Program. I discuss a number of cases I worked on and made arrests for.
I also mention major enhancements I implemented for the Witness Security Program including the establishment of International Symposiums on Witness Security, partnering with INTERPOL and other international organizations.
Lastly, I write about my travel around the globe assisting countries to establish or enhance Witness Protection Programs in efforts to maintain and preserve justice." />
