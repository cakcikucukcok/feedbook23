  <title>From Roadside to the Royal Family - D.C. Kaushal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Roadside to Worldwide Ministry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have waited a long time for this story to be told. Over the years, I have heard bits and pieces, but this is my first time hearing all of it. Bro. D.C. is one of the finest, dedicated men I know. His life is a living example of hope for all who are looking for the evidence of God&amp;rsquo;s redemption and purpose in each of us. I encourage you to read this book and be challenged in your own life to do greater things in the kingdom of God.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;Dr. James Graham, President, International Gospel Outreach&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My life was influenced as a teenager when I heard the testimony of D.C. Kaushal in an All India Pentecostal Convention in Chandigarh. What follows is his adventurous journey with Jesus Christ and body of believers, full of excitement and challenges.... His story will encourage those who are changed by Christ to take up their cross and follow him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;Rev. Dr. Richard Howell, Secretary, EFICC, Principal, Caleb Institute of Theology, General Secretary, Asia Evangelical Alliance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The person whose biography you are holding in your hands right now is not only a good writer and thinker, but is a true Christian, who has learned to give thanks to the Lord in all things.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;Pastor Neeraj Kumar Simpson, Grace upon Grace Church, New Delhi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;D.C. Kaushal was born into a Hindu family in Punjab, India. For many years he served the Lord as Director of India Every Home Crusade. He received a B.A. from Nagpur University and a B.D from Union Biblical Seminary. He has also received a M.Th and D.Min from Western Theological Seminary. He is the founder of Living Hope Ministries, and along with his wife and children, is presently serving God through Mercy Children&amp;rsquo;s Home, Slum School, Bible School, and Church planting.&lt;/p&gt;" />
