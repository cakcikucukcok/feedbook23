  <title>Fear No Men - Lonely Wolf, Marinela Christel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A child born in a Communist country. A car accident. 
 Unfaithful husbands and fathers. Unfortunate friends, relatives and strangers. &lt;p&gt;
 Corrupt role models. &lt;p&gt;
 City life or Transylvanian villages steeped in centuries of blood and traditions.&lt;p&gt;
 Gypsy fortunes and misfortunes; sharing fruit with the Communist President. &lt;p&gt;
                  With stigma attached to her like a Jewish star or a cow brand, a little girl encounters termination over and over and the scars map the way to the beginning of the road ahead.&lt;p&gt;
                  The perseverance to wage battle against the odds with rudimentary weapons fashioned from experience in the school of Hard-Knocks would drive anyone else into the faraway fields of madness and mayhem.&lt;p&gt;
Her splayed footprints follow the paw prints of her model and mentor, the wolf; always faithful, always courageous, always committed and always working for the good of the pack.&lt;p&gt;
                  Her tragic yet childish innocence attracts predators along the way and she learns how to heal the pain within, by becoming even more passionate and compassionate of human nature, never losing faith in her power to change destiny.&lt;p&gt;
                 Follow this child as she grows up under the Communist umbrella. At times her trips are violent, sometimes funny, sometimes deadly, but during many stumbles, falls and scrapes, she will take you into the twisted world of adults, to show you the light in her spirit and her unshakable power of believing in oneself.&lt;p&gt;
                 Due to the graphic nature and details in her world, adults will feel uncomfortable and younger audiences should not attempt to enter.&lt;p&gt;
The language used is that of the narrator as a child who becomes a teen and then a young-adult, throughout the chapters of her life.&lt;p&gt;
Whoever considered or labeled this child crazy, is either dead, old, or otherwise committed to the solitude of eternal damnation and any similarities to real people in life is purely coincidental." />
