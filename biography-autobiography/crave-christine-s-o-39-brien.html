  <title>Crave - Christine S. O&#39;Brien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do you mind that I&#39;m going to be writing a book about the fact that I was hungry?&quot; I asked my mother. &quot;Just tell a good story,&quot; she replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunger comes in many forms. In her memoir, &lt;i&gt;Crave&lt;/i&gt;, Christine S. O&#39;Brien tells a story of family turmoil and incessant hunger hidden behind the luxury and privilege of New York&#39;s famed Dakota apartment building.  Her explosively angry father was ABC Executive Ed Scherick, the successful television and film producer who created shows and films like &lt;i&gt;ABC&#39;s Wide World of Sports &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Stepford Wives&lt;/i&gt;. Raised on farm in the Midwest, her calm, beautiful mother Carol narrowly survived a dramatic accident when she was child. There was no hint of instability in her life until one day she collapsed in the family&#39;s apartment and spent the next year in bed. &quot;Your mother&#39;s illness is not physical,&quot; Christine&#39;s father tells her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craving a cure for a malady that the doctors said had no physical basis, Carol resorted to increasingly bizarre nutritional diets--from raw liver to fresh yeast--before beginning a rigid dietary regime known as &quot;The Program.&quot; It consisted largely of celery juice and blended salads&lt;i&gt;--&lt;/i&gt;a forerunner of today&#39;s smoothie. Determined to preserve the health of her family, Carol insisted that they follow The Program. Despite their constant hunger, Christine and her three younger brothers loyally followed their mother&#39;s eating plan, even as their father&#39;s rage grew and grew. The more their father screamed, the more their mother&#39;s very survival seemed to depend on their total adherence to The Program. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This well-meant tyranny of the dinner table led Christine to her own cravings for family, for food, and for the words to tell the story of her hunger. &lt;i&gt;Crave&lt;/i&gt; is the chronicle of Christine&#39;s painful and ultimately satisfying awakening. And, just as her mother asked, it&#39;s a good story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
