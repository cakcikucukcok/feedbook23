  <title>How Sweet the Bitter Fruit - Anne Breheney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is there a God?  
Does He love us? 
Is it possible to ask questions of Him and get answers?  
Can our sufferings actually become the greatest gift imaginable?  
Can true beauty really come from the ugliness of human pain?
These questions and more are answered in this personal account of God&#39;s   intervention in one particular family&#39;s life. 
Through overwhelming personal tragedy and anguish, the writer came to know God and developed an intimate relationship with Him. When others in similar circumstances might have turned against God and blamed Him for their trials, she turned to Him for help and solace instead, and He lovingly responded to her each and every prayer. 
While this is the true story of one womans conversion, it is so much more. It is a story of brokenness, and healing, of darkness and light.  But most of all, it is a story of Gods unfathomable love for every human being and His unmistakable desire to walk beside us through every sorrow, holding us up when we can no longer stand ourselves. 
It must be read, not only by people who are suffering difficult trials or personal tragedies, but by every person who seeks to know the true meaning of life. 
Our hearts are restless, O Lord, until they find rest in You.  St Augustine." />
