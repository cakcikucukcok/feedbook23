  <title>God of the Páramo - Matthew L. Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are surrounded by invitations. In grade school, birthday party invitations were so much fun to get in class. Friends may invite us to grab a bite to eat; or you may want to invite that girl from your homeroom to go see a movie. Invitations bring us closer together. Accepting them will always bring us closer to others and teach us more about ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we invite people to share with us, we have to get to know them. The greatest of all invitations came when God sent His Son to offer heaven to mankind. Many dont know this to be true because they feel judged and dont know that the offer is extended to them too.  God is able to invite us because He knows us and wants us to know Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unbelievable adventure started when a young man was invited to leave his country to go to visit a city in Venezuela for one week. Accepting the invitation started an unbelievable course of events and led him to an acceptance of his own spiritual apathy and desolation and a newfound inspiration to overcome it while also reaching out to others. This search for others in desolation continues and has taken the author to incredible heights. He now invites you to share in this compelling journey from near death to abundant life and a lifetime of church planting in the exceptionally beautiful but spiritually dark Andes Mountains.
Half of the royalties from this book will go to support Christ the King Baptist Church in 
Timotes, Venezuela and their ongoing efforts to grow an alcohol rehab center there. &lt;/p&gt;" />
