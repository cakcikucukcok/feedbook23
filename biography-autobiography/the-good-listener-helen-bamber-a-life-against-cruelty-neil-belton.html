  <title>The Good Listener: Helen Bamber: A Life Against Cruelty - Neil Belton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&#39;Essential reading... A horrifying account of the worst that human beings can do to each other. Neil Belton&#39;s synthesis of biography and history is masterly.&#39; Anthony Storr, Sunday Times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helen Bamber went to Belson in 1945 to work with survivors of the  camp. She was just twenty. Since then her life has been involved with  the worst side of the last half-century. In 1985, at the age of sixty,  she set up an organisation devoted to helping victims of torture and to  bearing witness against the fact of torture. This is her story. It is  also a haunting unusual narrative of the post-war world. This 2012 edition offers a new introduction by the author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;The story of Bamber&#39;s life acts as a  framework or prism through which some of the worst events of this  century of horrors are addressed.&#39; Times Literary  Supplement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;[Belton] writes beautifully about an ugly subject... with compassion but also with clarity.&#39; Scotsman&lt;/p&gt;" />
