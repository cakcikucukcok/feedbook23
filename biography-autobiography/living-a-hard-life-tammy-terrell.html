The steps that we must take to fulfill our dreams are nothing to the trials that we must take to fulfill GOD&amp;rsquo;s plan for us in the realm of destiny. This to many may be seen as unreal and in many areas, the happenings are truly my fault but my faith truly was tested but I still and will never turn my back on my GOD and honestly, GOD is still there for us (even when we continue with our own individual human needs, wants, and desires).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James 1:12 Blessed is a man who perseveres under trial; for once he has been approved, he will receive the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
