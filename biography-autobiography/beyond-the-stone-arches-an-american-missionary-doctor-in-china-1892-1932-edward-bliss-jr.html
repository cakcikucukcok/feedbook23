  <title>Beyond the Stone Arches: An American Missionary Doctor in China, 1892-1932 - Edward Bliss, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Advance Praise for Beyond the Stone Arches&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Now the world can share the life of this great man. In its intimate detail, this is a fascinating story that serves as a valuable introduction to the people of a country so important to us today.&quot;-Walter Cronkite&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A fascinating look at China from the point of view of an American medical missionary, this absorbing life of a quiet hero rings with authenticity and sheds light on the turbulent years from the late 1800s to 1932 that will be a revelation for most Western readers.&quot;-Adeline Yen Mah, author of Falling Leaves&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This is a proud man&#39;s story of a father who lived a life of a medical missionary in China for forty years-a life of service, sacrifice, joy, and fulfillment. The pages turn easily and quickly with humor, care, and love. It&#39;s a jewel of a book that will remain with you forever.&quot;-Jim Lehrer, The News Hour&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A small gem. Edward Bliss embarked, against great odds, on a remarkable range of activities aimed at improving the livelihood of common people. He was a veritable one-man Peace Corps. His is an inspiring story that warms the heart and enriches the soul.&quot;-H. T. Huang, author of Science and Civilization in China&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;It took three years for Edward Bliss, M.D., to ascend the Min River in a convoy of three river junks in 1893, averaging fourteen miles a day. This was his first trip to Shaowu, which became his home for forty-two years, a tumultuous and dangerous time and place. His son tells the story of his father&#39;s life and work in fascinating detail, drawing on a trove of letters and extensive interviews with his father.&quot;-Donald MacInnis, former Methodist missionary and China Program Director, National Council of Churches/USA" />
