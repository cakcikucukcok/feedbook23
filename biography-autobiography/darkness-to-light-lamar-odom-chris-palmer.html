  <title>Darkness to Light - Lamar Odom, Chris Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fame. Sex. Pain. Drugs. Death. Booze. Money. Addiction. Redemption. Dizzying heights. Rock bottom depths. Desperation and elation. Sometimes in the same hour. Oh, and don&amp;rsquo;t forget power . . . and the struggle for it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There has never been an athlete quite like Lamar Odom. And there has never been a memoir quite like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world knows him as a two-time NBA world champion who rocketed to uncharted fame few will ever know, thanks to being a member of both the storied 17-time NBA Champion Los Angeles Lakers and the ubiquitous Kardashian empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who is Lamar Odom, really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans have long praised his accessibility, vulnerability, good nature, and genuine everyman quality&amp;mdash;he is a blinding talent who suffers everyday heartache, setback and loss. But until now, his most candid moments have remained behind closed doors . . . sometimes face-down on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his exclusive and revealing memoir &lt;em&gt;Darkness to Light&lt;/em&gt;, Lamar gives an intimate look into his life like never before. In these pages, he recounts the highs and lows of fame and his struggle with his demons as he takes the treacherous path of self-discovery to redemption. From the pain of his unraveled marriage to Khloe Kardashian, to the harmful vices he used to cope, and a low point that made him rethink everything about his life, this is Lamar as you have never before seen him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lamar brings basketball fans directly into the action of a game during the Lakers championship years. He shares his personal account of the lifelong passion that started as one shining light in a childhood marked by loss, which led to international fame as one of the most extraordinary athletes of all time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this profoundly honest book, Lamar invites you to walk with him through the good times and bad, while looking ahead to a brighter future. From his near-death experience to his miraculous return, this Lamar Odom: human being. And his fascinating journey is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;" />
