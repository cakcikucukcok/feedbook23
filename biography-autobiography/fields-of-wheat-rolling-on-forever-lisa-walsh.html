  <title>Fields of Wheat, Rolling on Forever - Lisa Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Family didnt seem to be important when I was a child. It was something we took for granted. When children played, there would be two parents watching, throwing a ball around, joking or sitting around the picnic table. Well, when I was a little child toddling around, what I remember most is my time with my family in Florida: my Mom, my Dad, my sister Chris and my brother Mike. Family to me, at that time, meant having both parents around.
I believe one of our favorite places to go was Clearwater, Florida. My aunt Fran and Uncle Al lived on an outlet of Clearwater Bay, a few blocks away from the Gulf of Mexico. My dad would often take us fishing off my uncles dock. Uncle Al had a boat that we would ride around in as well, and he would let us drive it, but under adult supervision of course! Mom and Aunt Fran would stay back and either clean the fish which we caught (a dirty job nobody wanted) or just watch us having fun. Mom always liked being outdoors near the water.
Along with boating and fishing, we loved looking at the barnacles that attached to the walls around the bay area and around the posts holding up the dock. Mom seemed to be the one most fascinated with these small and disfigured little creatures. She and the rest of us seemed to enjoy watching these creatures just to pass the time of day." />
