  <title>My Basilian Priesthood - Michael Quealey, Jan Rehner, Arthur Haberman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;My Basilian Priesthood&lt;/i&gt; is a memoir of Michael Quealey’s six years in the order in the 1960s. During his priesthood, Quealey was director of the Newman Centre at the University of Toronto and engaged in reforming the mass and in other theological matters. The 1960s was a time of questioning traditions, including the role of Biblical criticism, the nature of liturgy, the place of women in the Church and in society, and the power of community living and decision-making. Quealey was deeply involved in all these matters, and sought to fulfill his commitment to service and balance that with his faith and vows of obedience to the institution of the Church. Written decades after the events he describes, the book is his reflection on the excitement of the times and the tensions created when tradition encountered new ideas and new forms of communal living. Here’s a story that blends Toronto history with Catholic Church history and an inside look at 1960s counterculture." />
