  <title>I Didn’T Know He Wanted More - Leeanne Creech</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leeanne Creechs book I Didnt Know He Wanted More is a great read for those who are seeking to live a more purposeful and meaningful life. Leeanne has a real gift for communication, and her writing keeps you captured through every page. She is honest and real, and through her life story entices us to seek more for our lives through a more intimate relationship with our Creator God, and in our service to others. Leeanne has been awakened to a whole new way of living and looking at life, and she will inspire you to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Pratt, President Orphan Relief and Rescue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed reading Leeannes refreshing and delightful story of how her adventures in Africa changed her life. A fun book to read with your morning coffee or at night before you fall asleep. Who knows? You, too, may find your heart tugged to help the the ministry of Orphan Relief and Rescue in some way that truly makes a difference!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda J. MacDonald, M.S., Marriage and Family Therapist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author, How to Help Your Spouse Heal from Your Affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us that know Jesus, daily, each of us has the opportunity to live in obedience to Him. In this book, Leeanne Creech chronicles her journey to and through obedience where Jesus cultivates deep within her a passion for deeper relationship with Him by serving those in great need.&lt;/p&gt;
