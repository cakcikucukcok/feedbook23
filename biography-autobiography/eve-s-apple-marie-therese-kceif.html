  <title>Eve’S Apple - Marie Therese Kceif</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Witness of Gods Faithfulness &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marie struggles to grow in grace and guidance from the Lord while slowly recognizing her own rebellion. She intimately shows us the highs of her aviation and automotive careers and the suffering lows of abuse, bankruptcy, and divorce. Her relationship with God grows through it all. Eves Apple is a witness of how God gently guides one of His Eves into a slow freeing surrender of a Marys trusting yes. This is a journey of hope, faith, and real relationship! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph A. Marsigla, COL, MS, Commander, US Army: Some words that come to mind are warm, introspective, wonderment, I could go on and on. The talent God has given her has allowed me to look at my life, to look at things I have not thought of in some time. I see many parallels and similar struggles. This book is one of those rare jewels that can change lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father David Harvey, Senior Catholic Priest: An able storyteller and an adept communicator. She speaks with conviction and grace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jill Savage, Hearts at Home founder and CEO: She has a story to tell, and she tells it well. Shes honest and open about the less-than-charming part of her story. Most important, however, she is candid and sincere about the work God has done in her life. Our moms were touched by her story, and I know you will be, too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
