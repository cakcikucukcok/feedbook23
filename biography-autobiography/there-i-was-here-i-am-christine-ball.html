  <title>There I Was: Here I Am - Christine Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I started to write this book during a time when my mind and body were at its weakest, when I could only live from one hour to the next. I was living with addictions and the pain and trauma that no mother should have to endure after the tragic and sudden loss of my beautiful son, Naylor. It was self-help that started me on a journey to recovery, and eventually I learned to channel my mind, body, and soul.
This book also gives an insight to the life of a little boy growing into a man while battling grief for his father and struggling to live his dream.
I wrote this book from my heart. I relived every word, and it wasnt easy. I am from the Romany culture, and so I found it hard to put my private life in black and white for everyone to read, but doing this has enabled me to help so many others. My book is raw but honest, and I know that it will help anyone who is also going through unbearable emotional pain to know that they are never alone." />
