  <title>The Strange Works of Taro Yoko - Nicolas Turcev</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Throughout his career, Taro Yoko was despaired by the image of humanity returned by most big budget video games.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taro Yoko&#39;s strange work&lt;/i&gt; reviews the entire career of this extraordinary creator, his games (Drakengard, NieR) and sheds light on the link that constitutes his work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Check out this complete book on Taro Yoko, which explores the contours of its games, their development, the complexity of their stories and their thematic depth. With a preface by Taro Yoko himself !&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXTRACT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nowadays, most of the players who have heard of Taro Yoko do not associate his name to any particular face. Inconvenienced by public appearances, the director systematically equipped himself with a device to cover his face during meetings with the press, at least since the creation of NieR. Shortly before the announcement of NieR: Automata at the E3 2015, Yoko even had a mask made, based on the character Emil, by a plastic artist from PlatinumGames for a mere four hundred euros. Since then, he has worn it every time he is in the presence of photo and video cameras. His persistence in hiding his face under this thick layer of plastic naturally arouses curiosity. One might be led to believe that this is a communication strategy or the eccentricity of an enigmatic creator. Nevertheless, the visual anonymity of the director is in no way a means to nurture the mystery of his personality. Far from comparing himself to the likes of Banksy (a famous street artist and statement maker, who prefers to remain anonymous), Yoko just prefers to let his games speak for themselves. In fact, ask him, and he will answer with no difficulty that he grew up in Nagoya, in the Japanese prefecture of Aichi. Restaurant managers (izakayas, ramens, tempuras, etc.), his parents flitted from one restaurant opening to the next and entrusted their son’s education to his grandmother.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WHAT CRITICS THINK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, I enjoyed my time with &lt;i&gt;The Strange Works of Taro Yoko&lt;/i&gt;, especially as a fan of the man’s works [...] It’s a great companion piece for long-time fans, and if you’re looking for more unofficial content to read about for the Drakenier universe, you can’t go too wrong. - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;RPG Site&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nicolas Turcev&lt;/b&gt; - Journalist specialized in pop culture, he has contributed to the following magazines: &lt;i&gt;Chronic’Art&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Carbone&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Games&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gamekult&lt;/i&gt;, and occasionally participates in the video game analysis site &lt;i&gt;Merlanfrit&lt;/i&gt;.
