  <title>The Story of a Prolific Inventor: Thomas Edison - Alfred Mayer, George Shaw, Elbert Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book deals with the story of Thomas Edison. This remarkable inventor, of whom the public has heard so much, was born in 1847 at the little village of Milan, Ohio. His mother was of Scotch parentage, but born in Massachusetts; she was finely educated, literary and ambitious, and had been a teacher in Canada. Young Edison&#39;s only schooling came from his mother, who taught him spelling, reading, writing, and arithmetic. He lost his mother in 1862, but his father, a man of vigorous constitution, is still living, aged seventy-four. When he was seven years old, his parents removed to Port Huron, Michigan. The boy disliked mathematics, but was fond of reading, and, before he was twelve years old, had read the &quot;Penny Cyclopædia,&quot; Hume&#39;s &quot;England,&quot; and Gibbon&#39;s &quot;Rome.&quot; He early took to the railroad, and became a newsboy on the Grand Trunk line, running into Detroit. Here he had access to a library, which he undertook to read through; but, after skimming over many hundred miscellaneous books, he adopted the plan of select reading on subjects of interest to him...  &lt;/p&gt;" />
