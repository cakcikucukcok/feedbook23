  <title>A Life Less Ordinary - Baby Halder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When she was very young, Baby Halder was abandoned by her mother and left with a cruel, abusive father. She was married off at twelve to a man twice her age who beat her. At fourteen, she was a mother herself. Her early life was marked by overwhelming challenges and heartbreak until, exhausted and desperate, she fled with her three children to Delhi, to work as a maid in some of the city&#39;s wealthiest homes. Expected to serve her employers&#39; every demand, she faced a staggering workload that often left her no time to care for her own children. But she never complained, for such is the lot of the poor in modern-day India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written without a trace of self-pity, &lt;em&gt;A Life Less Ordinary&lt;/em&gt; is a shocking look deep inside a world of poverty and subjugation that few outsiders know about&amp;#8212;and an inspiring true story of one remarkable woman&#39;s strength, courage, and determination to soar above her circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;" />
