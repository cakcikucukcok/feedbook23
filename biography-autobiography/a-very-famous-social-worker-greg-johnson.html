  <title>A Very Famous Social Worker - Greg Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Greg Johnson was interviewing for a job at a mental health center his interview was interrupted by a police officer with a naked woman in tow. I was looking for an adventure, he says, and this looked like it.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In A Very Famous Social Worker&lt;/i&gt; the author recounts with insight and humor his experiences as a rookie social worker in West Virginias Greenbrier Valley. His unlikely parade of clients include a preacher whose wildly rebellious children are threatening to bring down his ministry, a teenage underwear fetishist, a man obsessed with Dolly Parton, and a schizophrenic poet. He goes the extra mile, often literally, teaching a client to drive, transporting an inebriated musician to rehab, and navigating a winding country road with a three-tiered wedding cake.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Engaging and entertaining, &lt;i&gt;A Very Famous Social Worker&lt;/i&gt; sheds light on a profession practiced by 600,000 Americans that remains little known to the general public.&lt;/p&gt;" />
