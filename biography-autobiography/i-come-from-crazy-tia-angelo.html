  <title>I Come from Crazy - Tia Angelo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this moving memoir, Tia Angelo takes us on her crazy journey growing up in Staten Island and Brooklyn, New York, with her incredibly dysfunctional family. Living with a mother suffering from alcoholism and prescription drug addiction, having an absentee father, and struggling to cope with the circumstances at home, Tia and her sister were shuttled between aunts, grandparents, and other relatives for most of their childhood. With a mom too sick to care for her children and often hospitalized, Tia witnessed firsthand the effects of addiction and the emotional scars it leaves behind. Hungry for stability, she finds refuge with her girlfriends and their families, spending most of her time in their homes and seeking solace as she navigates her crazy family life. Tia shows us how her desire for normalcy and happiness leads her to explore her inner conflict created by her family of origin. Throughout her journey of self-exploration, Tia has triumphed, coming out stronger and more determined to share her experiences with the hopes to help others find their path.
With love, courage, forgiveness, and a bit of WTF?, Tia shares her crazy family stories as well as her journey in turning her life around and finding her rainbow in what she calls a life of storms.
Tia is available for book clubs, select readings, and lectures. You can contact her at iamtiaangelo@gmail.com" />
