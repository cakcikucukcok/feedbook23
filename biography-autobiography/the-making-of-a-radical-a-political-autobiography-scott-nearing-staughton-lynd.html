  <title>The Making of a Radical: A Political Autobiography - Scott Nearing, Staughton Lynd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Scott Nearing lived one hundred years, from 1883 to 1983--a life spanning most of the twentieth century. In his early years, Nearing made his name as a formidable opponent of child labor and military imperialism. Having been fired from university jobs for his independence of mind, Nearing became a freelance lecturer and writer, traveling widely through Depression-era and post-war America to speak with eager audiences. Five-time Socialist candidate for president Eugene V. Debs said, &quot;Scott Nearing! He is the greatest teacher in the United States.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Concluding that it would be better to be poor in the country than in New York City, Scott and Helen Nearing moved north to Vermont in 1932 and commenced the experiment in self-reliant living that would extend their fame far and wide. They began to grow most of their own food, and devised their famous scheme for allocating the day&#39;s hours: one third for &quot;bread work&quot; (livelihood), one third for &quot;head work&quot; (intellectual endeavors), and one third for &quot;service to the world community.&quot; Scott (who&#39;d grown up partly on his grandfather&#39;s Pennsylvania farm) taught Helen (who was raised in suburbia, groomed for a career as a classical violinist) the practical skills they would need: working with tools, cultivating a garden and managing a woodlot, and building stone and masonry walls.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For the rest of their lives, the Nearings chronicled in detail their &quot;good life,&quot; first in Vermont and ultimately on the coast of Maine, in a group of wonderful books--many of which are now being returned to print by Chelsea Green in cooperation with the Good Life Center, an educational trust established at the Nearings&#39; Forest Farm in Harborside, Maine, to promote their ongoing legacy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With a new foreword by activist historian Staughton Lynd, &lt;em&gt;The Making of a Radical&lt;/em&gt; is freshly republished-Scott Nearing&#39;s own story, told as only he could tell it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
