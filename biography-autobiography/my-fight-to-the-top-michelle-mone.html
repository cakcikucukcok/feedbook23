  <title>My Fight to the Top - Michelle Mone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Michelle Mone is one of the most successful businesswomen of her generation. An inspiration for entrepreneurs the world over, Michelle overcame hardship and a difficult childhood to become one of the most lucrative and creative executives in business circles across the globe.&lt;br&gt;   Her journey to the top, however, hasn&amp;#8217;t been easy. Born in the east end of Glasgow, Michelle left school at the age of 15 to look after her father after illness left him confined to a wheelchair. Returning to work briefly as a model and then as Head of Sales at Labatt Brewers, Michelle was always thinking creatively and looking for opportunities to channel her entrepreneurial spirit. But it wasn&amp;#8217;t until she was made redundant from her job at Labatts that Michelle came up with an idea that would change not only her life but also enhance the lives of millions of women around the world.&lt;br&gt;   Ultimo &amp;#150; the quality-crafted, cleavage-enhancing lingerie &amp;#150; was founded by Michelle in 1996 and has gone on to become one of the biggest and innovative brands in the fashion industry. Its founder is now amongst the most respected businesswoman in the world and one of the most sought-after speakers on business and feminist issues. From overcoming near-poverty on the rough streets of Glasgow, to developing the Ultimo brand into the foremost accessory for women, gaining an OBE and bringing up three children whilst going through a tumultuous divorce, My Fight to the Top is a wonderful tale of how an enterprising spirit, pure ambition and savvy know-how combined to create the UK&amp;#8217;s most successful fashion brand.&lt;br&gt;   &amp;#160;&lt;/div&gt;" />
