  <title>24 - John Shea, Willie Mays, Bob Costas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE INSTANT &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The legendary Willie Mays shares the inspirations and influences responsible for guiding him on and off the field in this reflective and inspirational memoir.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Even if, like me, you thought you had pretty much read and heard all there was to read and hear about Willie Mays, this warmhearted book will inform and reward you. And besides, what true baseball fan can ever get enough of Willie Mays? Say Hey! Read on and enjoy.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;  &lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the Foreword by Bob Costas  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;It&#39;s because of giants like Willie that someone like me could even think about running for President.&quot; --President Barack Obama&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Widely regarded as the greatest all-around player in baseball history because of his unparalleled hitting, defense and baserunning, the beloved Willie Mays offers people of all ages his lifetime of experience meeting challenges with positivity, integrity and triumph in &lt;i&gt;24: Life Stories and Lessons from the Say Hey Kid.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Presented in 24 chapters to correspond with his universally recognized uniform number, Willie&#39;s memoir provides more than the story of his role in America&#39;s pastime. This is the story of a man who values family and community, engages in charitable causes especially involving children and follows a philosophy that encourages hope, hard work and the fulfillment of dreams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;I was very lucky when I was a child. My family took care of me and made sure I was in early at night. I didn&#39;t get in trouble. My father made sure that I didn&#39;t do the wrong thing. I&#39;ve always had a special place in my heart for children and their well-being, and John Shea and I got the idea that we should do something for the kids and the fathers and the mothers, and that&#39;s why this book is being published. We want to reach out to all generations and backgrounds. Hopefully, these stories and lessons will inspire people in a positive way.&quot; --Willie Mays&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
