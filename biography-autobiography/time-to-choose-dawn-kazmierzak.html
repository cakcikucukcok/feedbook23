  <title>Time to Choose - Dawn Kazmierzak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hilda Gutwein, the youngest of eight children born to a German farmer, grew up in a war zone--the Balkan States. Her family lived under socialism, communism, and Hitlers Third Reich. Eventually, they were caught between two totalitarian forms of government, and Hildas father had to make a choice for his family: stay and defend their homeland or leave everything behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow the story of Hildas journey from a land controlled by fear and brutality to a land of freedom. Moreover, its an account of unwavering faith in the One who is trustworthy and unchanging no matter what comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through Hildas accounts, youll gain insights about:&lt;/p&gt;
A culture headed to the default of a dictator, monarch, or centralized power
How propaganda instills fear and a need for government protection
The true role and abilities of government
How censorship, deceptive concepts, and false ideologies can spread through media
Why freedom is prized by most of the worlds citizenry but is rarely obtained.
&lt;p&gt;Beyond an inspiring account, each chapter ends with a Connecting the Dots section in which you and your family can begin to think about it, transmit your values, and formulate your own plans to mind the minds, souls, and virtues of your children, your community, and your nation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In light of the climate of your country today, where will you look for your familys future? The time is now. Its your turn to choose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
