  <title>What&#39;s Up With Ros?: Me, myself and Tommy Sheridan - Ros Nash, Rab Egerton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever wondered what life is like on a psychiatric ward? Or what it feels like to lose your mind? &#39;What&#39;s Up With Ros?&#39; gives you the chance to see something of this hidden, chaotic world. 34-year-old magazine editor Ros Nash had always been an insomniac, but in December 2010 her sleep deprivation went too far - she was sectioned and spent three weeks on a psychiatric ward in Glasgow. Written in a year-in-the-life diary style, &#39;What&#39;s Up With Ros?&#39; chronicles not just those three weeks locked up, but the next stage in her life too. Using humour more often than self-analysis, it shows how she learned to start accepting the past, reflecting on her problems whilst on a road trip across Europe with her husband Rob. Written entirely without self-pity, this shocking and extraordinary true story will make you laugh and cry. If you&#39;ve ever let stress or office politics get the better of you, if you&#39;ve ever worked so hard you burned out, if you&#39;ve ever dreamed of leaving the rat race behind for good, you&#39;ll love this book." />
