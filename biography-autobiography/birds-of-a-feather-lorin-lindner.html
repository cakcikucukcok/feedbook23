  <title>Birds of a Feather - Lorin Lindner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;This true story will twist your heart like a sponge and renew your faith in the world.&quot; --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lee Woodruff&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;, co-author with Bob Woodruff of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller &lt;i&gt;In an Instant&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A heartwarming book.&quot; --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vicki Myron,  author of &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; #1 Bestseller &lt;i&gt;Dewey&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Reminds us of the extraordinary ways caring people are helping the men and women who have served our country...and animals along with them.&quot; --Maxine Waters &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;I defy anyone to read it without shedding tears.&quot; --Rosemary Low, author of &lt;i&gt;The Complete Book of Parrots&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;It left me smiling, full of hope, and wishing there were more Lorin Linders out there.&quot; --Mary Gauthier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal lover though she was, Lorin Lindner was definitely not looking for a pet. Then came Sammy - a mischievous and extremely loud bright pink Moluccan cockatoo who had been abandoned. It was love at first sight. But Sammy needed a companion. Enter Mango, lover of humans (&quot;Hewwo&quot;), inveterate thief of precious objects. Realizing that there were many parrots in need of new homes, Dr. Lindner eventually founded a sanctuary for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, she began to meet homeless veterans on the streets of Los Angeles. Before long she was a full time advocate for these former service members, who were often suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ultimately, Dr. Lindner created a program for them, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually the two parts of her life came together when she founded Serenity Park, a unique sanctuary on the grounds of the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Administration Healthcare Center. She had noticed that the veterans she treated as a clinical psychologist and the parrots she had taken in as a rescuer quickly formed bonds. Men and women who had been silent in therapy would share their stories and their feelings more easily with animals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Birds of a Feather&lt;/i&gt; is ultimately a love story between veterans and the birds they nurse back to health and between Dr. Lindner and her husband, a veteran with PTSD, who healed at Serenity Park. Full of remarkable people and colorful birds, this book reminds us that we all have the power to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;" />
