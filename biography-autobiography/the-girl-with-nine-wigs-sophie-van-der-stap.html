  <title>The Girl With Nine Wigs - Sophie van der Stap</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#39;It&#39;s Saturday and everything is different. No, I didn&#39;t go to the market this morning and I didn&#39;t have my usual coffee on Westerstraat.  And no, I wasn&#39;t getting ready for a new semester at college. Next Monday, January 31st, I have to admit myself at the hospital for my first chemotherapy session. For the next two months, I&#39;m expected each week for a fresh shot of vincristine, etoposide, ifosfamide and loads more exciting abracadabra.&#39;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Sophie is twenty-one when she is diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of cancer. A striking, fun-loving student, her world is reduced overnight to the sterile confines of a hospital. But within these walls Sophie discovers a whole new world of white coats, gossiping nurses, and sexy doctors; of shared rooms, hair loss, and eyebrow pencils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As wigs become a crucial part of Sophie&#39;s new life, she reclaims a sense of self-expression. Each of Sophie&#39;s nine wigs makes her feel stronger and gives her a distinct personality, and that is why each has its own name: Stella, Sue, Daisy, Blondie, Platina, Uma, Pam, Lydia, and Bebé. There&#39;s a bit of Sophie in all of them, and they reveal as much as they hide. Sophie is determined to be much more than a cancer patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With refreshing candor and a keen eye for the absurd, Sophie van der Stap&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Girl With Nine Wigs&lt;/i&gt; makes you smile when you least expect it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
