  <title>A Widow’S Might - Kathryn Bolser Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;West Chester, in Southwest Ohio, was a small rural community in 1922, when Olive Naomi Jackson and Joseph Franklin Bolser married. He was the youngest of six sons, and she was reared as an only child after the death of her&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;sister in infancy. Both grew up on farms, and when they married, it was natural they would work together to establish a dairy herd and build a farming operation of their own. Their family grew as goals were accomplished, but life took some unexpected twists and turns. Perseverance, endurance, and faith played major roles in the survival of their family.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1928, Olive, now a young mother of three, faces challenges when Joe dies unexpectedly. Keeping the family together in the face of tragedy is made more difficult by limited job opportunities for women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Widows Might, by author Kathryn Bolser Banks, narrates the life experiences of her paternal grandmother who had a gift for remembering details about everyday life and including them in her recollections of days gone by. Memories, notes, and diaries all contributed to the story of how one woman overcame the odds to save herself and preserve her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This memoir shares the joys and challenges of life in a bygone era while illuminating timeless lessons about family ties. It highlights how devotion and determination translate into actions that bind people together through difficult situations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
