  <title>Delightfully Terrible - Allen L. Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I know God still speaks to His children today. He has spoken in the past, He still speaks today, and will continue speaking in the future to anyone. Throughout my Christian life, God has spoken to me. He speaks through His Word, His Holy Spirits gifts of utterance, preachers/teachers, dreams, my spouse and friends, through songs and music, subtle impulses, and through dramatic experiences. Once He has my attention, He will do everything necessary to impress upon my spirit the things He wants to teach me. Next to learning how to recognize His voice, the recurring theme has been that He is teaching me the importance of obedience! He wants me to stop and  wait upon the Lord. Next, He wants me to listen to what He is saying to say to me, because,  my sheep know my voice He wants me to follow Him since He [already] knows the way that I take And finally, He asks me to be faithful and obedient because  For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; Every mans work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every mans work of what sort it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Submit your life to Jesus Christ, and allow Him to be your Lord. He will speak His will for your life in clear, undeniable ways.&lt;/p&gt;" />
