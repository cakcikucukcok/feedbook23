  <title>On the Way Out - Jack McCall, Alan Clement</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack McCall&lt;/b&gt; was born to be a priest because his father wanted it so badly. &lt;b&gt;Alan Clement&lt;/b&gt; was born a Catholic because his mother was one. In &lt;b&gt;On the Way Out,&lt;/b&gt; two elderly men from two starkly different walks of life share a years worth of humorous, insightful conversations as they discuss things that matter and reflect on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jack McCall&lt;/b&gt; was a Jesuit priest for thirty years and then a married man for thirty more. His friend &lt;b&gt;Alan Clement&lt;/b&gt; lived through loss of a business; the joys of marriage, family, relationships; and the discovery of self-worth. As they share transcripts from their conversations in a retirement home that detail their experiences from a combined more than one hundred and sixty years of life, it is evident that neither had a smooth journey as each faced his share of disappointments, losses, and struggles. Yet as their lively conversations reveal, both eventually discovered resilience and the will to live a rewarding life, despite facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;On the Way Out&lt;/b&gt; is an inspirational compilation of insightful exchanges of wisdom and humor from two men from different sides of the tracks who, through their diverse experiences, ultimately learned to embrace happiness, faith, and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
