  <title>Memories of a Swing Maker - Rhadames De Leon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Of the many books I have read, none has impressed me so much as this one. Its chapters are impressing; the graphic and objective stories about the experience of the author as a correction officer for the state of NY, make him worthy of the most demanding reader, especially, those agents in the service of law and order. The author describes amazing, as well as interesting anecdotes of inmates. They are anecdotes worthy of historical value for their realism and accuracy. These stories will be an excellent material for the scholars of sociology and human behavior. 
Dorian Polanco
I recommend this work to any agent of the law; likewise, to any other reader who will enjoy its descriptive content. Ray Deleon extracts from his prodigious mind, reminiscent events that have been treasured in his memories for decades which he relates unreservedly. They are wonderful descriptions of his life experience in the prisons he has worked as a correctional officer, that will leave the avid reader thirsty for the spectacular narrative.
Dr. Alvin Bridgewater
Without proposing it, by the excellence and realism of its content Memories of a Swing Maker is an inexhaustible source for radio and television series. One does not have to be so genial to peruse chapters and scenes of this work in dozens of exciting episodes, for this in one of the most faithful portraits of our daily life, worthy of being noted as a route letter and procedural manual for those who emigrate to USA, hopeful in reaching the great American Dream.

Some had to leave. Others wanted to leave. Rhadams had an anxiety to leave. He believed that in the USA he could make his dreams come true. He benefited from the opportunities; he was worthy of them, responding as an exemplary citizen. This is the story of the realization of his dream: The American Dream.
