  <title>For Blessing or for Destruction - Abigail Skyz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Abby never dreamed she would not be the one to finish raising her children. After all she was the one who had the encounter with Jesus Christ that changed her life forever.  How did this happen, where did she go wrong? The reader will explore the aftermath from Abbys personal experiences as she walked through the floods that ravaged her home and how she survived to tell about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had this book been available in 1977, Abby would have bought it. It would have been a source to help open her eyes on the importance of identifying and healing her own past childhood hurts in order to become healthy emotionally and empowered to stay away from unhealthy abusive men. Abby would have learned how to proactively help her children, guiding them on the road to healthy, happy productive lives from the start.
It is a delicate and awkward subject discussing an abusive marriage that entails child sexual abuse and the horrific after effects of such abuse. Could it be that God called Abby into His kingdom for such a time as this? &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Former co-host of the 700 Club Sheila Walsh, wrote a book titled Honestly, that book was a key factor in helping Abby to face and process her own past childhood trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I can say is WOW this is as much a self-help book as it is a Memoir. Donna Vigil R.N.&lt;/p&gt;" />
