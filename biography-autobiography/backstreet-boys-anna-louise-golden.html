  <title>Backstreet Boys - Anna Louise Golden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When they say &lt;i&gt;Quit Playing Games With My Heart, &lt;/i&gt;you better listen-- &#39;cause they&#39;re the Backstreet Boys, one of the hottest boy-bands ever to take the stage. These five ultra-fine guys have won the hearts of millions. So step back into their awesome world and see what made them tick at this exciting, early stage of their careers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An insider&#39;s look back at the band: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howie Dorough was the peacemaker of the group. But watch out-this flirtatious hunk was also known as the &quot;Latin lover.&quot; Kevin Richardson, as the group&#39;s gorgeous oldest member, sometimes had to be the responsible one. Nick Carter, the band&#39;s youngest member, wasn&#39;t called &quot;Chaos&quot; for nothing-- this blond-haired, blue-eyed cutie was a major prankster! Brian Littrell, a big-time hottie, was the comedian of the bunch-- Jim Carrey was his idol, and he loved to play practical jokes. AJ McLean, deeply romantic-- he wrote the band&#39;s love ballads, and this sexy songster was rarely seen without his trademark sunglasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fall in love all over again with the Backstreet Boys as they celebrate more than twenty years of top-charting success.&lt;/p&gt;" />
