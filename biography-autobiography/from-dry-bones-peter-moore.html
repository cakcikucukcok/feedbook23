  <title>From Dry Bones - Peter Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A friend writes
HERE IS THE MEMOIR of a man who, more than any other, has promoted the witness of classical Anglican Evangelicalism in Episcopal Church.  It is his personal faith journey, written with remarkable candor and sensitivity about the people and culture that shaped him: his parents and family, childhood experiences of gospel teaching; his education at St. Marks School, Yale University and Oxford and the spiritual challenges of growing up with material privilege in sophisticated society.
Here you will read of his experience of Billy Graham, his meeting John Scott and Eric Nash, the eccentric clergyman who started intensive Christian groups throughout English Public Schools, feeding solidly biblically orthodox young man into every corner of British life. This was the model that was to fire his vision of an American expression- Fellowship of Christians in Universities and Schools- and helped lead him to become a foremost apologist for the credibility and power of the biblical worldview. Here you will also read of his marriage to Sandra Clark and of their children.
There are so many of us who are greatly indebted to Pter Moore who continues to inspire the faithful leadership that is redeeming the American Church.
