  <title>Second Platoon: Call Sign Hades - First Lieutenant Mark A. Bodrog</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The war in Afghanistan is considered by most to be Americas longest and least talked about war to date. After terrorists attacked the United States on 9/11, less than one percent of Americas population answered our nations call to serve in the Armed Forces. Even fewer Americans made the life choice to become United States Marines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this war, two Marine Corps platoons were selected by their Battalion to fully integrate with two platoons of Afghanistan National Army Soldiers in order to create a Combined Action Company (CAC) capable of conducting sustained Counterinsurgency (COIN) operations throughout their Area of Operations (AO) and adjacent battlespaces. Inside of this book, you will learn about one of those platoons and how they fought the Taliban during their deployment to the Helmand Province, Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, Bodrog recalls how his platoon of Marines, Sailors and Afghan Soldiers lived, operated and fought in the Helmand Province, Afghanistan as part of the Combined Action Company. In doing so and translucently through the men under his command, the author attempts to immortalize every Marine, servicemen and civilian who sacrificed everything they had to ensure the survival of our great nation, while asking for nothing in return. The missions and stories mentioned in this memoir must never be forgotten or become a lost chapter in our nations history.&lt;br /&gt;Discover what its like to be one of the bold few who still fight for freedom and gain a deeper appreciation of the Marines and Sailors who served this great nation with Second Platoon: Call Sign Hades.&lt;/p&gt;" />
