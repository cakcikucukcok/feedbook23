  <title>The Projects - Olmon Hairston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Olmon Hairston, has written The Projects (The Harlem I Remember Through The Eyes of a Child and Young Man). This story involves growing up in the St. Nicholas housing projects in Harlem, New York, during the 1950s and 60s. He believes that the projects, despite negative connotations, can serve as a foundation for residents to develop a sense of upward mobility. 
Olmon is committed to helping inner-city youth and all students realize that goals are attainable. When he was assigned as a counselor to several leading upper-middle class schools in Queens with small minority populations, Olmon demonstrated the ability to work with all students, despite their race or social status. Although Olmon didn&#39;t realize it at the time, but these students were replicating his teenage experience with their parents, who understood the importance of navigating the educational system to ensure that their children received a quality education. For years Olmon was the only professional educator of color (male or female) who was a counselor in predominantly white schools, but he never lost his sense of who he was or what purpose he served to all students. He consistently received accolades from administrators, parents, students, colleagues, and supervisors. 
Olmon was one of several full-time supervisors who managed a school-based counseling program that focused on providing services that specifically addressed issues related to drug and alcohol prevention/intervention and other areas e.g. bullying, developing positive self-esteem and making smart choices. After acquiring the required educational credentials and related experience, Olmon obtained his New York State Education Department Certification as SAS (School Administrator and Supervisor), SDL (School District Leader) and SBL (School Building Leader), which qualified him for school leadership positions such as principal, assistant principal, superintedent and education administrator. employed." />
