  <title>Where the Light Enters - Jill Biden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An intimate look at the love that built the Biden family and the delicate balancing act of the woman at its center&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;How did you get this number?&quot; Those were the first words Jill Biden spoke to U.S. senator Joe Biden when he called her out of the blue to ask her on a date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Growing up, Jill had wanted two things: a marriage like her parents&#39;--strong, loving, and full of laughter--and a career. An early heartbreak had left her uncertain about love, until she met Joe. But as they grew closer, Jill faced difficult questions: How would politics shape her family and professional life? And was she ready to become a mother to Joe&#39;s two young sons?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She soon found herself falling in love with her three &quot;boys,&quot; learning to balance life as a mother, wife, educator, and political spouse. Through the challenges of public scrutiny, complicated family dynamics, and personal losses, she grew alongside her family, and she extended the family circle at every turn: with her students, military families, friends and staff at the White House, and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the story of how Jill built a family--and a life--of her own. From the pranks she played to keep everyone laughing to the traditions she formed that would carry them through tragedy, hers is the spirited journey of a woman embracing many roles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where the Light Enters&lt;/i&gt; is a candid, heartwarming glimpse into the creation of a beloved American family, and the life of a woman at its center.&lt;/p&gt;" />
