  <title>Unprocessed - Megan Kimble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the tradition of Michael Pollan&amp;#8217;s bestselling&lt;em&gt; In Defense of Food &lt;/em&gt;comes this remarkable chronicle, from a founding editor of &lt;em&gt;Edible Baja Arizona&lt;/em&gt;, of a young woman&amp;#8217;s year-long journey of eating only whole, unprocessed foods&amp;#8212;intertwined with a journalistic exploration of what &amp;#8220;unprocessed&amp;#8221; really means, why it matters, and how to afford it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January of 2012, Megan Kimble was a twenty-six-year-old living in a small apartment without even a garden plot to her name. But she cared about where food came from, how it was made, and what it did to her body: so she decided to go an entire year without eating processed foods. &lt;em&gt;Unprocessed &lt;/em&gt;is the narrative of Megan&amp;#8217;s extraordinary year, in which she milled wheat, extracted salt from the sea, milked a goat, slaughtered a sheep, and more&amp;#8212;all while earning an income that fell well below the federal poverty line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes a food processed? As Megan would soon realize, the answer to that question went far beyond cutting out snacks and sodas, and became a fascinating journey through America&amp;#8217;s food system, past and present. She learned how wheat became white; how fresh produce was globalized and animals industrialized. But she also discovered that in daily life, as she attempted to balance her project with a normal social life&amp;#8212;which included dating&amp;#8212;the question of what made a food processed was inextricably tied to gender and economy, politics and money, work and play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Backed by extensive research and wide-ranging interviews&amp;#8212;and including tips on how to ditch processed food and transition to a real-food lifestyle&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Unprocessed&lt;/em&gt; offers provocative insights not only on the process of food, but also the processes that shape our habits, communities, and day-to-day lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
