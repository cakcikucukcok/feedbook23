  <title>Through the Eyes of a Child - Anne Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THROUGH THE EYES OF A CHILD is a true story of how I understood
my life as a child and some of the decisions and consequences that followed as an adult due to the lack of parental guidance, love, and the feeling of being accepted as an OK person. I am a true believer that if God had not shown
up in my life when He did and had not intervened, I and my two children would not be alive today. I was born in East Texas in Marshall in 1947 and was the oldest of three children born to my parents. We were children from the first marriage. Later my dad married seven more times and my mom eight more times, marrying the same man twice. As I talk about the path of
life that I followed, you can understand as a reader how the dysfunctional childhood played a large part in my life. Along with the dysfunction was a mixture of physical abuse &amp; neglect, abandonment, domestic violence, alcoholism, and poverty. The first book that my sister, Mary King, wrote and
I contributed is titled NO POT, NO WINDOW. She and I collaborated on the past memories in her book as well as her writing of her decisions and consequences in life. She joined the military and later retired after 21 years of active duty service as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy. I retired
this year from the work force with the State of Texas and have built a cabin in the mountains of south east Oklahoma where I currently reside, single, with my two Chihuahuas, Yo Quiero and Little Man. My two children are married and live with their families in the Dallas, Ft. Worth area of Texas.
I have a total of six grandchildren." />
