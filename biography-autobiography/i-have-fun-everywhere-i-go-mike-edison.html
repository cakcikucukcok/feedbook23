An Ivy League dropout who&#39;s never looked back, Edison embarked on a career that&#39;s landed him in the producer&#39;s chair for one of the worst B movies of all time; on tour with the likes of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, GG Allin, and the Ramones; undercover at a religious cult; on a bender with Evel Knievel; feuding with Hulk Hogan; smoking dope with Ozzy Osborne; and authoring some twenty novels you wouldn&#39;t want your mother to catch you reading--let alone writing. As the publisher of &lt;i&gt;High Times&lt;/i&gt;, he battled almost daily with a rainbow brigade of unrepentant hippies plagued with short-term memory loss, and owners who treated their employees more like the tenants of a halfway house for potheads than a team of professional editors and writers, all while leading the magazine to record heights in sales and advertising. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Have Fun Everywhere I Go &lt;/i&gt;combines the fear and loathing of Hunter Thompson&#39;s journalistic thrill rides with the acerbic insider voice of Toby Young.
