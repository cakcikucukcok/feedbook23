  <title>A Rebel in Gaza - Asmaa al-Ghoul, Sélim Nassib, Mike Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Asmaa al-Ghoul is a Palestinian journalist, now exiled in France, who grew up in the Rafah refugee camp in Gaza. Her book offers a rare view of a young woman coming into her own political and secular beliefs amidst the region’s relentless violence. She has been called “too strong minded,” frequently criticized for not covering her hair and for being outspoken. As a journalist and activist, she has led demonstrations and been vocal in her opposition to Hamas and Fatah, which has led her to family strife, imprisonment, brutal interrogations, death threats and attacks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Rebel in Gaza&lt;/i&gt; is Asmaa’s story as told to Franco-Lebanese writer Selim Nassib over meetings, phone calls, Skype, and even texts during the 2014 siege of Gaza, when she was locked in the “open air prison” that her homeland had become. Both determined and dedicated to its liberation through writing, education and culture, she paints the sensory portrait of the native country she passionately loves, which over years has become a cauldron of wars and fundamentalism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gaza has always been rebellious . . .  stubborn, addictive, I&#39;m her daughter and I look like her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Asmaa al-Ghoul&lt;/b&gt; (b. 1982) was given the prestigious Courage in Journalism Award by the International Women’s Media Foundation and is described by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; as a woman “known for her defiant stance against the violations of civil rights in Gaza.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Selim Nassib&lt;/b&gt; (b. 1946), journalist for &lt;i&gt;Libération&lt;/i&gt; and novelist is the author of &lt;i&gt;Oum&lt;/i&gt; (Balland) and &lt;i&gt;A Lover in Palestine&lt;/i&gt; (Robert Laffont), both published in translation by Europa Editions." />
