  <title>City of Secrets - John Follain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the night of Monday, May 4, 1998, in Vatican territory, the bodies of the commander of the Swiss Guard, his wife, and a young lance corporal were found in the barracks of the picturesque force entrusted with protecting the pope. It was the worst bloodbath to take place in more than a century in the heart of the supreme authority of the world&#39;s one billion Catholics. Four hours later, the Vatican announced that the lance corporal, twenty-three-year-old C&amp;#233;dric Tornay, had shot the couple, then committed suicide in &quot;a fit of madness&quot; brought on by frustration with the unit&#39;s discipline -- a conclusion it reaffirmed after a nine-month internal inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as John Follain&#39;s hard-hitting expos&amp;#233; shows, the official report was a travesty, a tissue of suppositions, contradictions, and omissions. Based on an exhaustive three-year investigation, &lt;em&gt;City of Secrets&lt;/em&gt; reveals how the Vatican, the oldest and most secretive autocracy in the world, staged an elaborate plot to obstruct justice -- and hide the scandals it dared not confess. &lt;/p&gt;" />
