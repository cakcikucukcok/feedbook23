  <title>November Ever After - Craig T. Greenlee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The legacy of the Marshall players who perished transcends wins and losses. Their tragic deaths squashed the likelihood of a bloody race riot on campus.&lt;i&gt; The evening of November 14, 1970 was damp and chilly with a steady drizzle and dense fog. Students at Marshall University had no idea that the nights horrific events would change their lives forever. &lt;p&gt;
On this night, a plane crash wiped out most of the schools football team. Unless you were there, you could never fully comprehend the gravity of grief that engulfed Huntington, West Virginia, in the days following the worst aviation disaster in the history of American sports. &lt;p&gt;
I know. &lt;p&gt;
I was there. &lt;p&gt;
Ill never forget. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;It could have been me on that plane.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 I played football at MU for two seasons. A year before the tragedy, I left the team for personal reasons. When the school began the daunting task of resurrecting its football program in the spring of 71, it was a no-brainer decision for me to rejoin the team and become part of the rebuilding process. &lt;p&gt;
Media projects devoted to the plane crash provide well-deserved  notoriety. Still, there are glaring omissions. Now, for the first time, former Marshall defensive back Craig T. Greenlee tells the real story  the whole story  about Thundering Herd football from back in the day." />
