  <title>Paul - N. T. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this definitive biography, renowned Bible scholar, Anglican bishop, and bestselling author N. T. Wright offers a radical look at the apostle Paul, illuminating the humanity and remarkable achievements of this intellectual who invented Christian theology&amp;#8212;transforming a faith and changing the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For centuries, Paul, the apostle who &quot;saw the light on the Road to Damascus&quot; and made a miraculous conversion from zealous Pharisee persecutor to devoted follower of Christ, has been one of the church&amp;#8217;s most widely cited saints. While his influence on Christianity has been profound, N. T. Wright argues that Bible scholars and pastors have focused so much attention on Paul&amp;#8217;s letters and theology that they have too often overlooked the essence of the man&amp;#8217;s life and the extreme unlikelihood of what he achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To Wright, &quot;The problem is that Paul is central to any understanding of earliest Christianity, yet Paul was a Jew; for many generations Christians of all kinds have struggled to put this together.&quot; Wright contends that our knowledge of Paul and appreciation for his legacy cannot be complete without an understanding of his Jewish heritage. Giving us a thoughtful, in-depth exploration of the human and intellectual drama that shaped Paul, Wright provides greater clarity of the apostle&amp;#8217;s writings, thoughts, and ideas and helps us see them in a fresh, innovative way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paul&lt;/em&gt; is a compelling modern biography that reveals the apostle&amp;#8217;s greater role in Christian history&amp;#8212;as an inventor of new paradigms for how we understand Jesus and what he accomplished&amp;#8212;and celebrates his stature as one of the most effective and influential intellectuals in human history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
