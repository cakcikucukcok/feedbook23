  <title>Call Sign, White Lily (5th Edition) - M.G. Crisci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With Mother Russia under siege, a daring 17-year old teenage girl hangs up her ice skates and heads for the skies. Initially rebuffed as a child in a man&amp;#39;s world, her unparalleled flying skills make believers of even the most battle-hardened Russian pilot.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;At the tender age of 18 she becomes the world&amp;#39;s first female flying ace.  By the age of 21 she has lived a breathtaking existence, completing 268 missions against Hitler&amp;#39;s vaunted Luftwaffe, recording 15 solo kills, and assisting on countless others. In the process the publicity surrounding Lilia&amp;#39;s exploits make her Hitler&amp;#39;s worst nightmare. She is also shot down four times,falls madly in love with her handsome squadron commander, and still finds time to laugh, smile and read poetry, her other great love.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lilia&amp;#39;s incredible, and largely unknown story in the West, is set as historical fiction against the background of a devastating war that claimed the lives of as many as 30 million Soviet soldiers and citizens.  Despite the difficult times, Lilia&amp;#39;s bittersweet story contains the simple desire of many woman: to have a loving husband that brings surprises, a family full of laughter and love, and a world where peace reigns supreme. For all people, for all time.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Lilia&amp;#39;s only fear was that her sacrifices, and those of so many others, would be lost in time. Sadly, that is precisely what happened. Lilia was lost somewhere over the Eastern Ukraine seven days before her 22nd, and she did not receive her just due for another 47 years!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Call Sign, White Lily is proof positive that life is a destination to an unknown destination." />
