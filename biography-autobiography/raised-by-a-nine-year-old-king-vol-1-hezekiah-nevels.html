  <title>Raised by a Nine-Year Old King: Vol 1 - Hezekiah Nevels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This story is about a nine year old boy given the opportunity to live on the streets of Philadelphia. He had to grow up through the most chaotic times in the history of America. Jim crow, Vietnam War, Gang Wars, Four assignations (John F. Kennedy Jr., Martin L. King Jr., Bobby Kennedy and Malcolm X), ( Civil Rights Movement) Race riots, the Love and Peace movement (Sex and Drugs Revolution) and Motown and Rock &amp; Roll ( Music revolution). There were a lot of grown ups who did not survive those times. It&#39;s very interesting how this nine year old found his way through forty something years of fear, horror, torture, sex, drugs, people, places and things. Though the grace of GOD he is still keep, keeping on. This is the first book of a five part series. Series number one Raised By A Nine Year Old (King). The four other series are not titled as of yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please understand that this book was written with a lot of emotion.  What I went through to get the words out was so devastating. It took a lot out of me, to recall those moments of time. I literally had to relive those moments of pain, horror, fear and torture. Some of those times were not as bad as others, but it was hard to do, just the same. 
This first book is about a boy caught up in time. A time he never under stood. This boy was pushed to grow-up a at time in his life, when he had no understanding of what he was about to go through. Everything came fast, untimed and shocking. He was shot out into life with no warning and no skills. He had to learn by trail and era. He is still carrying those traits with him today after over forty years.  He grew up and became a man, with the absence of that little boy, who never got a chance to experience what it would have been like to be one. He was always forcing his self to go through the elements of life, always fighting, hoping and praying. Today I can say he survived by the skin of his teeth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing about his survival is what, who, and how he went through these forty something years. In the series to come, you will learn about how he evolved, through those trying years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This boy live a life, that proves, that, when you are walking in the sand and one moment you look down and see two pairs of foot prints in the sand and for forty years of walking in that sand you only see one pair of foot steps. You know that you were carried through all those years. For that I am surely blesses. I know that I could not have walked through those forty years on my own. I stated earlier this boy had no warning and no skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank GOD for GOD&lt;/p&gt;" />
