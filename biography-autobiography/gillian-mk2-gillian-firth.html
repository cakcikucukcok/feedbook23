  <title>Gillian Mk2 - Gillian Firth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Suddenly, in 1994, the author stopped taking life for granted.  When her existence filled with sunshine, parties and good times came to an end.  A near fatal car crash left her comatose for six weeks; Gillian doesnt know what happened on that night and never will. Gillian Mk2 chronicles her feisty determination to regain independence in a society where she was invisible. We follow her trek for the first four years.
From hospitals, doctors, falls, nurses onto more hospitals, specialists, falls, attitudes, patients Gillian Firth is lucky, clearly her family adore her, she lives to tell the tale and does so with blunt honesty.  She knew nothing and only remembered she smoked because Pathetic bought her cigarettes, into the hospital ironically, her mum went mad.
A Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is serious, life-changing, but you laugh out loud, then cry and laugh again, as we listen to Gillian speaking.  Watch how she improves, cringe or agree with her observations, feel the anger and frustration, be embarrassed by comments and reactions.  This author will be remembered for her flippant, but serious, heart rending yet hilarious, kick in the teeth, thats what it is.
Funny, factual and inspirational my eyes are open." />
