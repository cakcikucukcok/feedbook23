  <title>It Is What It Is and It Aint What It Was - Shanna Hindson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t know why I&#39;ve written this book, I don&#39;t even know if anyone will ever read past this blurb but what I do know is.... Tough times don&#39;t last, Tough people do!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child you have delusions of grandeur that by the time you&#39;re 30 you&#39;ll be famous, have a huge house and possibly even servants....Yeah right...More likely a 9-5 job, boyfriend and grossly, hair in places that really isn&#39;t necessary! At 28 my life wasn&#39;t what I&#39;d imagined and was about to get a whole lot further from that childhood fantasy....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not gonna give too much away, just simply say that I write about my experiences...Please don&#39;t buy this thinking it&#39;s a Bridget Jones blockbuster, more like the Lambrini drinking, day time TV watching version...where cheating arseholes are seen for what they really are, grannies are people to beware of and revenge is the only drug you will ever need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for those of you struggling with a break up, feeling like your life is just stuck in a rut or dwelling on the past......Read on and move forward....I hope I can make you realise... A clock doesn&#39;t go backwards so why should you!&lt;/p&gt;" />
