  <title>Praey to God - Annette Cloutier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pry To God is a Tasteful Trip not only through the Faith of the author, but through Faith itself. It
begins in Volume I as a memoir and ends in Volume VI where the memoir is placed on an altar. In between
the pages of the six volumes, the memoir Trips through theologies of worshipnot only underscoring
the beauty of the memoir, but propelling the development of Faith to a new and exalted level. In Miss
Cloutirs six successive volumes of Pry To God: A Tasteful Trip Through Faith, she examines in detail
her own Roman Catholic Faith by tracing its origins from ancient Judaism and Gnosticism, the flavors
of which appear not only in the development of Christianity, but also in the development of Islam.
Pry To God recounts how the authors Trip through Faith stumbled along the way in ventures with
Scientology and Astrology until a balanced was achieved by her association with the Monsignor and her
studies in Theology at Boston College and Harvard, culminating in a love story comparable with the Sound
Of Music, My Fair Lady, and The Thornbirds.
Pry To God incorporates a timely French Connection, the authors love of Boston Sports, and her keen
interest in matters Theological.
Pry To God includes the recent 20022010 reappraisal of the authenticity of the Shroud of Turin, with
the authors further investigation of its medieval French connection, and its association with the current
reevaluation of the genuineness of the 20052007 rediscovery of the Jesus Family Tomb. The Shroud of
Turin, coupled with the Jesus Family Tomb, and the 2007 discovery of the Tomb of Herod the Great
make for a fascinating historical interpretation of the New Testament Gospels by the author; revealing a
more genuine-magnificent Jesus-Mary Story.
Pry To God also incorporates an apt and a personal understanding of the 2008 Economic Catastrophe,
including American presidential politics, with a look towards a Global Realization of all people
recognized as equal in life, even to the extent of Economically Equality. Wage by Age, as suggested
by the author, is 21st centurys new mantra given to relax the social injustice experienced throughout the
ages. With a culture of Con-U-Nism evolving mankind into Money-Monkeys, Pry To God offers an
ordained resolution.
Pry To God is a rare but relevant penetration into Religion. It bridges the academic theological scholarship
of Harvard into an everyday world perspective.
Pry To God holds fascinating insights and historical interpretations that could very well signal an ending
of, tripping through Faith, sending shock-waves throughout the religious world and established society.
The authors theological insights into the topic of Religion in our current social climate are sure to linger
long after reading Pry To God: A Tasteful Trip Through Faith is a fait accompli." />
