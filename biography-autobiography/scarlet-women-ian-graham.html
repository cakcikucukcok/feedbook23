  <title>Scarlet Women - Ian Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In  1965, an impoverished elderly woman was found dead in Nice, France. Her  death marked the end of an era; she was the last of the great  courtesans. Known as La Belle Otero, she was a volcanic Spanish beauty  whose patrons included Kaiser Wilhelm II, the Prince of Wales (later  King Edward VII) and Grand Duke Nicholas of Russia. She accumulated an  enormous fortune, but gambled it all away. &lt;i&gt;Scarlet Women&lt;/i&gt; tells her story and many more, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marie Duplessis, who inspired characters by both Dumas and Verdi;&lt;br&gt;Clara  Ward, a rare American courtesan who hunted for a European aristocrat,  but having married a Belgian prince, ran away with a gypsy violinist;&lt;br&gt;Ninon  de L&#39;Enclos, who was offered 50,000 crowns by Cardinal Richelieu for  one night. Money left in her will paid for Voltaire&#39;s education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Courtesans  were an elite group of talented, professional mistresses. The most  successful became wealthy and famous in their own right. While they led  charmed lives, they occupied a curious position: they enjoyed freedom  and political power unknown to most women, but they were ostracised by  polite society. From the hetaerae of ancient Greece to the cortigiani  onesti of 16th century Venice, the oiran of Edo-period Japan to the  demimondaines of 19th century France, this captivating book--perfect for  readers of &lt;i&gt;A Treasury of Royal Scandals&lt;/i&gt;--uncovers the rich, colorful lives of these women who dared to pursue fortunes outside their societies&#39; norms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
