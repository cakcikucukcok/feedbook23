  <title>Life Notes: Reflections of a British Virgin Islander - Joseph Reynold O&#39;Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From the Foreword&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;As the title of this book implies, &lt;b&gt;Life Notes&lt;/b&gt; is largely about the personal recollections of a native British Virgin Islander, who has raised our awareness by committing to print a font of information about the times in which he lived  hard times of the early years, the relatively good times of the middle years, and the visible and sometimes not so tangible achievements of a total life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Life Notes&lt;/b&gt; is not an historical text but it is eminently enlightening and charged with historical truths.  It should be embraced as required reading for anyone who aspires to become familiar with the history and culture of the British Virgin Islands in the Twentieth Century.  J.R.s folksy style as a writer makes it easy reading.  He is humorous and engaging and, like the man himself, the book is compellingly frank and honest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cyril B. Romney&lt;br&gt;
Former Chief Minister&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;JOSEPH REYNOLD ONEAL&lt;/b&gt; was born in Virgin Gorda in 1911 and has led a rich and varied life since.  An entrepreneur who evolved into one of the titans of business leadership in the Virgin Islands, Mr. ONeal (or J.R. as many call him) also found time to devote himself to political and environmental affairs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mr. ONeal has won distinction and several awards for his many years of community service and for his leadership in the business arena.  As chairman of the National Parks Trust for some thirty years, he spearheaded the reforestation of Sage Mountain and Gorda Peak.  In recognition of his work on behalf of the Trust, the Botanic Gardens in Road Town were named in his honour in 1988.  In 1990, Mr. ONeal was also named to the Global 500, a United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) honour roll of people who have contributed to the preservation of the environment around the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Mr. ONeal was awarded the C.B.E. (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) by Her Majesty the Queen in 1998, following M.B.E. and O.B.E. awards.  In 2002, he was awarded the Badge of Honour by the Government of the British Virgin  Islands.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
