  <title>Frederick Douglass - D. H. Dilbeck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From his enslavement to freedom, Frederick Douglass was one of America&#39;s most extraordinary champions of liberty and equality. Throughout his long life, Douglass was also a man of profound religious conviction. In this concise and original biography, D. H. Dilbeck offers a provocative interpretation of Douglass&#39;s life through the lens of his faith. In an era when the role of religion in public life is as contentious as ever, Dilbeck provides essential new perspective on Douglass&#39;s place in American history.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Douglass came to faith as a teenager among African American Methodists in Baltimore. For the rest of his life, he adhered to a distinctly prophetic Christianity. Imitating the ancient Hebrew prophets and Jesus Christ, Douglass boldly condemned evil and oppression, especially when committed by the powerful. Dilbeck shows how Douglass&#39;s prophetic Christianity provided purpose and unity to his wide-ranging work as an author, editor, orator, and reformer. As &quot;America&#39;s Prophet,&quot; Douglass exposed his nation&#39;s moral failures and hypocrisies in the hopes of creating a more just society. He admonished his fellow Americans to truly abide by the political and religious ideals they professed to hold most dear. Two hundred years after his birth, Douglass&#39;s prophetic voice remains as timely as ever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
