  <title>Inspiring the Youth of America by Remington Registries - J Alex Ficarra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here at Remington, many people are curious about this powerful book commonly known as Inspiring the Youth of America. Well, as you may know, our youth today in America are in dire need of mentorship and guidance. This book is a whole new step forward for all of us as a civilization.
For many years, and even today, young Americans wander aimlessly in a pool of confusion. They end up in meaningless careers with no past, no future, and nothing to hope for. Undoubtedly, the end result is misery and despair. The end result is poverty and surely a feeling of emptiness. Well, we at Remington, after interviewing over thirty thousand professionals, were surprised to find that many successful professionals were disgusted with vanity publications. They were disappointed with the meaningless dribble of a phone booktype registry that possibly required a magnifying glass just to read. But surprisingly enough, these professionals encouraged any use of their biography for humanitarian purposes. Undoubtedly, mentorship for our youth fell into that category. So there it was born.
Our proudest moment as publishers was laid out before us. But there was one big problem. All these people needed to be interviewed in depth, and generic biographies certainly would not inspire. So with that, we swallowed hard, and our staff got to work. Yes, it was and still is a grueling, time-consuming mission and undertaking. But in the end, as you may witness as you read this book, the content is quite spectacular and certainly worth the effort. We would also like to mention that the participants in this book also spent much time sending us information and encouraging us to make this book worthy of their efforts. Now it was up to us to uphold the dignity of these professionals and forge forward into a future where a student can explore his or her life with the ability to fulfill their own potentials.
With that, this book is presented to you today, and we hope that you share in our dream to build a better America from where it really mattersour youth." />
