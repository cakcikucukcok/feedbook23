  <title>Cry from the Mountains - Keith Decker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Keith Decker knows from personal experience what it is to be abandoned, hungry, and with no place to lay his head. By the time he is a junior in high school he has spent more nights than he can count with friends and more days than he wants to remember wondering where his next meal will come from. Then, at age seventeen he hits rock bottom. After a devastating event, he asks himself, What if I fell into a black hole tonight? And then he answers his own question: Nobody would even miss me. 
Cry from the Mountains is the story of how God hears and answers Keiths cry  and it is the story of how He continues to answer, even today. It is the story of how God takes an unlikely lad from Eastern Kentucky, gives him purpose and hope, and molds him into a minister who touches the lives of thousands of people in the heart of Appalachia who are living in similar circumstances to those in which Keith grew up. 
Cry from the Mountains not only chronicles Keiths personal journey but also the history of Cedaridge Ministries in Williamsburg, Ky., which he began twenty-three years ago to address the needs of impoverished people in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky." />
