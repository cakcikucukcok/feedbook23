  <title>Beautifully Broken, Seeing Beyond Trauma - Laural Hemenway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Beautifully Broken, Seeing Beyond Trauma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This story is about life and death, but in reverse. It begins with a death and ends with a life. Both are Mine. On October 7, 2014, a part of me suddenly and violently died. More than two years after the events that occurred that day, I was diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Since then, I have been on a journey of self-discovery, where night terrors, panic attacks and hopelessness consumed me as I blindly wondered through a seemingly endless wilderness to strange and unexpected places. Even so, I have to acknowledge that through the hardships I endured, I learned to see myself from a new perspective and, in many ways, I learned to love the self I now see reflected in the mirror. I have no illusions, however, that the world around me has become a better place since 2014, or that prejudice, discrimination or humankind&amp;rsquo;s cannibalistic demolition of each other&amp;rsquo;s character or reputation has diminished. My journey did not lead to world peace, but it did bring me a sense of inner peace as I sat with the Universe alone on a bench in a chapel nearly three years after the traumatic events of 2014 surrendering to my higher power, whispering the words, &amp;ldquo;I believe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
