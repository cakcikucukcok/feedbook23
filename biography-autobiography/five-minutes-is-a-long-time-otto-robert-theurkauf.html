  <title>Five Minutes Is a Long Time - Otto Robert Theurkauf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From 1950 to 200, Otto. Robert Theurkauf had the uncommon experience of working fifty years for one firm, Scudder, Stevens and Clark. He had his victories and his defeats. But then, in April 1982, as Chairman of Scudders Investment Policy Committee, he predicted the end of the a bear market, a twelve year period when the market had been under water. To the complete surprise of almost all, 1982 was the start of the greatest bull market of all time.
His story is a journey from One Wall Street, to California, to Japan, and back to Park Avenue and with some interesting places in between. His transfer to California in 1962 at age 35 was a turning point in his personal development as well as his career. There was more than on future path along the way. His life could have turned out differently, but it didnt.
His good show hunter, Indiana Jones, is twenty five years old and is retired in Florida. Since Indy doesnt want to show any more, neither does Theurkauf  and he is also retired from showing.
Theurkauf and his wife live in a small town fifty miles north of New York City." />
