      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The stress, obstacles, and struggles in life can sometimes be overwhelming and simply too much to bear. However, the spiritual and psychic world can just as often offer us the guidance, assistance, and lessons we need to overcome these challenges. While these lessons may be immediately elusive and difficult to grasp, what can we do in our spiritual, emotional, and psychic lives that will allow us to change our perspective and embrace the power of the spirit?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As author Alison Lakes confides in her innermost journals a story that begins with heartache and despair, a womans spiritual journey unfolds in ways that put her in touch with her dreams and on the true path toward solace and rejuvenation. Her careful, sensitive storytelling and recollections of love stand as a guide for helping us realise our spiritual connections.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Discover the way our spiritual guides and personal visions and intuitions can help us through the most arduous of circumstances. Explore how our pastand even our past livescan profoundly influence the future and our self-realization. And allow one womans story to touch your heart and help take your soul to the clear heights over and above confusion and doubt.&lt;/P&gt;" />
