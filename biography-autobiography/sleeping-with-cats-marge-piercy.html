  <title>Sleeping with Cats - Marge Piercy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marge Piercy, a writer who is highly praised as both a poet and a novelist, turns her gaze inward as she shares her thoughts on life and explores her development as a woman and writer. She pays tribute to the one loving constant that has offered her comfort and meaning even as the faces and events in her life have changed -- her beloved cats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With searing honesty, Piercy tells of her strained childhood growing up in a religiously split, working-class family in Detroit. She examines her myriad friendships and relationships, including two painful early marriages, and reveals their effects on her creativity and career. More than a reminiscence of things past, however, &lt;em&gt;Sleeping With Cats&lt;/em&gt; is also a celebration of the present and the future, as Piercy shares her views on aging, creativity, and finding a lasting and improbable love with a man fourteen years younger than herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chronicle of the turbulent and exciting journey of one artist&#39;s life, &lt;em&gt;Sleeping With Cats&lt;/em&gt; is a deeply intimate, unforgettable story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
