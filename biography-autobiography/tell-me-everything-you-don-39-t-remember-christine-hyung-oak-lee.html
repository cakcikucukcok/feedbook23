  <title>Tell Me Everything You Don&#39;t Remember - Christine Hyung-Oak Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A memoir of reinvention after a stroke at age thirty-three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christine Hyung-Oak Lee woke up with a headache on the morning of December 31, 2006. By that afternoon, she saw the world&amp;#8212;quite literally&amp;#8212;upside down. By New Year&amp;#8217;s Day, she was unable to form a coherent sentence. And after hours in the ER, days in the hospital, and multiple questions and tests, her doctors informed her that she had had a stroke.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For months afterward, Lee outsourced her memories to a journal, taking diligent notes to compensate for the thoughts she could no longer hold on to. It is from these notes that she has constructed this frank and compelling memoir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a precise and captivating narrative, Lee navigates fearlessly between chronologies, weaving her childhood humiliations and joys together with the story of the early days of her marriage; and then later, in painstaking, painful, and unflinching detail, the account of her stroke and every upset&amp;#8212;temporary or permanent&amp;#8212;that it caused.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee illuminates the connection between memory and identity in an honest, meditative, and truly funny manner, utterly devoid of self-pity. And as she recovers, she begins to realize that this unexpected and devastating event has provided a catalyst for coming to terms with her true self&amp;#8212;and, in a way, has allowed her to become the person she&amp;#8217;s always wanted to be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
