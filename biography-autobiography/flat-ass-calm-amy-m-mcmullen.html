  <title>Flat Ass Calm - Amy M McMullen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When author Amy M. McMullen was young, she wasn&amp;rsquo;t preoccupied with dolls, dresses, or boys like other little girls; instead she was fixated on a Maine island called Monhegan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, illustrated with photographs and art, Amy covers a segment of her life, beginning as a very small child and ending in her early twenties. &amp;nbsp;She describes growing up in an unusual family on Cape Cod during the 1960s, her early teenage years in California, and finally her life as a homesteader on a small island off the Maine coast. She delves deeply into the psyche of a child who became unwittingly caught up in the destructive upheavals caused by her parent&amp;rsquo;s divorce and her mother&amp;rsquo;s spiral down into alcoholism, and how this scripted her life choices later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her family&amp;rsquo;s connection to the idyllic island of Monhegan, where she often summered as a child, planted a seed of longing in a little girl whose family life was out of control. This soon developed into recurring dreams that couldn&amp;rsquo;t be shaken until she ran away from home at the age of sixteen to live on Monhegan with an older man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During their six year relationship, Amy and her husband homesteaded on the nearby tiny uninhabited island of Manana, raising goats for a cheesemaking business and having two children. But what had been a dream of safety and stability quickly became a nightmare, fraught with danger, alcohol, drugs, and domestic abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amy&amp;rsquo;s lyrically-written observations throughout this account are wry, funny, and often horrifying, but they deftly capture the essence of life on an isolated Maine island during the seventies. This is a true story of a small fishing community that had become infiltrated by hippies, and a young woman who had to battle overwhelming odds and learn the hard way how to grow up and create her own future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
