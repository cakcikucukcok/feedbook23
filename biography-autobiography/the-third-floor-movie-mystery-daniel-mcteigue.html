  <title>The Third Floor Movie Mystery - Daniel McTeigue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When my band Third Floor broke up in December of 1989 I got into renting movies on the weekend. I had gone about 3 years not watching any movies because I was so busy with music. VCRs were new and renting movies was the new thing. I started hearing the phrase Third Floor in a lot of movies. I thought I may have been losing my mind so I started a list of the movies where I heard Third Floor in them. I also counted movies where there were scenes that the director did a close up of a door with a 300 series number because I figured that most 300 series rooms are on the Third Floor. My list grew and grew. Twentythree years later with me seemingly unable to get a full time job I dug out the old lists and found out that I had about 90 movies. So I decided it was book worthy. While writing the book the movie total grew to 115 movies. There is some sort of conspiracy going on here but I dont know what it is. The whole first half of the book is talking about how I always dreamed of being a drummer in a band and I tell my life story of what it was like to bring a dream to fruition and how I co-formed the band Third Floor and then I transition into the movie topic. If youre a person who loves movies, youve got to get this book." />
