  <title>The Stump - Terry Braddock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three guys I didn&amp;rsquo;t recognize stood outside the door as I came down the steps of a Chicago apartment&amp;nbsp;building. I had just finished up collecting newspaper fees for delivering the daily paper.&amp;nbsp;One stepped inside, walked toward me, and said, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up?&amp;rdquo; I looked at him and said, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;up with you?&amp;rdquo; As he stepped closer I saw a gun in his waistband and it made me think of my&amp;nbsp;father, who always said, &amp;ldquo;Think before you react, son.&amp;rdquo; If I reach for his gun, I thought, he could be&amp;nbsp;faster than me. He also had buddies just outside the door. My decision was made for me when the&amp;nbsp;boys stepped into the hallway and surrounded me. It took me only a second to think, Is your life&amp;nbsp;worth ninety bucks of newspaper collection fees? I pulled the money out of my pocket and handed&amp;nbsp;it over, and he said, &amp;ldquo;Now that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.&amp;rdquo; He pulled out his gun, pointed it at me,&amp;nbsp;and pulled the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I knew at a young age in my city of Chicago that more bad things were happening than good,&amp;nbsp;especially for me, an African American growing up in the &amp;rsquo;60s and &amp;rsquo;70s, living on the South Side.&amp;nbsp;Given that, our teachers should have been our role models. Yet when held after class one day,&amp;nbsp;my teacher told me, &amp;ldquo;To set you on the right path, I want you to strive to be . . . a custodian.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;nbsp;jumped up and said, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be no janitor.&amp;rdquo; He said, &amp;ldquo;Now, now, you&amp;rsquo;re a &amp;lsquo;N&amp;rsquo; and there&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;not a lot of opportunities for &amp;lsquo;N&amp;rsquo;s.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran to the Stump, the crumbling steps of an apartment building where I knew Mrs. Hannaberry&amp;nbsp;would be, and I told her what my teacher had said. She hugged me and responded, &amp;ldquo;You are&amp;nbsp;better than this, and you are going to do better. Let no one tell you different. The first thing you&amp;nbsp;must do is believe in yourself. Do you believe?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stump prepared me for my life-long journey. It shaped me to see a brighter future, realize&amp;nbsp;I had a future. It all started at the Stump&amp;mdash;my way out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
