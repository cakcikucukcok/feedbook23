  <title>Undiscovered Scotland - W.H. Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Mountaineering in Scotland, climber and mountaineer W.H. Murray vividly describes some of the most sought-after and classic British climbs on rock and ice, including the Cuillin Ridge on Skye and Ben Nevis. 
The book – written in secret on toilet paper in whilst Murray was a prisoner of war – is infused with the sense of freedom and joy the author found in the mountains. He details the hardship and pleasure wrung from high camping in winter, climbs Clachaig Gully and makes the second winter ascent of Observatory Ridge. Murray recounts his adventures in Glencoe and the mountains beyond – including a terrifying near-death experience at the falls of Falloch.
Murray’s first book, Mountaineering in Scotland is widely acknowledged as a classic of mountaineering literature. It inspirational prose – as fresh now as when first published – is bound to make a reader reach for their tent and head for the hills of Scotland. He asserts, ‘Seeming danger ensures that on mountains, more than elsewhere, life may be lived at the full.’ 
This is classic mountain climbing literature at its best." />
