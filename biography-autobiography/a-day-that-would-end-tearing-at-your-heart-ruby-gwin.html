  <title>A Day That Would End Tearing at Your Heart - Ruby Gwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even now, nineteen years after my sons injury, I feel my praying for a miracle was answered. Dans faith in believing has been astounding. The insight of his spiritual belief, I realize, was based from his youth. Dan was a happy child. He sets goals early on; his bravery has been so inspiring, for he had many crosses to bear when his life was changed dramatically. Instead of his family assuring him, it was him who assured us that God had a purpose. He transformed what he believed by proving his confidence in doing and by a living faith. It easily could have been farewell to farming, but he proved to himself and to others he could fulfill his long-time dream of farming. He looked to the bright side with I can instead of I cant, by staying true to his vision and keeping focus on tomorrow and moving toward larger visions.
I, myself, had to learn all over to what one would say, letting go. There was not an hour in twenty-four I didnt worry. By mere osmosis, I absorb the craft of letting Dan have an open road just as I did in his young youth. He proved paralysis is a choice and that what ifs are a waste of time." />
