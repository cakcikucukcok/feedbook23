      <meta name="description" content="This book covers my life through the aftermath of a failed suicide attempt, through two tribulations from February 2003 to March 2011 and the period after that, through present day. The book&#39;s purpose is to convey divine messages to everyone.
I AM A MESSENGER. Ive give the reader a lot of Scripture, intertwined with my life events, good and bad. As the words go in the song Amazing Grace: 
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me....
I once was lost but now am found,
Was blind, but now, I see.
I was truly a wretch.  I went through all kinds of Hell, I literally laughed at the Devil, and received the Grace of God.  I hope my story will inspire you to get through tough times, when they arise." />
