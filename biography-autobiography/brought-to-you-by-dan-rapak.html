  <title>Brought to You by . . . - Dan Rapak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With a career spanning 37 years in television broadcasting including 29
years at the ABC Television Network, Dan Rapak gives us a glimpse of
what went on behind the scenes to broadcast major events. The stories
range from televising The Super Bowl and The Olympics to the accident
at Three Mile Island. Learn about the extraordinary efforts to get The
1989 World Series back on the air after the Loma Prieta Earthquake struck
San Francisco. Find out what it took to bring home those unforgettable
images of Captain John Testrake sitting in his cockpit being interviewed
by ABC News while a terrorist waved a pistol behind the Captains head
following the hijacking of TWA Flight 847.
Here is a rare look at what happened behind the cameras and microphones
to bring those events and others into our homes. Read about the obstacles
that had to be overcome, the hard work, the triumphs and the sometimes
zany antics of the professionals who worked to put those broadcasts on
the air and bring those stories and images to America and to the world." />
