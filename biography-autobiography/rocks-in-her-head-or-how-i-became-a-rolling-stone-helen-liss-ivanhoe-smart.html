  <title>Rocks in Her Head or How I Became a Rolling Stone - Helen Liss Ivanhoe Smart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1950 the Ivanhoes were a stable family living in the oil town of Bakersfield, California. An oil geologist father with a secure job at Standard Oil and a wide circle of friends. 
Then calamity struck! Their teenage son was sent to Juvenile Hall for stealing. Overcome by shame, unable to face their friends, the family moved. From job to job, from country to country, uncertainty and frugality ruled their lives for decades. 
An arrest in Moscow by the KGB. In Poland, a fight for restitution of a stolen suitcase. Such events colored their travels. 
When the gypsy wonderers finally decided to retum to California, the author, with little money and no hotel reservations but lots of moxie, travels alone to Tehran, Bangkok, Manila, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Vancouver. 
Rocks in Her Head is an unembellished personal story told with humor, sincerity and candor as the author describes her dynamic life of travel and determination in diverse lands. 
What a trip! Youll love every page, every mile Helen Smart takes you in her charming and yes, very wise true story remaking her familys lives
