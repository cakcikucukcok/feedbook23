  <title>Musings of a Maine Man Abroad - Robert James Shand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written by a Maine man living in Mexico, this collection of short stories, essays, plays, and poems elicits a kaleidoscope of emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tales are funny, horrible, and uplifting by turns. Author Robert James Shand provides a full disclosure of his personal life, from his experiences as a child growing up in Brewer, Maine, to his thoughts and feelings while living in Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through his stories, he describes gaining a deeper appreciation for the changing of the seasons in Maine, reflects on celebrating Veterans Day in Mexico, and laughs about the time no one believed that he saw a naked woman running down the street&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, Shand recalls his experiences serving in Vietnam as well as the traumatic stress he coped with upon returning home. Throughout &lt;i&gt;Musings of a Maine Man Abroad&lt;/i&gt;, he maintains and supports his core beliefs about the world, God, and his personal relationship with Jesus. &lt;/p&gt;" />
