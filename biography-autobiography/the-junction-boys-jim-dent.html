  <title>The Junction Boys - Jim Dent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The legendary Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant is recognized nationwide as one of the greatest coaches ever. So why did he always cite his 1-9 A&amp;M team of 1954 as his favorite? This is the story of a remarkable team - and the beginning of the legend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Junction Boys&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of Coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant&#39;s legendary training camp in the small town of Junction, Texas. In a move that many consider the salvation of the Texas A&amp;M football program, Coach Bryant put 115 players through the most grueling practices ever imagined. Only a handful of players survived the entire 10 days, but they braved the intense heat of the Texas sun and the burning passion of their coach, and turned a floundering team into one of the nation&#39;s best. &lt;i&gt;The Junction Boys&lt;/i&gt; is more than just a story of tough practices without water breaks. An extraordinary fellowship was forged from the mind-numbing pain. The thirty-five survivors bonded together like no other team in America. They profited from the Junction experience; the knowledge they took back with them to College Station, about themselves and what they were capable of, would be used for the rest of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In vivid and powerful images reminiscent of &lt;i&gt;Friday Night Lights, Hoosiers,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Last Picture Show&lt;/i&gt;, these young men and their driven coach come to life.&lt;i&gt; The Junction Boys &lt;/i&gt;contains all the hallmarks of a classic sports story, and it combines America&#39;s love of college football with an extraordinary story of perseverance and triumph.&lt;/p&gt;" />
