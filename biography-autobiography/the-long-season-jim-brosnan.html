  <title>The Long Season - Jim Brosnan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;One of the best baseball books ever written. It is probably one of the best American diaries as well.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A timeless classic from baseball&#39;s golden era, legendary pitcher Jim Brosnan&#39;s witty and candid chronicle of the 1959 Major League Baseball season, which set the standard for all sports memoirs to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Long Season&lt;/em&gt; was a revelation when it was first published in 1960. Here is an insider&#39;s perspective on America&#39;s national pastime that is funny, honest, and above all, real. The man behind this fascinating account of baseball and its players was not a sportswriter but a self-proclaimed &quot;average ballplayer&quot;&amp;#8212;a relief pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals. Called &quot;Professor&quot; by his teammates and &quot;Meat&quot; by his wife, Jim Brosnan turned out to be the ideal guide to the behind-the-scenes world of professional baseball with his keen observations, sharp wit, and clear-eyed candor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His player&#39;s diary takes readers on the mound and on the road; inside the clubhouse and most enjoyably inside his own head. While solving age-old questions like &quot;Why can&#39;t pitchers hit?&quot; and what makes for the best chewing tobacco, Brosnan captures the game-to-game daily experiences of an ordinary season, unapologetically, &quot;the way I saw it&quot;&amp;#8212;from sweating it out in spring training to blowing the opening game to a mid-season trade to the Cincinnati Reds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Long Season&lt;/em&gt;, Brosnan reveals, like no other sportswriter before him, the human side of professional ballplayers and has forever preserved not only a season, but a uniquely American experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
