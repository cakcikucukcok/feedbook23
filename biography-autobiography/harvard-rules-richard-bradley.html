  <title>Harvard Rules - Richard Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the richest, most influential, most powerful university in the world, but at the beginning of 2001, Harvard was in crisis. Students complained that a Harvard education had grown mediocre. Professors charged that the university cared more about money than about learning. Harvard may have possessed a $19 billion endowment, but had it lost its soul?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The members of Harvard&#39;s governing board knew that they had to act. And so they made a bold pick for Harvard&#39;s twenty-seventh president: former Treasury Secretary and intellectual prodigy economist Lawrence Summers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although famously brilliant, Summers was a high-stakes gamble. In the 1990s he had crafted American policies to stabilize the global economy, quietly becoming one of the world&#39;s most powerful men. But while many admired Summers, his critics called him elitist, imperialist, and arrogant beyond measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Larry Summers sits atop a university in a state of upheaval, unsure of what it stands for and where it is going. At stake is not just the future of Harvard University but also the way in which Harvard students see the world -- and the manner in which they lead it. Written despite the university&#39;s official opposition, &lt;strong&gt;Harvard Rules&lt;/strong&gt; uncovers what really goes on behind Harvard&#39;s storied walls -- the politics, sex, ambition, infighting, and intrigue that run rampant within the world&#39;s most important university.&lt;/p&gt;" />
