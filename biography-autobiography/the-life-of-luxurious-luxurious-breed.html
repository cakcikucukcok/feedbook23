  <title>The Life of Luxurious - Luxurious Breed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Country girl endured living with an alcoholic father, stepmom, biological mom, and siblings were considered a dysfunctional family. Unbelievable mental and physical abuse led to family separation. Transitioning from the country to the city hardships, embraced me with not understanding my own identity. The journey of being abandoned, molested, early motherhood, and incarceration was already written. During the process of not actually knowing how to live in my own skin I decided to make a huge step in the career world and became a 911 operator. I didn&#39;t realize that God was preparing me to tell the world that he is real. In the end God gave me credit for not completely giving up on him by blessing me with a husband, son daughter, and the patience to keep him first. And that&#39;s LilLuxurious&#39;s Story. Prayer does changes things." />
