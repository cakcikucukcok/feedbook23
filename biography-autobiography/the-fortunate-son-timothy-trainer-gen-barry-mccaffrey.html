  <title>The Fortunate Son - Timothy Trainer, Gen. Barry McCaffrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Fortunate Son&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; recounts the parallel lives of an &amp;nbsp;army brat and a group of Vietnam veterans who intersect decades after the war. &amp;nbsp;The veterans open up to me, the army brat, perhaps in a way they never have &amp;nbsp;with their own families. Why? Through my father, Top, their First Sergeant, we &amp;nbsp;have a common link. Over the years, we&amp;#39;ve gotten to know each other. They begin &amp;nbsp;to understand the sacrifices of an army family. But, more importantly, they &amp;nbsp;want me to understand how our family&amp;#39;s sacrifice and my father&amp;#39;s tour of duty &amp;nbsp;in Vietnam with them, in the jungles, gave them confidence to believe they &amp;nbsp;would make it home alive.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;The Fortunate Son&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is not about a single battle or a &amp;nbsp;single soldier&amp;#39;s tour of duty. You will meet us, learn something about us, and &amp;nbsp;get a glimpse of our lives during the war years. You&amp;#39;ll find out why half a &amp;nbsp;century after that tour of duty ended, we remain bound together. If you&amp;#39;ve ever &amp;nbsp;been in the military or part of a military family, you&amp;#39;ll know that we all are &amp;nbsp;bound together. For those who find the military to be foreign and unknown, our &amp;nbsp;story may help you to understand why it binds so many together.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Fourteen of these soldiers have shared their stories. Their &amp;nbsp;stories describe two life transitions&amp;mdash;first from civilian teenagers or young &amp;nbsp;men to combat grunts trying to stay alive in the jungle&amp;mdash;and then back to &amp;nbsp;stateside life. What happens between these transitions, as they slog through the &amp;nbsp;jungle day by day paints their portrait of Top, my father. Now, I appreciate &amp;nbsp;why they remain bound together half a century after their tour ended. Their &amp;nbsp;stories are an unexpected gift that bestows new insight to me on my father. So, &amp;nbsp;as you read and &amp;quot;listen&amp;quot; to these soldiers&amp;#39; stories, both what they say and how &amp;nbsp;they describe Top, you understand why I&amp;#39;ve learned that I am The Fortunate Son.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Author Timothy Trainer&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; is an army brat, born into the Army &amp;nbsp;in Japan and was a high school junior when his father retired from the Army. He did not arrive in the United States until he was past his &amp;nbsp;fifth birthday. After arriving in the United States, the Army life meant living &amp;nbsp;in various parts of the United States, on and off post, depending upon his &amp;nbsp;father&amp;#39;s duty station.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
