  <title>Ms. Thang Goes Back to School - Barbara Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fasten your seatbelts and get set for a raucous ride when the former Chocolate Singles Magazine founder and publisher reenters a public school classroom as a substitute teacher. Many of you may remember Ms. Thang as the successful entrepreneur who launched the first publication that introduced African American singles to the burgeoning world of personal ad dating, along with an enticing menu of star-studded parties at some of New Yorks most coveted venues and exclusive travels to exotic Caribbean destinations. But after a sensational fifteen-year run, the decline of print advertising dollars took its toll and Chocolate Singles was forced to fold the tent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abandoning the limelight and finding refuge in her new Atlanta domicile, Barbara Miles decided, after an extended hiatus, that a return to her original calling, teaching school, would be just the antidote for the simultaneous collapse of her business and marriage. Little did she suspect that twenty-first century schools function in a whole different and unpredictable orbit than the one she had known earlier. But the trooper that she is, Ms. Thang lifted her chin and buckled down to confront the bevy of surprises and challenges that greeted her as she tested her mettle for returning to a full-time teaching position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laugh or cry. Enjoy the read!&lt;/p&gt;
