  <title>Warbird Recovery - Gordon R. Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="April Fool&#39;s Day, 1992. Author Gordon R. Page receives a call from a business associate offering him the chance to travel to Russia in hopes of acquiring a rare World War II fighter plane. He&#39;s waited for this call for years-and it&#39;s not a joke. Packed with action, intrigue, and danger, &lt;I&gt;Warbird Recovery&lt;/I&gt; delivers Page&#39;s gripping true story of his journey to Russia to recover the aircraft and fulfill a lifelong dream.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In bitter winter conditions, Page journeys to St. Petersburg, Russia, in an attempt to recover a rare German Bf 109 fighter plane. But everything about traveling in the former Soviet Union only reinforces the vast differences between cultures. Placing a call, buying lunch, and even riding in a taxi-to say nothing of buying an aircraft-prove to be strange and dangerous.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Putting his life at risk, Page discovers that he must learn to negotiate and have plenty of cash on hand to ensure both his safety and his return to the United States. Yet nothing can compare to the excitement he experiences upon finding lost aircraft. Unfortunately, chasing a childhood dream just might cost him his life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
