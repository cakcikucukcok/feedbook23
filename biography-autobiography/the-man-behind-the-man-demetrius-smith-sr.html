  <title>The Man Behind the Man - Demetrius Smith Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the pursuit of honesty and success the author bares his entire soul for the readers in &quot;The Man Behind The Man&quot;. Throughout this book, readers will follow him on his lifes journey as he reveals his addictions, his faults, as well as his journey working for 13 years as personal assistant/tour manager for Grammy Award Winning Singer/ Song Writer/Producer R. Kelly.He tells his story and he tells it all; raw and uncut. This story is not for the faint of heart. 
   Demetrius takes his readers on a tour with him as he crosses paths with the likings of Craig Hodges, Bernie Mac, Lisa Raye, Aaliyah, Gerald Levert, Salt-n-Pepa, LL Cool J and this is just to name a few. Demetrius has a brave narrative to share in this story. This book emphasizes the reality of who The Man behind the Man&quot; really is.
    Many would disagree that this book is just another tell-all. Reserve judgments until you have read it for yourself. 
        &quot;As an avid reader, I believe plot purpose, and poignant point of view top my list as must haves where book selection may be concerned.No story lends itself to this proven theory better than this testimonial tell-all authored by Demetrius Smith, Sr.&quot; Submitted by Mical Roy!
    This book is truly a good one to read, and one you wont want to put down." />
