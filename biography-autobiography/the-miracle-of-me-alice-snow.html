  <title>The Miracle of Me - Alice Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Miracle of Me&lt;/i&gt; is funny, romantic, and ultimately heartbreakinga winning offbeat mix of &lt;i&gt;Six Feet Under&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eat Pray Love&lt;/i&gt;. While growing up in the eccentric family of undertakers, Alice Snow learned firsthand about death and impact on the living. As a young woman, she traveled the world, boarding with Dutch nuns who were entranced by the novelty of stove-top popcorn and witnessing the crushing poverty of Bolivia firsthand. Through these journeys, she learned that no oppression, grief or suffering could permanently crush the human spirit, or deny human beings of their power of hope. Love swept into her life and changed it forever, when she met Floyd, a handsome pilot who spoke to her soul. Their lifelong romance broke all of the rules and sustained them both through tremendous difficultiesincluding the challenge of facing their own mortality. &lt;p&gt; 
Alice Snow has been living with a brain tumor the past fifteen years. Her doctor told her many times, she was at deaths door, but she never believed them. She held fast to the belief that her life was meant to serve a higher purposethe purpose of inspiring others to lead their best lives through service, spirituality, and recognition of lifes precious gifts. This faith has been the key to her miraculous survival, and she is in a unique position to impart this powerful, positive message to her readers." />
