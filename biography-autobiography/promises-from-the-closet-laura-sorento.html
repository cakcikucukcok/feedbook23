  <title>Promises from the Closet - Laura Sorento</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Laura Sorento grew up in a home filled with lies and abuse. At a very young age, her mother had an affair with a divorced man named Bruce, who had three children. Shortly after that, her mom convinced her husband, Anthony, to buy a large home with Bruce and his children. 
Her mom had managed to pull off this twisted arrangement for almost ten years, ending with Laura being abused, humiliated, violated, and emotionally abandoned. Bruce was so abusive and her mother was so caught up with this love affair that she lost sight of everything. She became a totally different mother than Laura knew, and the home soon became a dysfunctional nightmare. 
Laura often would be chased into her closet, where Bruce would abuse her. While she lay in her closet crying, she would wonder why her mom never helped her. Her mom knew about all of it, but she would always find fault with Laura. She felt abandoned by her mom and afraid to tell her dad. Why did she allow this to go on? As Laura cried in her closet, she made promises to herself and to her future children that she hoped to have someday. She promised to love and protect them at any cost." />
