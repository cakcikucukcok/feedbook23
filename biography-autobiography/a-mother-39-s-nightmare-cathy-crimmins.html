  <title>A Mother&#39;s Nightmare - Cathy Crimmins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the tradition of &lt;/i&gt;Lorenzo&#39;s Oil&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; a brutally searing story of one mother&#39;s quest to save her child&#39;s life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;One day Kelly Crimmins was a happy seemingly healthy twelve-year-old; the next she confessed to her mom that she&#39;d had blood in her urine for months. After a series of tests, Kelly was diagnosed with a life-threatening, potentially terminal autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Mother&#39;s Nightmare &lt;/i&gt;details Cathy and Kelly&#39;s three-year medical and emotional journey, which took them from Philadelphia to Minnesota&#39;s Mayo Clinic and back again. Cathy writes about the toll taken on a young girl who suddenly becomes a patient, and about a mom who in fighting for her little girl&#39;s life becomes sick herself with worry and fear. As she did in her award-winning &lt;i&gt;Where Is the Mango Princess?,&lt;/i&gt; Cathy makes illness both personal and universal. It&#39;s an account all readers will find memorable and moving.&lt;/p&gt;" />
