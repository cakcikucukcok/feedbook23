  <title>Nick Clegg - Chris Bowers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In early April 2010 Nick Clegg was fighting for recognition, even as the young, fresh and personable leader of Britain&amp;amp;#8217;s third political party. Two weeks later he was the focus of &amp;amp;#145;Cleggmania&amp;amp;#8217; and his popularity was compared with Churchill&amp;amp;#8217;s. Four weeks after that he became the second most important figure in the government &amp;amp;#150; but within a year he was ridiculed and reviled as popular hopes turned to disappointment. But who is Nick Clegg? What has made him the man he is today? By what route did he enjoy one of the most spectacular rises &amp;amp;#150; and falls &amp;amp;#150; in British politics? This fully revised and updated edition of Chris Bowers&amp;amp;#8217; acclaimed biography contains an analysis of the first years of coalition government, and tells us what we can expect of the Deputy Prime Minister as the next general election approaches. With a lightness of touch that captures the spirit of the unstuffy Lib Dem leader, and with the benefit of access to Clegg himself and the many people who have shaped and worked with him, Bowers presents a sensitive, critical and above all insightful portrait of one of the leading political figures of our age. &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
