  <title>Watch Everything - Charles A. Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Charles A. Shaw&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; grew up in a segregated African-American neighborhood in St. Louis. His tight-knit community supported him, and he was inspired to become first a teacher and then a lawyer. From there, he worked his way up to federal prosecutor and state judge before President Bill Clinton appointed him to the federal bench.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaw quickly became dismayed by the inequality and severity of mandatory U.S. sentencing guidelines and how they affected young African-American men. Prosecutors opposed him at every turn as he sought to impose fair sentences, but he never wavered in seeking to promote equality and curb the destruction of African-American families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This insightful and at times humorous narrative demonstrates Shaws love for family, hard work, and God. Including an insiders view of an often unjust legal system, tales of working alongside some of the best legal minds in the country, and challenges to prevailing concepts, &lt;i&gt;Watch Everything&lt;/i&gt; offers a rare glimpse into the professional life of an unconventional federal judge.&lt;/p&gt;" />
