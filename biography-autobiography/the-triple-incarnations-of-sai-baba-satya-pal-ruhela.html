  <title>The Triple Incarnations of Sai  Baba - Satya Pal Ruhela</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This unique book provides comprehensive profiles of the three great incarnations of Sai Baba  Shirdi Sai Baba(1858-1918), Sathya Sai Baba (1926-2011) and the future Sri Prema Sai Baba whose advent in the present century has been prophesied. They carry the triple message of work, worship and wisdom.  Shirdi Sai Baba laid the base for secular integration and gave the message of duty as work, Sathya Sai Babas mission was to make every one realize that the same God resides in everyone. The future Prema Sai Baba will promote the evangelic news that not only God resides in everyone but everyone is GOD.
     The special features of this book are:
	It presents research based new information on the first two
Incarnations which will enable readers understand their lives, messages, miracles, and their status and unique roles as prophets --harbingers of the New Age Spirituality.
	It presents the thrilling future scenario of Prema Sai Babas divine life as revealed by Sathya  Sai Baba to his  closest  devotee Vasantha Sai who has been assured that she would be his wife Prema when he incarnates as Raja who would later be known as  Prema Sai Baba and the mother of their only son Rama. This book clears the prevailing confusion about Prema Sai Baba and gives a microscopic view of the New Age Spirituality." />
