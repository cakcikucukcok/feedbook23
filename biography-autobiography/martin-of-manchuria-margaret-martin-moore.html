  <title>Martin of Manchuria - Margaret Martin Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stanley Martins life begins with his strong Christian upbringing in St. Johns, Newfoundland. As a young man, he was asked to be the wireless operator on Dr. Wilfred Grenfells hospital ship, the Strathcona, which served the deep-sea fishermen and their families on the beautiful but rugged Labrador coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At twenty-six years old, armed only with his medical degrees, a handful of surgical instruments, and his faith, Martin set off with his wife Margaret, a nurse, into the wilds of Manchuria. It was a land of tigers, bandits, epidemics, and superstition. In the midst of chaos arose a hospital, a symbol of hope for the injured and sick for the entire region. Built with Martins leadership and ingenuity, the hospital became a fortunate presence when medical help was needed during Koreas Independence Movement. His strong faith in God, his medical skills, and the faithful support of his wife are revealed in Martin of Manchuria by his daughter, author Margaret Martin Moore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Martin of Manchuria&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a wonderful testament to Gods faithfulness and revelation of his love and healing through the lives of your father and mother. Thank you for sharing a well-written, highly engaging, and God glorifying account of the lives of his servants!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heidi Linton, CFK Executive Director&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your father was a most interesting man and an effective missionary for Christ. His achievements were marvelous. Your prose carries the reader along and maintains interest throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
