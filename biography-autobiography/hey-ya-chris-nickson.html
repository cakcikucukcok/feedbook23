  <title>Hey Ya! - Chris Nickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since 1994 OutKast have been reinventing the rules of hip-hop, blending different styles of music into a Southern style that is wholly their own, soulful, outrageous, and addictive. They&#39;ve captured the hearts of fans and music critics alike, and have achieved records and scaled heights in the music world that most artists can only dream of. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full story of OutKast has never before been told. Now in &lt;i&gt;Hey Ya!&lt;/i&gt; you&#39;ll go behind the scenes into the world of Big Boi and Andre 3000,  from their start as teenage hopefuls in Atlanta to their international rise to fame. Along the way you&#39;ll learn about the creative forces that have kept them on the cutting edge of hip-hop for a decade, and keep them pushing forward into tomorrow. From their first breakthrough with &quot;Player&#39;s Ball&quot; to their six Grammy wins, their upcoming movie and more, &lt;i&gt;Hey Ya!&lt;/i&gt; Is the ultimate look at two of the most creative forces in music today and is the definitive guide to everything OutKast!&lt;/p&gt;" />
