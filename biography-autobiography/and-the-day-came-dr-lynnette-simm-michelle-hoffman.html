  <title>And the Day Came - Dr. Lynnette Simm, Michelle Hoffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you read this book, you will discover a girl abandoned and abused. As an adult, in her struggles, she begins therapy and lets God take control. She learns to heal, rebuild relationships, and proves that nothing is unforgivable. There is more to life than just surviving abuse. Healing is possible with the Lord. Life abundantly is waiting for all. &lt;br /&gt;
...it wasnt until she embraced Jesus Christ did she feel worthy of being loved, and her true healing became embedded in her soul. &lt;br /&gt;
Linda Heyes, M.S., MFT&lt;br /&gt;
...this story is a tribute to not only individual resiliency, but shines a light on how we need each other to navigate the waters of recovery. ...we can find firm footing in the tangible and intangible resources found only through loving relationships.&lt;br /&gt;
Kimberly I. Fielding, Ed.D., LCSW&lt;br /&gt;
It takes divine courage to find the depth of honesty it takes to write a book such as this one. Lynnettes story allows you to walk with her through her journey as painful secrets hidden in the shadows are exposed to the light of Christ. My hope is that her words will lead you to the hope and healing she has found.&lt;br /&gt;
