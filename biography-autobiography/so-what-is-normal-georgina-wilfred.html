  <title>So, What Is Normal? - Georgina Wilfred</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Georgie&#39;s humourous portrayal of her life as a single parent, raising two children, one with Aspergers Syndrome (autism) and her fight to get her son&#39;s diagnosis - battling with smug educationalists who insisted the child was just lazy.  How after a long uphill struggle to get help and recognition, finding every cloud has a silver lining when Nicky is diagnosed as bordering on genius.  She later goes on to discuss his bizarre behaviour, his humour and eccentricities.  Digging deeper into the family for a possible genetic/hereditary link, Georgie&#39;s humourous look at her colourful family and friends, not to mention thieving ex-husbands, cheating boyfriends, no-one is excluded. Even Ellwood Blues the dog that ran off with her Xmas turkey and disgraced himself.  Told in Georgie&#39;s northern gritty humour, this is a refreshingly honest account of her life so far, and the rollercoaster of emotion she&#39;d found herself on." />
