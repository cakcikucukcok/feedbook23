  <title>Dare Not Linger - Mandla Langa, Nelson Mandela, Graça Machel, Graça Machel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The long-awaited second volume of Nelson Mandela&#39;s memoirs, left unfinished at his death and never before available, are here completed and expanded with notes and speeches written by Mandela during his historic presidency, making for a moving sequel to his worldwide bestseller &lt;i&gt;Long Walk to Freedom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not ended.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1994, Nelson Mandela became the first president of a democratic South Africa. From the outset, he was committed to serving only a single five-year term. During his presidency, he and his government ensured that all of South Africa&#39;s citizens became equal before the law, and he laid the foundation for turning a country riven by centuries of colonialism and apartheid into a fully functioning democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dare Not Linger&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Mandela&#39;s presidential years, drawing heavily on the memoir he began to write as he prepared to leave office, but was unable to finish. Now the acclaimed South African writer Mandla Langa has completed the task, using Mandela&#39;s unfinished draft, detailed notes that Mandela made as events were unfolding, and a wealth of unseen archival material. With a prologue by Mandela&#39;s widow, Graça Machel, the result is a vivid and often inspirational account of Mandela&#39;s presidency and the creation of a new democracy. It tells the story of a country in transition and the challenges Mandela faced as he strove to make his vision for a liberated South Africa a reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
