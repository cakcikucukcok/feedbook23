  <title>Joy During the Journey - Bud Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author was just your average guy trying to make a living and at the same time have a family he could be proud of. But like so many other men, things didnt work out the way he imagined. He found while he was successful in business, he was a failure in marriage relationship. Since this failure was unacceptable to him, he set out to find a way to be better at relationships. Along the way he discovered God and accepted Jesus Christ as his Savior. He also married a girl who was willing to be patient while he learned from God. For a lot of people the story couldve ended right there, but for the author he wanted more than just a church membership. Because of his wanting more, and his appetite for investigation, which he used in his business. The Holy Spirit saw this as an opportunity to take the author on a journey of discovery. As the book unfolds the author has incidents that happened in his life defying the laws of coincidences, and so slowly, so ever slowly, the author starts admitting to himself God is in charge, and is taking him on a journey. Each step of the journey has been orchestrated to teach the author a specific lesson he will use in later years. Each of these steps the author has put into a separate chapter, because each of these steps was an unexpected surprise to the author.&lt;/p&gt;" />
