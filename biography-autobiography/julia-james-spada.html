  <title>Julia - James Spada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Julia Roberts represents a return to the glamour of the great Hollywood stars of another era.  Fans flock to her movies, and she&#39;s a staple cover subject of &lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt; magazine and every entertainment show imaginable, but her real life has only been seen in tabloid glimpses until now. James Spada has gone back to Julia&#39;s beginnings in Athens, Georgia to unearth fascinating facts about her family and her early dating life.  And he&#39;s followed her career from movie to movie-both on screen and behind the screen-to show fans what the private face of Julia really is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an artist, Julia has changed dramatically from the talented but sheltered girl who found fame first with a role in the independent movie &quot;Mystic Pizza&quot; and became the exuberant star whose &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; delighted audiences everywhere before becoming an Oscar-winning actress capable of taking on the toughest roles.  As a person, she&#39;s grown from a skittish and gangly girl moving through relationships with co-stars to become an assured woman making her own bold decisions about how to live her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Julia&lt;/i&gt; will delight fans with its level of detail and fresh information, as well as its thoughtfulness about the life and career of a truly vibrant and complex star.&lt;/p&gt;" />
