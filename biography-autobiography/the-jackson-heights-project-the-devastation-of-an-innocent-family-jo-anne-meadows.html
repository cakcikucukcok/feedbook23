  <title>The Jackson Heights Project: the Devastation of an Innocent Family - Jo Anne Meadows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In The Jackson Heights Project, author Jo Anne Meadows pours out her heart about her struggles, trauma, and unforgettable experiences of her life and the life of her late dad. Throughout this memoir, Jo Anne shares what happened to her and her family as a result of living with an alcoholic and abusive dad. Her family was torn apart due to her dads illness and by certain people who were envious of him and a negative influence in his life. Jo Anne decided to write, and she titled her book The Jackson Heights Project because this is where she lived and grew up with her mom, dad, and seven siblings during the good and bad times of their lives. She regrets the life her family had after her dad started drinking and physically abusing her mom who did not deserve this type of treatment. Jo Annes dad was a hard worker, however, and was well known as a great gospel singer in the group the Valley Spiritual Singers. Jo Anne believes her dad would have had a great future with his gospel career if he had not started drinking. One day while performing at a gig, one of the greatest gospel groups of all-time the Mighty Clouds of Joy heard him sing and asked him to come join their group. He declined and gave up on everything he worked so hard for as his life fell into a downward spiral. In The Jackson Heights Project, readers will discover how this family managed to deal with the negative effects of alcoholism and what their lives were like after their various experiences of the devastation as an innocent family. Jo Anne currently resides in Los Angeles, California, with a family of her own and is still healing from her past. Sharing her story in the pages of this book has been very therapeutic. She dedicates this book to her late dad, Mr. Joseph Joe Meadows Sr. (April 1, 1936November 4, 1983)." />
