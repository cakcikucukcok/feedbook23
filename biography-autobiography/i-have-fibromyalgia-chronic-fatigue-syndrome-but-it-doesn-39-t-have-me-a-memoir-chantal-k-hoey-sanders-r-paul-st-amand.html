You are NOT alone! You CAN change your life and REVERSE this highly frustrating, emotionally confusing, very often unrecognized invisible illness.

Abandoned and misunderstood by their families, the medical community, and society in general, they retreat to their medicine cabinets full of prescription drugs and supplementsmere bandagesthat wont reverse their condition.

Part memoir/part self-help, Chantal chronicles the steps she took to reclaim her life while following the Guaifenesin
Treatment Protocol.
Join Chantal in her journey.

 Kris Bruinsma, FMS survivor
I am so proud to read this book written by my friend, Chantal. Her articles have graced many publications including my own and I am thrilled that she has taken the time to make her story public. I know firsthand the power of shared experiences on recovery and know her book will make a difference to so many.
Claudia Marek, co-author of What Your Doctor May Not Tell You about Fibromyalgia
Th is is a story of hope and determination written by an individual who has been a patient in my integrative medical practice for the past eight years. She is an outspoken advocate and our resident expert in the protocol of R. Paul St. Amand, MD. She has graced us with her knowledge and exuberant energy at our clinics monthly fibromyalgia support
group meetings. She is the consummate teacher and is always available to help our other fibromyalgia patients working through the subtleties of the Guaifenesin Protocol. A must-read for anyone lost in the abyss of fibromyalgia with seemingly no apparent way out.&quot;
