  <title>You Will - Memoirs of a Loving Father: While Unknowingly Embarking On His Epic Journey Towards Growth - Frank J Melero Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;You Will&quot; started as a set of memoirs for my two children during a very dark time in my life. Yes, my story started within my tribe but as time passed, I realized that it was for more than just us. Sure, my book is entrenched in angst, painful memories and my wrestling with questions about the great unknown. But it&#39;s more about the realization that love, grace and hope never die - ever. It&#39;s about removing our blinders and choosing to see things for ourselves. It&#39;s about how we all fall, but we can also all get back up. This is me finally listening and choosing that I can be a part of helping others do just that, even if via my own thorns and scars.  This story isn&#39;t only about telling people my story. It&#39;s an open invitation. It&#39;s me inviting them to share their story with the world too. You&#39;re not alone, not even close. We are all called for greatness. This is my attempt to shine a light on the fact that we&#39;re not done yet. We can all grow. We just got started.  Feel free to sing along..." />
