  <title>My Groupon Adventure - Max Dickins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2013, comedian Max Dickins wasn&#39;t sure of very much in life, but he did know one thing for certain: his life was excruciatingly and mind-numbingly boring. He was heartbroken and desperate to shake things up. That&#39;s when he found Groupon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What started as a gateway to some new experiences snowballed into a limitless Narnia of discounted possibility. His insatiable desire to try out new experiences was accompanied by only one rule: he wasn&#39;t allowed to turn anything down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of 18 months, Max did a new Groupon deal every week, charting his experiences along the way: he changed his name, became a Lord, moonlighted as a beekeeper, trekked with alpacas, underwent a colonic irrigation and ultrasound scan, and even convinced Groupon to sell a date with him on their site. They sold 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From a deep rut, he emerged a better man, resuscitated by the oxygen of new experience. &lt;i&gt;My Groupon Adventure &lt;/i&gt;is a hilarious and uplifting account of these experiences and what can happen when you inject a healthy dose of spontaneity into your life. It&#39;s a book about opening yourself - and sometimes parts of your body - up to new experiences, and ultimately choosing the life you want for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
