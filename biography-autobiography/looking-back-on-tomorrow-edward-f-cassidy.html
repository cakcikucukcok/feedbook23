  <title>Looking Back on Tomorrow - Edward F. Cassidy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Looking Back on Tomorrow is a Life Story filled with the personal memories and recollections of the author. Within each of the early chapters, the author captures his emotions and strongest feelings - collected and compiled during the many years he lived in Brooklyn, New York City and later in New Yorks Catskill Mountains. Covering this time span, the author manages to express his observations and experiences in verse of great depth, impact and insight. These are used as a foundation with which he looks forward and makes some stark predictions about what tomorrow may hold in store - both for himself as well as for his loved ones. In this book, the authors everyday life amongst his closest family and friends was used as the basis for numerous international misadventures. These tales are not only fascinating and pleasurable to read, but are guaranteed to make the reader deeply reflect. In fact, some may find themselves laughing out loud at one escapade while tearing-up at another - sometimes even doing both simultaneously! It is a remarkable book for people of all ages and genres; it has a timeless appeal that is both enjoyable and unforgettable." />
