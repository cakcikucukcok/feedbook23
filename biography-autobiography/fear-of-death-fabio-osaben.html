  <title>Fear of Death - Fabio Osaben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="1. In recounting these escapades, both as a young boy in my native Trieste and later in the United States and while traveling over half this world, I became aware of the place love has in the ever present cycle of life and death, that one never looks at, and, how religion, control, fear, pleasure and joy contribute to this understanding.
2. Do you remember being here before? Have you been here all along but you don&#39;t remember.        How to remember, or better, what is the quality of the mind that asks this question?
3. I live in New York, studied aerospace technology and voice, was a member of the Met Studio, sang opera and concerts, off-Broadway and later concentrated on night clubs.  I traveled extensively throughout the world, was a director on the largest cruise companies in the world, hotels and various resorts.  I enjoy life, value my relationships and my three sons all involved in the arts." />
