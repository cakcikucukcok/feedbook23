  <title>I Have A Voice - Tyler Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Finding and fortifying our voices is so powerful. It awakens what once was sleeping. It strengthens what once was weak. And it inspires all of us into action.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tyler Williams has known success. He has performed in Atlanta&amp;#39;s famed Fox Theatre, raced down Victory Lane as a NASCAR driver, worked on hit film and TV shows, and sang for thousands in packed arenas. But Tyler has also known failure, devastating setbacks, and the pain of lost love. He knows how it feels to be lost, disconnected from himself and his passion.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tyler tells his story of losing his &amp;quot;voice,&amp;quot; navigating life for many years without it, then finding it again&amp;mdash;and finding himself in the process. &amp;quot;I Have a Voice&amp;quot; is full of life lessons that people both young and old will recognize. This is a book of hope, challenges and breakthrough moments. Tyler recounts his personal journey and uses his experience to help guide readers back to their own voices without dictating the steps to get there. Those who have lost their purpose, passion and &amp;quot;voice&amp;quot; will find renewal in his words.&lt;/p&gt;" />
