  <title>Meant To Be - Walter Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Published to strong reviews and major media attention, this heartfelt and inspirational rags-to-riches memoir by the highly regarded CEO of Parade Publications tells the emotional story of how he came to terms with an identity and a family that he never knew he had until he reached middle age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meant To Be&lt;/em&gt; begins when Anderson, a 21-year-old Marine returns from service to say goodbye to his dying father and tries to find the answer to a question that has inexplicably haunted him from his earliest years: Was the alcoholic, abusive man who has so tormented him in his childhood his real father? Shockingly, the answer turns out to be &quot;No.&quot; Unbeknown to him, at least until that point, his mother, a German Protestant, fell in love during World War II with a Russian Jew and bore his child. Anderson learns this information as a young man but he and his mother keep this secret for another 35 years, until the day Anderson&amp;#8212;now an unusually successful publishing executive&amp;#8212;meets an unknown brother who, it turns out, has lived a nearly parallel life. &lt;em&gt;Meant To Be&lt;/em&gt; is a love story, a journey of self-discovery and spirituality, and a provocative challenge to common notions about the role of heredity in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
