  <title>Summertime Dreams - Dolly Niemic Konwinski, Douglas Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most young girls never dream of becoming a professional baseball player and very few ever do. But for Dolly Niemiec Konwinski, baseball was her passion, and her biggest dream came true when she signed her first professional contract while she was still in high school! 
    In her autobiography,Summertime Dreams, Yes - Girls Can Play Baseball! Dolly shares the excitement of traveling across the country on a barnstorming tour, being called up to the big league and having to battle each season for a spot in the AAGPBL play-offs.
    Even after a horrific career-ending accident, baseball has continued to be one of the highlights of her life, leading her to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988 and to spot in the 1992 classic motion picture, A League of Their Own. From roller-skating as a schoolgirl in Chicago, to pro baseball, and on to a National Championship in Match Team Bowling, Dolly has managed to cram an incredible number of personal accomplishments into just one lifetime. As her story points out, she attained her goals through perseverance and by never taking &quot;no&quot; for an answer, and it&#39;s been these same values and ideals that have been so vital in her own personal game plan for success. 
    Summertime Dreams is a lot more than just another book about baseball. It&#39;s a story of love, family, disappointment, hard work and dedication... all the things that help make dreams come true. It&#39;s a sure bet to entertain and inspire readers of all ages." />
