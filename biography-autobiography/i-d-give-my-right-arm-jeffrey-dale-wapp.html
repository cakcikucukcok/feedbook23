  <title>I’D Give My Right Arm - Jeffrey Dale Wapp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a true story of the horrific impact an inadvertent use of an addictive drug had on my life over the period of nearly half a century. My story will provide insight into the life of an addict such as you&#39;ve never before seen. The reason I&#39;m confident you&#39;ve never read a book such as this is because people who do the things I&#39;ve done don&#39;t live to tell about them. Only by cheating death more times than any man has a right to have I remained alive long enough to be able tell the complete story of what addiction can do over the course of an entire lifetime. My personal experience and exposure to murder, disease, betrayal, amputation, and immeasurable loss of life will surely make you think of what can happen if you decide to try an addictive drug. My hope is that whosoever reads this will wisely take heed and not repeat the mistakes I&#39;ve made. 
I wrote it to all audiences and especially believe it should be read by every teenager in America." />
