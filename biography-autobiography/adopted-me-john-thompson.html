  <title>Adopted – Me? - John Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the age of 43, during my divorce and a child custody battle, I found
out I had been adopted. Shock and disbelief changed to a gradual urge
to seek out my natural parents. Years later, I eventually found my mother
hidden in a fairy-tale castle in the forest. Thats what it seemed at the
time. This then led to a sister, three brothers, a father, and an even
larger family of cousins and their offspring. The next thirty years were
a mixture of joy, relief, happiness, and fun whilst forging a new life
for myself. Later, I experienced sadness, despair, and tragedy whilst
helping to alleviate my birth mothers mental illness and caring for
and losing four parents. I uncovered a dramatic 1930s love affair and
700 years of family genealogy with high-ranking seventeenth-century
offi cials from the Church of England. I also discovered more about my
birth father, a World War II RAF fighter pilot who nearly ended up
being shot, escaping from Stalag Luft III, who owned a leading sock
manufacturing company in the United Kingdom, run by the family
since 1882. On the family tree, I found Victor Borge, the famous
concert pianist and stand-up comedian. Finding my new family has
been a very happy, rewarding, and interesting part of my life." />
