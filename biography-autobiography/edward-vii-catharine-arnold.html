  <title>Edward VII - Catharine Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Victorian England: We know what that was supposed to mean -- all priggish prudery and &quot;we-are-not-amused&quot; harrumphing. Except now we know it wasn&#39;t all that . . . [Catharine Arnold&#39;s] new biography focuses -- deliciously -- on the women who shared the scandalously plentiful sex life of Queen Victoria&#39;s eldest son, the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII.&quot; --&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;USA Today&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edward Prince of Wales, better known as &quot;Bertie,&quot; was the eldest son of Queen Victoria. Charming and dissolute, he was a larger-than-life personality with king-size appetites. A lifelong womanizer, Bertie conducted his countless liaisons against the glittering backdrop of London society, Europe, and the stately homes of England in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bertie&#39;s lovers were beautiful, spirited, society women who embraced a wide field of occupations. There was Lillie Langtry, the simple Jersey girl who would become an actress and producer; &quot;Daisy&quot; Brooke, Countess of Warwick, the extravagant socialite who embraced socialism and stood for Parliament as a Labour party candidate; bisexual French actress Sarah Bernhardt, celebrated for her decadent appeal and opium habit; and by total contrast the starchy Agnes Keyser, who founded a hospital for army officers. One of Bertie&#39;s most intriguing liaisons was with American heiress Jennie Churchill, unhappy wife of Sir Randolph Churchill and mother of Sir Winston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the scandals resulting from his affairs--from suicides to divorces--were a blight on the royal family, Bertie would become a surprisingly modern monarch. His major accomplishment was transforming the British monarchy into the modern institution that we know today and ensuring its survival in a period when every other European dynasty collapsed in the wake of WWI.&lt;/p&gt;" />
