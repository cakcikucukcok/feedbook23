  <title>Invariable Snow for the Eskimo … - B. Johnny Way</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From his birth in August of 1956 until early 1960, author B. Johnny Way lived a pretty normal life, during which time he tried his best to understand the simplest of childhood complexities. And then, somewhere around his fourth birthday, he began to change. In Invariable Snow for the Eskimo, Way shares the account of his early life that included living for almost twenty-four months on Kodiak Island.
Way narrates a variety of adventures and experiences including the joys of slicing and gliding around on a huge sheet of ice atop a frozen Alaskan lake, witnessing firsthand the larger-than-life, scary-looking sea creatures from the icy-cold waters of the Gulf of Alaska, and fishing for sockeye salmon in one of the many streams and rivers of Alaska with his homemade fishing pole, made from the wood of a kids toy kite.
Invariable Snow for the Eskimo discusses how, Way, as a youngster, quickly learned that helping others was more advantageous and rewarding than first thought and that sharing your time, patience, and knowledge with friends as well as strangers is better than any other kind of reward." />
