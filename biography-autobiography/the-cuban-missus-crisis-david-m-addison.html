  <title>The Cuban Missus Crisis - David M. Addison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this humorous travelogue round Cuba, the hapless author suffers from both urban myths and his Missus (aka the Drinks Police). The first he debunks as they occur; the crises his Missus causes, or would have caused but for his timely intervention, are a more serious matter.
Acutely aware that Cuba is certain to change in the near future and probably radically, award-winning author David M. Addison was anxious to experience the country as it is now, under communism and Castro. Apart from describing what daily life is like for ordinary Cubans, he also delves into Cubas past  from the original inhabitants and post-Columbian conquest to the Wars of Independence and the Bay of Pigs and its aftermath.
On the literary trail, Addison pays homage to Hemingway as he follows in his footsteps. And if that should necessitate a visit to a bar or two, that cant be helped. Its not a lame excuse for a bar crawl despite what the Drinks Police may think.
It goes without saying that in Cuba you cant avoid classic cars and cigars but the author also takes a close look at Cubas art and architecture, flora and fauna and not least, the countrys other most famous product  rum. Another cause for a crisis as far as the Missus is concerned.
A mine on all aspects of Cuban culture both past and present, this is useful background reading for anyone intending a visit to Cuba as well as being a handy accompaniment to your guidebook when you go. Or, if armchair travelling is more your thing, pour yourself a glass of rum or mix a mojito and learn and laugh your way round Cuba." />
