  <title>America&#39;s Mom: The Life, Letters, and Legacy of Ann Lan - Rick Kogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For two generations of Americans, reading Ann Landers&#39;s daily column was as important as eating breakfast. For nearly fifty years an entire nation turned to this quick-witted, worldly-wise counselor for advice on everything from dinner etiquette to sex. But who was the woman behind the byline?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iowa-born Eppie Lederer was first hired by the &lt;em&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/em&gt; to take over the daily advice column in 1955 -- and over the next half-century she helped shape the nation&#39;s social and sexual landscape. Award-winning journalist Rick Kogan was Ann Landers&#39;s last editor and close friend, and he paints a fascinating, full-bodied account of the triumphs, the wisdom, the courage, and the trials of one of the twentieth century&#39;s most enduring icons -- including her painful lifelong feud with her identical twin sister, &quot;Dear Abby&quot;; her stubborn refusal to shy away from even the most controversial topics; and the tragic breakup of her own thirty-six-year marriage.  Filled with remarkable stories shared by people from all walks of life who were profoundly affected by the good sense and guidance of Ann Landers, &lt;em&gt;America&#39;s Mom&lt;/em&gt; is a moving tribute to a singular woman who has earned an eternal place in our culture ... and our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
