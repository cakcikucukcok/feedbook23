  <title>The Saboteur - Paul Kix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the tradition of &lt;em&gt;Agent Zigzag&lt;/em&gt; comes this breathtaking biography, as fast-paced and emotionally intuitive as the very best spy thrillers, which illuminates an unsung hero of the French Resistance during World War II&amp;#8212;Robert de La Rochefoucald, an aristocrat turned anti-Nazi saboteur&amp;#8212;and his daring exploits as a &lt;em&gt;r&amp;#233;sistant &lt;/em&gt;trained by Britain&amp;#8217;s Special Operations Executive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A scion of one of the most storied families in France, Robert de La Rochefoucald was raised in magnificent chateaux and educated in Europe&#39;s finest schools. When the Nazis invaded and imprisoned his father, La Rochefoucald escaped to England and learned the dark arts of anarchy and combat&amp;#8212;cracking safes and planting bombs and killing with his bare hands&amp;#8212;from the officers of Special Operations Executive, the collection of British spies, beloved by Winston Churchill, who altered the war in Europe with tactics that earned it notoriety as the &amp;#8220;Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare.&amp;#8221; With his newfound skills, La Rochefoucauld returned to France and organized Resistance cells, blew up fortified compounds and munitions factories, interfered with Germans&amp;#8217; war-time missions, and executed Nazi officers. Caught by the Germans, La Rochefoucald withstood months of torture without cracking, and escaped his own death, not once but twice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Saboteur &lt;/em&gt;recounts La Rochefoucauld&amp;#8217;s enthralling adventures, from jumping from a moving truck on his way to his execution to stealing Nazi limos to dressing up in a nun&amp;#8217;s habit&amp;#8212;one of his many disguises and impersonations. Whatever the mission, whatever the dire circumstance, La Rochefoucauld acquitted himself nobly, with the straight-back aplomb of a man of aristocratic breeding: James Bond before Ian Fleming conjured him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than just a fast-paced, true thriller, &lt;em&gt;The Saboteur&lt;/em&gt; is also a deep dive into an endlessly fascinating historical moment, telling the untold story of a network of commandos that battled evil, bravely worked to change the course of history, and inspired the creation of America&amp;#8217;s own Central Intelligence Agency. &lt;/p&gt;" />
