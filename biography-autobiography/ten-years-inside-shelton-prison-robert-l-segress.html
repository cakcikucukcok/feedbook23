  <title>Ten Years Inside Shelton Prison - Robert L. Segress</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ten Years inside Shelton Prison is a moving picture that captures what happens inside a prison. Shocking evil and joyful healings live together side by side where the Gospel goes successfully. A guard being stabbed to death with a ballpoint pen during a chapel service stands next to tears of joy running down the face of a Russian mafia member when he was born again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert walked into Shelton prison for the first time. As he walked past fences that were covered with razor wire blindingly reflecting the harsh sun, he was afraid. Iron gates slammed behind him. Guards were unaware of his trembling hands. Men in orange suits began to watch him. There was no place to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the beginning of ten years in Shelton prison, where the author served the Lord. There were great blessings: fearful faces accepted the Lord Jesus and became new creatures in Christ. There were dangerous moments: an inmate cut Robert, forcing him to go through AIDS testing. Yet he also had a prisoners scarred head laid on his shoulder, who after accepting Jesus smiled at him and said, I needed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controlling purpose of Ten Years is to present the four biblical steps to freedom from incarceration, whether inside a prison or addicted outside of a prison. The four parts of this graphic book are: imprisoned, instruction, health, and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book concludes with two appendices on important subjects: Learning How to Resist the Devil and a famous therapy for treating addictions, Family of Origin Therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the appendices, thirty-three itemized summaries or compendia are given with the reference pages included. Also, there are referenced sites for ten of Roberts poems that are included in this prison journey log.&lt;br /&gt;
