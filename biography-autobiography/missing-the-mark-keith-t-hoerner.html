  <title>Missing the Mark - Keith T. Hoerner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the NEW 2nd edition. The 1st edition ranked 4.8 out of 5 stars while on Amazon for 2 1/2 years. 
&lt;p&gt;According to reader/reviewer Linda Briggs-Harty, &quot;This is the best treatment of child abuse I&#39;ve seen... The writing is rich, descriptive, fluent, emotionally imbued but spare and authentic. [The] voice in the book, in particular, moves me beyond words.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
According to reader/reviewer N.R., &quot;I finally had time tonight and read your new edition. I&#39;ve read your book three times in the past two years, all at different moments when I needed it. And you know what makes yours different from all the other books about child abuse, alcoholism, and mental illness? It&#39;s motivating! Not in the cheesy kind of way where it leaves you a few weeks after you&#39;ve read it, but in a way where the words always seem to stay with you. And it&#39;s funny  because each time, I get something new from it. I won&#39;t bore you with the details, but I do want you to know that I have been praying for two months for a sign over a personal matter, and you&#39;re new edition was definitely it and has helped heal those wounds and address a lot of the uncertainties that came with it. I think its amazing how youre able to influence and touch so many different people  all suffering from various issues  in less than 200 pages. Its simply incredible!&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Back of Cover:&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movement in Missing the Mark is a series of vignettes or jump cuts, similar to modern cinematic technique, exemplifying the fact that chaotic stories often have an absence of smooth transition and order.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the text The Wounded Storyteller, this creative nonfiction witness recounts a dysfunctional upbringing within the structure of what Arthur W. Frank purports as The Chaos Narrative.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Author Keith Hoerner writes this piece to reclaim himself, to find his voice from beneath an antagonist who made him mute. Surprisingly, in reshaping the fractured pieces of his so-called life, he also discovers the existence of varied selves along the way (not only the ever-present lover but the admitted hater), which he has too long denied.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;After forty-nine years, he is now able to recognize love and hate can coexist as counter selves in the human heart. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Keith [Hoerner] shows skill, control, and sensitivity to language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Michael Castro, PhD,&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Author of The Bush Years&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most unflinchingly honest and beautiful theses Id ever read.&lt;/p&gt;
