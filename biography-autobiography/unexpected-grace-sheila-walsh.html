  <title>Unexpected Grace - Sheila Walsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;When Eleanor Pfaehler and I met, we stood on opposite sides of an invisible, and seemingly insurmountable, wall,&quot; Sheila Walsh writes. &quot;Eleanor and I talked over this wall. At times we reached up to hug. But the wall was always there.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;Then Eleanor was diagnosed with liver cancer. Finally, by the grace and mercy of God alone, the wall came crashing down. Eleanor and I found ourselves swimming in the river of mercy with our arms around each other, holding each other, willing to give our lives for each other.&quot;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Unexpected Grace&lt;/I&gt; is a tender account of the relationship between a mother and daughter-in-law and how they discovered extravagant grace in the midst of what could have been the most tragic experience of their lives. Their story will encourage you and help you see how God can bring good out of even the bleakest circumstances.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Previously published as &lt;I&gt;Stories from the River of Mercy.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
