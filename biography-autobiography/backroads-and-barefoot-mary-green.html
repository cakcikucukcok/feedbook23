  <title>Backroads and Barefoot - Mary Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life leaves us with so many questions. Why did I go through that? What was the purpose? Why is life so unfair? We can get so caught up on asking the questions that we never hear the answers. I looked back at my life and realized I wasted a lot of time traveling back roads looking for answers. Answer&#39;s that could only be found in Jesus, answer&#39;s He was providing along my journey I just couldn&#39;t hear Him. I allowed the darkness of those back roads to completely consume me. Today, I have come off those roads and I found all the answer&#39;s I will ever need in Jesus. That is why I want to &quot;bare&quot; all and share with you how Jesus can change your circumstances and take you off the back roads of life and onto His Devine Path." />
