  <title>Masterji - Sewa Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Masterji, Nathu, was born in the tiny village of Narangwal
in the early twentieth century. His Sansi caste was declared a
so-called Criminal Tribe by the British. They were forced to
steal or beg for food, money and clothes. As a Sansi, he lived on
the outermost fringes of the society being an untouchable.With
the British ruling India and the iron-clad caste system ??irmly in
place, he could not have anticipated much more than herding
other peoples buffaloes for a living. But by sheer chance, little
Nathu was admitted to the local government school. And it
changed his life forever. However, the immense struggle that
lay ahead of him was only just beginning.
This is the story of Nathus incredible journey toward becoming
Natha Singh, respected school teacher. The story, told in his own
voice, relies on his stupendous memory to recall even minor
incidents in his long and eventful life. Filled with descriptions
and anecdotes, it paints many unforgettable scenes, and
the narration tinged with a dry sense of humour makes for
delightful reading.
This inspiring and moving saga of courage, perseverance, and
sterling integrity is rich in personal, historical and sociological
detail. Natha Singhs lifelong ??ight, for dignity and against the
cruel caste system, is all too relevant in 21st century India.
