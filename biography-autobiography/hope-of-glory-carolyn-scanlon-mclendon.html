  <title>Hope of Glory - Carolyn Scanlon McLendon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hope of Glory takes us to the Deep South where social and political mores rule over laws and where descendants of slaves may not be socially equal, but they are not socially inferior. Its about a Southern white newspaper editor who believes in and does, regardless of cost, what he can to ensure equal rights for all. He marries a Southern lady, the younger sister of a US senator, whose social, political, and family position give him power in the choice of governor, a man the editor considers politically dangerous. As expected, the senator uses his sister to try to control the editor. Add the death threat to the visit of northern racist to the killing of the editors father and damage to the editors home, and you have dissention between the editor and his wife. Woven throughout the story is insight into how blacks melded their lives into the Deep South by using what their ancestors brought from Africa. And all this story was written by a Southern lady who spent eighty years observing it firsthand." />
