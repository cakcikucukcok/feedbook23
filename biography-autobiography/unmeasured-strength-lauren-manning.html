  <title>Unmeasured Strength - Lauren Manning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this update to the 2011 New York Times Bestselling book, the reader will find:&lt;br&gt;o         Timely new information about Manning&#39;s struggles within the healthcare system&lt;br&gt;o         Additional details about the author&#39;s childhood&lt;br&gt;o         And an emotional new essay from the author about her father, who died shortly after the book&#39;s publication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A survivor&#39;s awe-inspiring story of how she overcame tragedy and re-created herself as a wife, mother, and woman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was a hardworking business woman, had a loving husband and an infant son, and a confidence born of intelligence and beauty. But on 9/11, good fortune was no match for catastrophe. When a wall of flame at the World Trade Center burned more than 80 percent of her body, Lauren Manning began a ten-year journey of survival and rebirth that tested her almost beyond human endurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long before that infamous September day, Manning learned the importance of perseverance, relentless hard work, and a deep faith in oneself. So when the horrific moment of her near-death arrived, she possessed the strength and resilience to insist that she would not yield--not to the terrorists, not to the long odds, not to the bottomless pain and exhaustion. But as the difficult months and years went by, she came to understand that she had to do more than survive. She needed to undergo a complete transformation, one that would allow her to embrace her life and her loved ones in an entirely new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleeing the burning tower, Manning promised herself that she would see her son&#39;s face again. Courageous and inspiring, &lt;i&gt;Unmeasured Strength&lt;/i&gt; tells the riveting story of her heroic effort to make that miracle--and so many others--possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
