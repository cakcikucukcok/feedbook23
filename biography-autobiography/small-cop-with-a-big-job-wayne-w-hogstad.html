      <meta name="description" content="My military career started 22 June 1965, went through basic training at Lackland Air Force base Texas for six weeks. After basic was sent to Turner Air Force Base, Albany, Georgia on august 16 1965 a SAC base with B-52 and KC-135 on alert status, guarding these planes was part of my AIR POLICE duties. Security duty ended at Turner when I went to Kadena AIR BASE OKINAWA in April 1966 for four months TDY until August 1 1966. 
I flew back to Turner and all security that I did was Munitions storage, and watching Munitions people taking nuclear weapons out of igloos to put on planes, for transport to other SAC base for storage. Turner nuclear mission was phasing out, In November 1966, I got orders for a base in Thailand. March 1967 went home on leave and in April went to Travis Air FORCE to board a commercial flight for Bangkok, Thailand, after a 28 hour flight landed at Don Maung airport in Bangkok. After a overnight stay went to DonMaung airport to board a C-130 transport upcountry after several stops to Nahkom Phanom ROYAL THAI AIR BASE ON April 07 1967 for a one year tour of duty as a cop. This year was the most interesting time I ever experienced in the AIR FORCE as a cop. always something going on, as you will read in this book. April 1968 left NKP to go home to Blue Earth. MN for leave, the to Minot AIR force base at Minot , North Dakota, My security work was Minute Man 2 Missile. April 1968 started my time working as cop until December 09 1968, I got my release from active duty to go back home, a six months early out of the Air Force." />
