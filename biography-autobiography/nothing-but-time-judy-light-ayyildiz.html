  <title>Nothing but Time - Judy Light Ayyildiz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Our great author of CATCH 22, Joseph Heller, told of his experience with Guillain-Barre in NO LAUGHING MATTER. Now Judy Light Ayyildiz equals--and in some ways surpasses--his account in her book, Nothing but Time.&quot; 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;--Walter James Miller&lt;br&gt;
author, co-author, or editor of 67 books and LOVES MAINLAND&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;This book is truly an inspiration for anyone who has ever run into a brick wall in life.&quot; 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;--Simone Poirier-Bures, &lt;br&gt;
author of three memoirs including, CANDYMAN.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;...interesting and well-written...great job of interspersing personal vignettes...purchase copy for...neurology house staff library and also for chaplains office...insightful for health care workers dealing with GBS patients--perhaps especially nurses, P.T.s etc.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;--Dr. James Q. Miller, &lt;br&gt;
Prof. Neurology, Univ. VA Medical Center.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   Judys body is tricked by a virus into attacking itself. She wakes up paralyzed. Her creative mind fights back with the themes and spirit in the stories of her life. Armed with insight gleaned from her own stories about events and people in her past and present both in Turkey and the US, and told with restrained humor and often with Appalachian flavor -- Judy discovers that her spiritual desire to &quot;walk&quot; is stronger than the fear of &quot;falling.&quot;
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    &quot;Throughout, the reader feels like an intimate friend....Her sudden immobility motivates her to look for meaning in this unexpected crisis...caused when a virus tricks the bodys immune system into attacking itself...betrayal of an ememy within brings out a more relavant need for self-reflection, which Ayyildiz does in a gentle and insightful way. She relates memories of childhood, courtship, child raising and other life events revealing the interconnections within her life. NbT is a beautiful study of a womans psyche as she experiences great trauma and portrays how one can balance her own recovery with her responsibilities to her children and partner. With wonderful metaphors and a healthy dose of humor Judy engages the reader and turns a depressing situation into an inspiring story about courage in the face of a huge setback in life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;--Eser Turan, TURQUAZ MAGAZINE&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
   a compelling odyssey of lifes house of cards dealing with the hand dealtvery inspirational, terrificskillful style of looking back casting the net to bring the reader in to the psyche, the reality check of the present, the wary peering around the uncertain corner ahead with its capricious nature. The emotional detail throughout is what makes the book because its riveting honesty pulls the reader forward, encouraging understanding, its independent strength not necessarily seeking sympathy for its own sake.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;--Helen Canuk, DC&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;...a heartening book that takes you by the hand through a fearful landscape, and out onto the other side. The writing is often lyrical, the emerging, self-buoyant; but what I valued most is the unremitting honesty.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;--Bell Gale Chevigny
DOING TIME: 25 YEARS of PRISON WRITING, &lt;br&gt;
a PEN American Center prize anthology, NYC&lt;/i&gt;

&quot;...gripping.&lt;i&gt;&quot;Donna Miles,Toronto,Canada &lt;/I&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A captivating testimony to the human spirit and the power of the collective self. Ayyildiz is living proof of the healing potential residing within everything we have known be it within ourselves or in and among the life we have shared with those around us.
