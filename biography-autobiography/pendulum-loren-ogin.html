  <title>Pendulum - Loren Ogin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book explores Bi Polar Mood Disorder and the symptoms of the disorder as well as coping with it. In it I also write about coming out of the closet as homosexual. The consequent discrimination and stigmatization I went through at the hands of one of the organizations I worked at is also discussed.
This book was cathartic for me to write as I was able to let go of the anger I felt towards the individuals at whose hands my dignity and self- esteem was destroyed and the struggle to get it back so I could become a whole person again. To be considered as a deviant in society is very difficult to deal with. I have found the strength to deal with it by surrounding myself with people who are also considered as deviant. 
The book also gives people who have Bi Polar Mood Disorder the information they need to understand their illness and how medication works, as well how to deal with the anger and behaviour which goes along with the disorder.
I hope that the information in the book is helpful to readers and their families and promotes understanding and acceptance instead of discrimination." />
