In this book, Ochitti shares his experience as a local opposition political novice in local grassroots elections. He shares stories of poverty, betrayal, intrigue, corruption, sex, and power in a local democracy.
While this vices in politics are not new to Ochitti; he is surprised at the extent to which these vices were practiced. Neither did Ochitti know what inspires these actions until he joined politics.
In this book, Ochitti uses fictional names of people and places to enable him to express himself freely according to what he experienced and intended to share with his readers.
Other than accountability to his electorates and supporters, the purpose of this book is to continue with Ochittis education campaign to encourage dialogue on the importance and role of education in his community.
The book also highlights the nature and level of corruption, intrigue, and betrayal in local electoral processes and how it challenges democracy and good governance in a poor country through the character of Cana and that of his colleagues." />
