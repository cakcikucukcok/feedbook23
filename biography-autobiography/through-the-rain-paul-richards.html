  <title>Through the Rain - Paul Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The news is often replete with horror stories of lost children, especially boys, who it seem are destined for failure by nothing more than the fact that they were born in an inner-city community. Through the Rain takes an open, honest look at an average boy from an average family who, in spite of the odds, makes it out of two such communities and makes a success of his life. The story is much about growing up as it is about family, friendship, and overcoming challenges in spite of the odds. However, it is mostly about hard work, perseverance, and what can happen when ordinary people choose to live lives of decency, courage, and faith. Told in a refreshingly candid and good-natured way, the author hopes his story will inspire those ordinary people whose stories unfortunately go untold." />
