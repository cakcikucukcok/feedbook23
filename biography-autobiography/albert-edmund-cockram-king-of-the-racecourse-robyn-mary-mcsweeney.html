  <title>ALBERT EDMUND COCKRAM: KING OF THE RACECOURSE - Robyn  Mary McSweeney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the amazing story of my great grandfather Albert Edmund Cockram who was, in his time, was the largest importer of Thoroughbred Racehorses into Australia from Europe and New Zealand.&amp;nbsp; The best blood lines that money could buy were purchased. In one year alone he bought in 150 horses from overseas by ship in the early part of the century.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He built and owned Belmont and Goodwood Racecourses in Perth.&amp;nbsp; His racing colours of Purple and Orange were renowned all over the Commonwealth.&amp;nbsp; His horses won major races throughout Australia, five Perth Cups, Epsom&amp;#39;s, three Sydney Cups, three Hannan&amp;#39;s Cups, Waverley, Railway Stakes, Villiers, to name but a few.&amp;nbsp; He was an inaugural member of Trotting in this State, a life member of W.A.T.A., a life member of W.A.T.C., President of the Merino&amp;nbsp; Breeders Association, Vice President of the Royal Agricultural Society.&amp;nbsp; He was owner and director of Griffin Coal and an entrepreneur in mining, racing and agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He funded the first expedition which explored the North West coastline from Broome to Derby and recognised the huge potential for agriculture and mineral wealth.&amp;nbsp; &amp;#39;The Cockram and Stuart Expedition&amp;#39; took a cinematographer with them to record the first pictures taken of that region. They then went to London trying to get investors to open up the North West.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book not only covers his life story and achievements but connects the first five families of mine that came to Western Australia from 1833.&lt;/p&gt;" />
