  <title>Updike - Adam Begley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updike&lt;/em&gt; is Adam Begley&amp;#8217;s masterful, much-anticipated biography of one of the most celebrated figures in American literature: Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Updike&amp;#8212;a candid, intimate, and richly detailed look at his life and work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this magisterial biography, Adam Begley offers an illuminating portrait of John Updike, the acclaimed novelist, poet, short-story writer, and critic who saw himself as a literary spy in small-town and suburban America, who dedicated himself to the task of transcribing &amp;#8220;middleness with all its grits, bumps and anonymities.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updike&lt;/em&gt; explores the stages of the writer&amp;#8217;s pilgrim&amp;#8217;s progress: his beloved home turf of Berks County, Pennsylvania; his escape to Harvard; his brief, busy working life as the golden boy at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;; his family years in suburban Ipswich, Massachusetts; his extensive travel abroad; and his retreat to another Massachusetts town, Beverly Farms, where he remained until his death in 2009. Drawing from in-depth research as well as interviews with the writer&amp;#8217;s colleagues, friends, and family, Begley explores how Updike&amp;#8217;s fiction was shaped by his tumultuous personal life&amp;#8212;including his enduring religious faith, his two marriages, and his first-hand experience of the &amp;#8220;adulterous society&amp;#8221; he was credited with exposing in the bestselling &lt;em&gt;Couples&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a sharp critical sensibility that lends depth and originality to his analysis, Begley probes Updike&amp;#8217;s best-loved works&amp;#8212;from &lt;em&gt;Pigeon Feathers&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Witches of Eastwick&lt;/em&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; tetralogy&amp;#8212;and reveals a surprising and deeply complex character fraught with contradictions: a kind man with a vicious wit, a gregarious charmer who was ruthlessly competitive, a private person compelled to spill his secrets on the printed page. &lt;em&gt;Updike&lt;/em&gt; offers an admiring yet balanced look at this national treasure, a master whose writing continues to resonate like no one else&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;" />
