~As an actress, I lover a story that jumps off a page onto a movie screen in my mind! Scott should be winning Oscars for this! BRAVO!
God Bless You,

Award Winning Lead Actress
~Rating: 5 stars
The extremely realist dialogue and excellent characterizations keep readers involved every step of the way. The action keeps them rapidly following along, unwilling to stop reading. Excellent supporting characterizations maintain interest, with a touch of the mystical adding yet another dimension throughout.
