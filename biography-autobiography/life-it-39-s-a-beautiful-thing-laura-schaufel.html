  <title>Life, It&#39;s a Beautiful Thing - Laura Schaufel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life, its a Beautiful Thing is Laura Schaufels technique of spreading the love of God.  It is her method of expectantly accomplishing a desired aim.  Touching lives spiritually is her intent and purpose, promoting faith, hope, and inspiration.
&lt;p&gt;
Laura Schaufel is a witness to the power of prayer.  She testifies to an extraordinary event manifesting divine intervention in human affairs that happened in 1990, in Folsom, California.  This little book is an account of astonishing and noteworthy happenings of an ordinary woman who lives in the knowledge that God has a purpose, a destiny, and a plan for each of us.  God has been showing her His plan all of her life through acts and actions that only now does she, to some extent, understand.
&lt;p&gt;
As she stood in that cold mechanical hospital room listening to her son fight for just one more breath of air, she prayed to God to let him live.  Please return him to me for whatever time I may have, here on earth, she asked.  But the plans laid out in heaven for that day called for her son to return home to our Father.  Whereas you do not know what will happen tomorrow.  For what is your life?  It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.  (James 4:14 NKJV)
&lt;p&gt;
In the midst of deaths storm is when your faith and the presence of the Lord are most needed to provide the strength to persevere.  Look and listen to these true stories of God working in His way.  Then see how you can reach the point in prayer where you are at ease with the world and can accept all of Gods plans for you as your destiny unfolds. &lt;br&gt;" />
