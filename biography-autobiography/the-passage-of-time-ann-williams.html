  <title>The Passage of Time - Ann Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In her first book, We Are Surely Blessed, Ann Williams focused on her
parents, Leslie and Esther Johnson. They watch as their five older children grow
to adulthood, marry and start their own familys while the two younger children
continue their education. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
They pulled together during the Great Depression, WW I, and saw two of
their sons serve in the army during WW II.&lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
It is now 1949. In The Passage of Time you will see their dream of
having a large family, materialize. Each of the families has settled in the farming
area around Guss, Iowa. Follow them as they prosper with their own dreams
and watch their children go forward. Share with them the beginning of life and
the loss of life, as sudden sadness engulfs them.&lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Join Esther and Leslie as they celebrate their 50th Anniversary. They
continue to share the love of the land, the pride in their family, and the country
in which they were born. They continue to hold their faith in God. There is
a feeling that someone is always watching over them and He will walk with them
for the rest of their lives.&lt;bR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;
Follow their youngest daughter as she and her husband and two sons
leave the Iowa farm lands and settle in San Jose, California." />
