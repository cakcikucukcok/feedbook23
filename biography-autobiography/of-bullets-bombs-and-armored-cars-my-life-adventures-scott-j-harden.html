  <title>Of Bullets, Bombs, and Armored Cars, My Life Adventures - Scott J. Harden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is an easy reading biography of the amazing life of Scott J. Harden and how he survived being shot at as a child because his mother was one of the first female union presidents, and again later in life in a second attempt against him by a mad woman. It tells of his living in the forest in a Girl Scout camp as a child, then later living with people like the president of a European country, then becoming a merchant marine officer sailing in the oceans, dropping bombs from helicopters on secret targets, and helping the communist empire to fall. All these are part of his biography and life. He also built the first US satellites that went into space, and he secretly put his autographs inside so they would be there two thousand years later for someone to see and wonder about when the first US spacecraft will finally fall to Earth." />
