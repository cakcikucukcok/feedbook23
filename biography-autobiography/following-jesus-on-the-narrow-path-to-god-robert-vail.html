  <title>Following Jesus on the Narrow Path to God - Robert Vail</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following Jesus on the Narrow Path to God, is a book that explores the hard choices for following Jesus throughout our lifetime; despite the busy nature of our lives and the many distractions the world often entices us with each day. God is calling every person in the world to come home to Him in heaven, but this pathway can only be found through Jesus at the Cross on Calvary. It is a journey where we must decide who we want to follow in life.  Will we follow Jesus or will we follow the World? One path leads to everlasting life, while the other path leads to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will share with you many lessons the Lord has given me to strengthen me in my own journey from a wheelchair. Inside the book, Following Jesus on the Narrow Path to God, you will be given a chance to explore many areas within each of your lives and you will see how these areas have impacted your faith:&lt;/p&gt;
	The two different roads in life&lt;/br&gt;
	Knowing thy self&lt;/br&gt;
	The need for mercy&lt;/br&gt;
	Knowing God&lt;/br&gt;
	Following Jesus&lt;/br&gt;
	Accepting help from the Holy Spirit&lt;/br&gt;
	Finding your place in the Church&lt;/br&gt;" />
