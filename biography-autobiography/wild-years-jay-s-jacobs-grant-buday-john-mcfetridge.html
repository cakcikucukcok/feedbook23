  <title>Wild Years - Jay S. Jacobs, Grant Buday, John McFetridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Legend. Bum. Genius. Con Man. Devoted husband and father. Myth. Storyteller. Inspiration. Drunk. Visionary. Tom Waits is all of these things.
Waits is the lifeline between the great Beat poets and today&#39;s rock &amp; roll heroes. He&#39;s old enough to be your dad and cool enough to be your hero. One of the few truly original musicians recording today, he&#39;s also the rare singer who can actually act, and he has put together a respectable body of work in movies.
Wild Years: The Music and Myth of Tom Waits retraces the long road that Waits has traveled and explores the music that made him a legend. Jay S. Jacobs looks at the towering myth that Waits has created for himself.
Jay S. Jacobs follows the fate of one of America&#39;s pre-eminent artists, a very private man whose career embodies a quirky array of fulfillment and loss, beauty and strangeness.
This revised and updated edition includes a new chapter, with insight on Waits&#39; career in the 21st century thus far, as well as the most complete discography available in print. Tom&#39;s Wild Years - a poignant, revealing celebration of the man and all his myths." />
