  <title>Life Problems? Study Problems? No Problem! - Patrick Ng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was motivated to write about my life journey problems that I went through being prompted by the calling of our Lord Jesus Christ. Through his mother, Mary, I felt a great urge to let people know of how he had helped me to overcome all my earthly problems. The problems of my life journey started when I became aware of the happenings around me, starting at age five through, to my open-heart bypass in the year 2000 when I was fifty-three years old. Help cametimes when I most neededfrom Jesus, our Saviour. Jesus had also helped me in my studies as well as in my career. I was taught how to conquer fear, sorrow, depression, and mental blocks. Temptations were also strong when one is down, but the faith that you hold strongly will see you through. Physical pain can also be overcome if you have faith. Trust in God is the key word. For all inspiration, motivation, strength, and love come from him above if only you call. My life journey has not yet ended, and my second heart bypass is yet to be seen if God would help me. Amen." />
