  <title>The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes - Richard Ben-Veniste</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Richard Ben-Veniste hates being lied to. He especially hates it when the American people are lied to. Widely respected as a trial lawyer, Ben-Veniste delivers a fascinating insider&#39;s tale in his memoir of a career spent fighting hypocrisy and seeking accountability among the highest ranks of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A legal wunderkind, Ben-Veniste was hired at age thirty by Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox to investigate the Watergate cover-up. As chief of the Watergate Task Force at the time of the infamous &quot;Saturday Night Massacre,&quot; the author played an important role in prosecuting the case and revealed the extent of Richard Nixon&#39;s involvement with his top lieutenants in a conspiracy to obstruct justice and commit perjury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Watergate, Ben-Veniste had investigated and prosecuted corruption in the office of Speaker of the House John W. McCormack. In 1980 the author served as a defense lawyer in the controversial Abscam case, delving into a flawed sting operation that pushed the boundaries of legality and tested due process of law. In the Senate Whitewater hearings, Ben-Veniste helped expose the partisan agenda behind the effort to take down President Clinton. The author gained further national prominence as a member of the 9/11 Commission, in which his artful questioning of Condoleeza Rice revealed how ill-prepared the Bush Administration had been in the weeks leading up to 9/11. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lifelong devotee to the principles of an open democracy, the author argues that the pursuit of truth is not one that should depend on party affiliations--that we should all seek to be partisans for the truth. Ben-Veniste recounts a remarkable career spent at the center of the most poignant public investigations of the last half century, fighting the abuse of power by those who wielded it most.&lt;/p&gt;" />
