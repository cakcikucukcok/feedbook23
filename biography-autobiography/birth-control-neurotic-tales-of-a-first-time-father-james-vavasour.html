  <title>Birth Control: Neurotic Tales of a First Time Father - James Vavasour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="James finds himself woefully unprepared when his firstborn daughter, Abby, arrives into the world. On the drive from the hospital with his wife and baby, he plods along at twenty-five miles an hour while scanning the horizon for road debris, drunken drivers, and collapsing overpasses. Despite bills, diapers, and a baby that never seems to be happy, he maintains his sense of humor-even while reflecting on his own damaged childhood, which left him with a single kidney and questions about what it means to love and be loved. When he&#39;s not tackling big issues, he&#39;s neurotically brooding over his lackluster parenting skills, nonexistent sex life, and the disturbing image of his wife fishing out baby poop from under her fingernails. Appealing to a new generation of caring fathers and the women they love, Birth Control delivers honest, often embarrassing, but always heartfelt insights into what it&#39;s like to surrender to the overpowering love that comes with a first child." />
