  <title>Two Voices, One Story - Amy Masters, Elaine Rizzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two Voices, One Story&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
This is the true story of a girl called Amy and the English “mother” who adopted her from an institute in China when she was just a baby.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
It’s a story about love, family and identity; and the unbreakable bond between mother and daughter.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
When Amy came to be adopted in 1999, China’s then notorious one-child policy had given rise to a generation of missing girls. Amy was one of them, destined to life in an orphanage if she was lucky enough to survive. That is, until she was adopted by a loving British couple who were desperate to give her the home she deserved; Elaine and Lee.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
In this moving autobiography, Amy and Elaine chart their own personal experiences of their shared adoption story. Theirs is not a political account, but one which is open about the challenges of adopting a child from a foreign country and the long journey that follows; from China to the UK and from infancy through to adolescence, as Amy and her new family learn and grow together.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Now a bright and ambitious young woman on the eve of her eighteenth birthday, Amy is braced for an exciting journey into adulthood, one which her proud mother is delighted to be able to share.&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
&amp;#13;
Two Voices, One Story is a frank but uplifting account of the complex adoption process and the profound relationship between a mother and her adopted child." />
