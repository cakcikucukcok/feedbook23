  <title>A Life so Good Revisited - Ronald Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story that leads from growing up in a small country town into adulthood and the darkest depths of hell and insanity and out the other side to a wonderful life, completely free from the past, to an enlightenment few get to experience. It is a journey, which is not really a journey but a gradual awakening, as to how the God of his understanding has been with him throughout.
The following is a review of the first book, A Life So Good: 
An Australian memoir as good as any Tim Winton novel. A raw and very poignant memoir. The authors ability to strip back his life without embellishments keeps the story real. The narrative is driven at a lively pace through his ability to create effortless movement through time. He carries the reader along as if on his shoulders, such is the caring nature of this sensitive man who suffered the pain and indignity of an addiction to alcohol. A life which so far spans some seventy years and is condensed into this 174 page story makes for easy lively reading. How can one man accomplish so much in the face of such adversity? It is more than a story of hope as he demonstrates that if your heart is good there are people in this great country of ours willing to give you a go. Its a not a love story but a story of love and the surprising way you can find yourself through love (Leanne Esposito, October 31, 2015)." />
