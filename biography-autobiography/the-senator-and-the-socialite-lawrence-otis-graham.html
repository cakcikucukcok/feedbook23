  <title>The Senator and the Socialite - Lawrence Otis Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the true story of America&#39;s first black dynasty. The years after the Civil War represented an astonishing moment of opportunity for African-Americans. The rush to build a racially democratic society from the ruins of slavery is never more evident than in the personal history of Blanche Kelso Bruce and his heirs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born a slave in 1841, Bruce became a local Mississippi sheriff, developed a growing Republican power base, amassed a real-estate fortune, and became the first black to serve a full Senate term. He married Josephine Willson, the daughter of a wealthy black Philadelphia doctor. Together they broke racial barriers as a socialite couple in 1880s Washington, D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By befriending President Ulysses S. Grant, abolitionist Frederick Douglass, and a cadre of liberal black and white Republicans, Bruce spent six years in the U.S. Senate, then gained appointments under four presidents (Garfield, Arthur, Harrison, and McKinley), culminating with a top Treasury post, which placed his name on all U.S. currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Reconstruction, the Bruce family entertained lavishly in their two Washington town houses and acquired an 800-acre plantation, homes in four states, and a fortune that allowed their son and grandchildren to attend Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard University, beginning in 1896.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senator&#39;s legacy would continue with his son, Roscoe, who became both a prot&amp;#233;g&amp;#233; of Booker T. Washington and a superintendent of Washington, D.C.&#39;s segregated schools. When the family moved to New York in the 1920s and formed an alliance with John D. Rockefeller Jr., the Bruces became an enviable force in Harlem society. Their public battle to get their grandson admitted into Harvard University&#39;s segregated dormitories elicited the support of people like W. E. B. Du Bois and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and broke brave new ground for blacks of their day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the end, the Bruce dynasty&#39;s wealth and stature would disappear when the Senator&#39;s grandson landed in prison following a sensational trial and his Radcliffe-educated granddaughter married a black Hollywood actor who passed for white.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By drawing on Senate records, historic documents, and the personal letters of Senator Bruce, Josephine, their colleagues, friends, children, and grandchildren, author Lawrence Otis Graham weaves a riveting social history that spans 120 years. From Mississippi to Washington, D.C., to New York, &lt;em&gt;The Senator and the Socialite&lt;/em&gt; provides a fascinating look into the history of race and class in America.&lt;/p&gt;" />
