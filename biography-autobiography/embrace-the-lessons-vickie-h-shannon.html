  <title>Embrace the Lessons - Vickie H. Shannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was not intended to be about me.  It is a memoir, yet, I truly do not consider myself so significant that anyone would want to read my memoirs.  It consists of stories throughout my life that have been significant because of the lessons learned.  If not for the belief that I am here as a student, in this University called Earth, with the ultimate goal of evolving spiritually, then life in and of itself would be an existential purgatory.  I write to teach.  The paradox is that we are alone in this journey called life, yet we are never truly alone.  We are all connected.  Embrace the Lessons speaks to a Universal truth that acknowledges that the purpose of the human experience is to grow as spiritual beings.  I share with you my personal stories of transcendence, in the hopes that you will become open to your own.  	You are invited to open yourself to the lessons that Life has to offer.   Embrace the Lessons is a look inside one womans journey to remain on the path of healing and transcendence.  Much of this book was written over the course of three decades.  It is packed with insight and inspiration.  It is thought provoking, heart-felt, and entertaining.  It is written for you.  It is written to inspire you to engage in frequent acts of courage and stamina in order to awaken to your own personal growth and transformation.  Awaken to your Teachers.  Listen, watch, and observe the many forms in which they appear.  Fear not. Open your mind and heart in order to Embrace the Lessons.&lt;/p&gt;" />
