  <title>Why the Jailbird Prays - Mark Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why The Jailbird prays is an inspirational, humorous, heart touching and evangelistic tool reading, which takes the reader outside looking in behind prison walls and jail cells to get an idea of what jail life is like and understanding an inmates way of living. This book will take you into the minds of the inmate while educating you and giving you an inmate&#39;s point of view, life story and testimony. This reading will empower, educate, encourage, enlighten and enhance ou individually. You will find humor in this book that will amuse you; however, you will be saddened by some of the inmate&#39;s life experiences, childhood growing up and abuse that they encountered. In the beginning of the book, you will read Jailbird Poems Prison Poetry as an appetizer to prepare you for the reading of this book. Each poem is an intro to each story presented in the book, and the poetry reveals my experiences in jail. In addition, the poems exploits the inmates past, bizarre and unorthodox behavior and their individual dysfunctions and issues. Jail Bird Poems Prison Poetry sets the tone for the book. I encourage you to purchase the soundtrack to the book titled Mama I Love You. The combination of the book and the soundtrack is great artistry; however, it bridges the gap between this well written reading and the music composition brings the book alive." />
