  <title>Taking Care of Moses - Barbara O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who left the baby at the Rock of Ages Baptist Church?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Randall Mackey has a secret. He knows who left the baby on the steps of the Rock of Ages Baptist Church. But he can&#39;t tell anyone, not even his best friend, Jaybird. And he certainly can&#39;t let Jaybird&#39;s little sister, Althea, find out because she&#39;d be sure to shout it from the rooftops. Randall can&#39;t tell because Queenie Avery was also there, and he wants to protect her. Poor old Queenie seems to be getting more and more forgetful these days. And now that she&#39;s begun to wander, folks in town want to send her away, which would break Mr. Avery&#39;s heart. While Randall&#39;s busy worrying about doing the right thing, everyone in town is discussing who should take care of baby Moses, and it isn&#39;t long before a feud breaks out. Randall has to come up with a plan that won&#39;t hurt those he most wants to help. And he&#39;s got to do it quickly before the situation gets completely out of control.&lt;/p&gt;" />
