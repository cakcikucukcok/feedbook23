  <title>The Trouble with Skateboarding - Chris Ashley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;
Counterfeit skateboards! Who is trying to put Mike Holt out of business? He&#39;s already had one tragedy in his life, will this be more than he can handle? Jim and Ben need to find out who is doing this quickly or their dreams of a skateboard park will be gone forever.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This is the story of five close friends who all share one common love - skateboarding. They live in the small city of Exton, Pennsylvania that is not known as a skateboarding haven. They have dreams of changing that by helping to open a new skate park in their city. Their plans are taking shape when disasters strikes. Mike&#39;s shop is in danger of being put out of business by a mysterious stranger and that would lead to the end of the 2nd Annual Boardzone Skateboard competition and their skate park dreams.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Like most kids they can&#39;t resist getting involved and jump right in to try and figureout what is going on - and of course, get into a load of trouble in the process. With the help of their Uncle, a retired policeman, the group of young people get into one precarious situation after another while searching for the identity of the counterfeiter. Each day leads our young group one step closer to facing their biggest challenge ever.
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Will they solve the mysterious counterfeit skateboarding ring? Will Mike lose his store and cancel the big competition? Will corrupt city officials steal the land for the new skate park?
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
No one is going to take away their dream of the first skate park in their hometown. Even if they have to face their enemy head on - they will.
&lt;/P&gt;
