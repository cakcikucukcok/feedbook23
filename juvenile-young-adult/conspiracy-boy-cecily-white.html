  <title>Conspiracy Boy - Cecily White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nobody said senior year was going to be easy, but I wasn&#39;t expecting pure hell, either. That&#39;s right. HELL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demons attacking. Cheerleaders screaming. Vampires and werewolves asking where the bathroom is. Just another day here at St. Michael&#39;s Guardian Training Academy. It wouldn&#39;t be so bad if the administration would let me get back to my demon-slaying duties like every other angelblood on campus. But with my bondmate Jack promoted to head trainer, my annoying fiancé Luc trying to start a political uprising, and that pesky prophecy still floating around predicting I&#39;m going to kill everyone I love...well, let&#39;s just say &quot;complicated&quot; took on a whole new meaning.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But things are looking up.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I can survive Luc&#39;s deadly Sovereign Trials and keep my evil twin sister from starting a war, Jack and I might actually have a chance of saving the world. If not, at least I won&#39;t have to worry about what to wear to prom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All&#39;s fair in love and war. Let the games begin.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Angel Academy series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book 1: Prophecy Girl&lt;br&gt;Book 2: Conspiracy Boy&lt;/p&gt;" />
