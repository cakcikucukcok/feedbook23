  <title>The Boy with Beans in His Ears - Alyse Shetler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Magic Garden, located in Imnaha, Oregon, began as a mission project headed by Robin Martin. It was the dream of the members of the Joseph United Methodist Church to teach children and members of the community how to plant, grow, and harvest their food, all while encouraging joy in gardening. Over two tons of food have been grown and harvested over the past seven years the Magic Garden has been in operation. Most of the food is given away to kids, schools, and community organizations. And some of the produce is preserved and sold at the local farmers market in the summer and fall months to benefit the Magic Garden Project. The Magic Garden would not be possible without the devoted members of the Joseph United Methodist Church, Janie Tippett for donating the land used, the many community members who volunteer their time and materials, and of course, Robin Martin, whose dream has become a reality with countless hours of hard work, dedication, and of course, love." />
