  <title>Sworn to Ascension - Terah Edun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ciardis Weathervane is officially engaged to one man and bonded to a second. She should be planning the wedding ceremony, bearding the nobles of the imperial court in their dens, and exposing an imposter emperor.  Instead she&#39;s spending her engagement on the lawless road to the western lands.  Now with the help of a guide from a tribe of seers, Ciardis is traveling to the ancient city of Kifar. Rumored to hold the only device capable of stopping the blutgott, Ciardis, Sebastian and Thanar must break a half-century&#39;s old quarantine in order to enter the fabled city.  But the collar of Diamis is not the only thing they seek. The princess heir&#39;s pet wyvern lurks in wait for them and the emperor, who has done everything short of challenging the new triad of Algardis outright, wants its head on a platter upon their return.  If the unscrupulous bandits don&#39;t make short work of them, Ciardis knows that when they return she and Sebastian will have to a face and unmask the man who has stolen the imperial throne. The only question that remains...will that be before or after they&#39;re forced to battle a god?" />
