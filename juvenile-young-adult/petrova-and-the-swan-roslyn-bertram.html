  <title>Petrova and the Swan - Roslyn Bertram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ideal book for children who long to dance. Based on a true story. A young child called Petrova lives in the countryside with her mother and father, brother, Henry, and baby sister, Isabelle. One rainy day when Petrova begins to make something from scraps of wool, the creation of her trusty new companion, Muddle, is born. But Muddle isn&#39;t the only thing to have entered Petrova&#39;s world that day. It is sitting with him that evening when Petrova becomes transfixed by the form of a swan, and from that moment, we are taken through a continuous series of events that open up the destined pathway of Petrova&#39;s new dream." />
