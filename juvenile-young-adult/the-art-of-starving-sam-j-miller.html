  <title>The Art of Starving - Sam J. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the 2017 Andre Norton Award for Outstanding Young Adult Science Fiction or Fantasy Book&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Funny, haunting, beautiful, relentless, and powerful, &lt;em&gt;The Art of Starving&lt;/em&gt; is a classic in the making.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;Book Riot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt hasn&amp;#8217;t eaten in days. His stomach stabs and twists inside, pleading for a meal, but Matt won&amp;#8217;t give in. The hunger clears his mind, keeps him sharp&amp;#8212;and he needs to be as sharp as possible if he&amp;#8217;s going to find out just how Tariq and his band of high school bullies drove his sister, Maya, away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt&amp;#8217;s hardworking mom keeps the kitchen crammed with food, but Matt can resist the siren call of casseroles and cookies because he has discovered something: the less he eats the more he seems to have . . . &lt;em&gt;powers&lt;/em&gt;. The ability to see things he shouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to see. The knack of tuning in to thoughts right out of people&amp;#8217;s heads. Maybe even the authority to bend time and space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what is lunch, really, compared to the secrets of the universe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt decides to infiltrate Tariq&amp;#8217;s life, then use his powers to uncover what happened to Maya. All he needs to do is keep the hunger and longing at bay. No problem. But Matt doesn&amp;#8217;t realize there are many kinds of hunger&amp;#8230;and he isn&amp;#8217;t in control of all of them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A darkly funny, moving story of body image, addiction, friendship, and love, Sam J. Miller&amp;#8217;s debut novel will resonate with any reader who&amp;#8217;s ever craved the power that comes with self-acceptance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
