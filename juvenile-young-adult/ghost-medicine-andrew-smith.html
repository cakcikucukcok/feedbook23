  <title>Ghost Medicine - Andrew Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The summer before Troy Stotts turns seventeen, his mother dies. Troy and his father barely speak, communicating instead by writing notes on a legal pad by the phone. Troy spends most of his time with his closest friends: Tom Buller, brash and fearless, the son of a drunk; Gabe Benavidez, smart enough to know he&#39;ll never take over the family ranch; and Gabe&#39;s sister, Luz, whose family overprotects her, and who Troy has loved since they were children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;           Troy and his friends don&#39;t want trouble. They want this to be the summer of what Troy calls &quot;ghost medicine,&quot; when time seems to stop, so they won&#39;t have to face the past or the future. But before the summer is over, their paths will cross in dangerous and fateful ways with people who will change their lives: Rose, a damaged derelict who lives with a flock of wild horses and goats; and Chase Rutledge, the arrogant sheriff&#39;s son. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;           Troy and his friends want to disappear. Instead, they will become what they least expect --brothers, lovers, heroes, &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
