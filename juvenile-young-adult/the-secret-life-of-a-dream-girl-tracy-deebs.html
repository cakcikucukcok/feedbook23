What was &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; part of the plan was falling for a guy she can never tell the truth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keegan Matthews has been secretly crushing on Dahlia ever since she started at his school. Sure, Dahlia thinks he&#39;s crushing on some other girl--not realizing his Dream Girl is actually &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;--but he figures, play along with her tips to woo someone else, let her get to know him, and then make his move.
