  <title>Kitty and the Tiger Treasure - Paula Harrison, Jenny Lovlie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Girl by day. Cat by night. Ready for an adventure.&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This chapter book is an excellent choice to share during homeschooling, in particular for children ages 6 to 8 who are ready to read independently. It&amp;#8217;s a fun way to keep your child engaged and as a supplement for activity books for children.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet Kitty, a charming chapter book character with catlike superpowers. In book two in this chapter book series, Kitty must recover the priceless Golden Tiger treasure after it&amp;#8217;s been stolen. With dramatic two-color art on every page and an emphasis on friendship, family, and building self-confidence, the Kitty books are the perfect choice for newly independent readers and fans of Rebecca Elliott&amp;#8217;s Owl Diaries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a new exhibition arrives at the local museum, Kitty is excited to see its most prized artifact, the Golden Tiger. Sadly, her cat, Pumpkin, won&amp;#8217;t be able to see the Golden Tiger because pets aren&amp;#8217;t allowed to visit the galleries.&amp;#160;That night, Kitty decides to use her catlike superpowers to sneak Pumpkin&amp;#160;into the museum. When they arrive, it&amp;#8217;s just in time to see someone stealing the Golden Tiger statue! The museum&#39;s security cat, Cleo, is devastated that she let the bandit get away. But never fear! Kitty and Pumpkin are there to help Cleo track down the&amp;#160;culprit and recover the statue before morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kitty and the Tiger Treasure&lt;/em&gt; is the second book in a chapter book series about Kitty and her superhero adventures. With an aspirational main character, a kindle of cats, striking two-color art on every page, and fun facts included at the end of each story, these chapter books are just right for newly independent readers&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
