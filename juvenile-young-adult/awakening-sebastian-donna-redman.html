      <meta name="description" content="This is what I need you to know. Sometimes life goes bad, really bad.  That&#39;s what happened to me. I tried, but I couldn&#39;t face it, so I made my decision.  &quot;I can barely breathe. It&#39;s almost time. Is this really what I want?&quot;  Who could&#39;ve known what would happen next?  This is a novel like no other.  Embark on an extraordinary journey inside the mind of Sebastian Smith, your average guy, plunging into that tumultuous mosh pit: his final year of high school. It&#39;s a year tangled up with the band, his studies, his mates, the spoken for girl and the unspeakable grief in his home. It&#39;s the year that Seb learns the distressing consequences of bad choices and the unshakable courage needed to rebuild a devastated life.  A novel of tragedy, redemption and hope." />
