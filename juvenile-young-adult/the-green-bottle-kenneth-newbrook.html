  <title>The Green Bottle - Kenneth Newbrook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ken and his dog Spot are inseparable, of course, the fact that Spot can talk is a great advantage. Particularly when the duo are once more involved in an adventure...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From saving orphans from Workhouses to helping an ancient Egyptian prince recover his treasure, through Roman camps at Hadrians wall and an English village during the Napoleonic Wars, Ken and Spot are always just in the right place at the right time. Or the wrong place, if you look at it from the point of view of the villains that they help to apprehend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each story leaves the reader wondering what an earth can happen next. He could not even begin to guess!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story takes Ken and Spot on an incredible adventure. They are captured by a gang of pirates and taken on board their ship, where Ken and Spot are forced to take part in the capture of a Spanish Galleon and steal their cargo of gold.&lt;/p&gt;
Ken and Spot were only trying to get back to England and lead a normal life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;........... will they make it?&lt;/p&gt;" />
