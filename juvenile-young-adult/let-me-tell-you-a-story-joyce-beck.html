  <title>Let Me Tell You a Story - Joyce Beck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is dedicated with love to my grandchildren: Kathryn, Jacob, Harrison, Nolan, Ryan, Andrew, Lauren, Luke, and Kaitlyn. 
Each of us is unique and very special in many ways. All of us have had different experiences in our childhood. Perhaps by sharing them with our families after they are grown, they will be giving them a true sense of family. I encourage you to share your stories with loved ones and give them the courage to share their feelings and challenges with you. 
That is the purpose of this book for me. I wrote this book in the hope that, by sharing with my grandchildren and future great-grandchildren, I will give them a window into the past and the desire to share with their families things that they remember from their own childhood." />
