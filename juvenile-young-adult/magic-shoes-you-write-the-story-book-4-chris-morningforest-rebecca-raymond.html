  <title>Magic Shoes - You Write the Story Book 4 - Chris Morningforest, Rebecca Raymond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Magic Shoes is Book 4 in a series created so that young authors can practice using a set of related illustrations to write their own story. Filled with colorful pictures, the book encourages young writers to make up a tale of fun and adventure. Walking down the path one day, a little Happy kid finds a pair of shoes and starts off on a great adventure. During the night, the shoes mysteriously disappear - oh dear! Originally created for a literacy project, these books are now available to the general public through this website and others.  Questions, after the story ends, help the writer focus on elements of creating a story, encouraging further exploration.  Come join other children around the world as they use our books to reinforce Language Arts skills.  We create phonics books, alphabet focused books, and general story books, too.  All books emphasize caring and sharing, and positive aspects of living.  Find our books on many internet sites. We are-Creating A Happy World of Stories for Kids Everywhere." />
