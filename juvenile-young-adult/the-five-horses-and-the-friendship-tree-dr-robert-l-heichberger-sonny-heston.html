  <title>The Five Horses and  the Friendship Tree - Dr. Robert L. Heichberger, Sonny Heston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every horse, just like people, has a personality of their very own. Some horses are affectionate   when around people and others may be shy until they get to know you.  And, on occasion, there may be one in the herd who is just plain bossy around the other horses and  likes to be in charge. The horse Marsha in this story has just that kind of personality.  Some may say that Marsha is a horse who has a bit of surplus ego status when around others horses. But with the help of four other horses in the herd and a beautiful shade tree in the pasture, Marsha learns to be a gracious and grateful member of the herd of five.
This story will thoroughly capture the attention of  the reader. The story takes place on Mr. Ranch&#39;s horse farm. The horses love to have their fun time in the nearby pasture. The pasture is a natural setting of tasty grass, a stream of cool water, and beautiful shade trees. There is one large tree in particular which   seems to be  the horses&#39; favorite.  And the pasture too  is the home of   an abundance of  wild life such as deer, wild turkeys, Canada geese,  and colorful birds. The story begins on a beautiful sunny day. But in the afternoon the sun begins to dim.   Large gray clouds fill the sky as thunder is heard in the distance, and soon the rains move in with a vengeance. Four of the horses immediately return to their stable for shelter, but NOT Marsha, she says that she is brave and not afraid of &quot;a silly thunderstorm&quot;. But Marsha soon finds out otherwise. 
This story will thoroughly captivate the attention of those who read it.  And the reader&#39;s heart strings of thoughtful emotion will be   moved by the dramatic events of this day.  What a lasting impact will be yours at whatever age you happen to be!" />
