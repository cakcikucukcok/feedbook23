  <title>The Possibilities of Sainthood - Donna Freitas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Antonia Lucia Labella has two secrets: at fifteen, she&#39;s still waiting for her first kiss, and she wants to be a saint. An official one. Seem strange? Well, to Antonia, saints are royalty, and she wants her chance at being a princess. All her life she&#39;s kept company with these kings and queens of small favors, knowing exactly whom to pray to on every occasion. Unfortunately, the two events Antonia&#39;s prayed for seem equally unlikely to happen. It&#39;s not for lack of trying. For how long has she been hoping to gain the attention of the love of her life - the tall, dark, and &lt;i&gt;so &lt;/i&gt;good-looking Andy Rotellini? Too long to mention. And every month for the last eight years, Antonia has sent a petition to the Vatican proposing a new patron saint and bravely offering herself for the post. So what if she&#39;s not dead? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Antonia learns, in matters of the heart and sainthood, things are about as straightforward as wound-up linguini, and sometimes you need to recognize the signs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
