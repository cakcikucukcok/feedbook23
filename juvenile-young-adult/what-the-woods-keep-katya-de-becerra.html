  <title>What the Woods Keep - Katya de Becerra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What the Woods Keep&lt;/i&gt; is the stunning debut of Katya de Becerra, who combines mystery, science fiction, and dark fantasy in a twisty story that will keep you mesmerized right up to the final page. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her eighteenth birthday, Hayden inherits her childhood home--on the condition that she uncover its dark secrets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayden tried to put the past behind her, and it worked. She&#39;s getting ready for college, living in a Brooklyn apartment, and hanging out with her best friend and roommate Del. But now it&#39;s all catching up with her: her mother&#39;s mysterious disappearance a decade before, her father&#39;s outlandish theories about a lost supernatural race, and Hayden&#39;s own dark dreams of strange symbols and rituals in the Colorado woods where she grew up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as Hayden arrives at her hometown, her friend Del in tow, it begins: Neighbors whisper secrets about Hayden&#39;s mother; the boy next door is now all grown-up in a very distracting way; and Hayden feels the trees calling to her. And among them, deep in the woods, Hayden will discover something incredible--something that threatens reality itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An Imprint Book&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&quot;Blending mythology and a contemporary story of family drama, de Becerra&#39;s debut novel is a narrative that will keep readers enthralled.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Spooky atmospherics and moral ambiguity complement the blend of science and myth to create a thoughtful and compelling horror fantasy.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;BCCB&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This book glues you to the edge of your seat. The writing is powerful, with dashes of humor to lighten the tension at just the right moments... One of the best sci-fi/horror/mysteries I&#39;ve ever read.&quot; --Derek Milman, author of &lt;i&gt;Scream All Night&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The characters in this debut novel are interesting and modern, particularly Hayden&#39;s humorous, vibrant roommate... Adds a new angle to the &quot;small town with a secret&quot; genre.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;VOYA&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A magical, intelligent twist on the Nibelungenlied epic, with elements of science, set in a real world that is frightening and wonderful. Highly recommended.&quot; --Rena Rossner, author of &lt;i&gt;The Sisters of the Winter Wood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;What an amazing, creepy, spooktacular book! What the Woods Keep is a unique blend of fantasy, sci-fi, and horror story all rolled into one. It gave me shivers down my spine and kept me awake at night, both because of the chill factor and just because I couldn&#39;t wait to see what happened next. This book is everything you could want, from a spooky cabin in the woods to a massive conspiracy to a fantasy romance. Definitely check it out. It&#39;s so much fun in so many ways that you won&#39;t want to stop reading.&quot; --Caryn Lix, author of &lt;i&gt;Sanctuary&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This book was so. damn. good. Lush and creepy, with a totally unique yet totally relatable heroine. I LOVED the way this book pinned logic and science against fantasy and primal fear--and managed to find the common ground between them in a deeply incisive way. A fast, frantic, fascinating read. Very highly recommended for anyone interested in mythology, psychology, or just some good scares.&quot; --Maxine Kaplan, author of &lt;i&gt;The Accidental Bad Girl&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A stellar debut from a stellar author... De Becerra has a striking gift for description and using the setting to create atmosphere. The novel is haunting and the place is a character of its own... I loved every minute! I felt like the Colorado woods of Hayden&#39;s childhood were calling to me, as they were to her!&quot; --Lucia DiStefano, author of &lt;i&gt;Borrowed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;An amazing, immersive contemporary fantasy with strong female characters, female friendships, and descriptions that will make you feel like you&#39;re walking alongside them.&quot;  --S. Gonzales, author of &lt;i&gt;The Law of Inertia&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Part fairy tale, part science fiction, part horror, this novel takes the best parts of these genres and blends them into something completely unique, satisfying, and new... Super smart and spooky, this story kept me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. A must read.&quot; --Tara Gilboy, author of &lt;i&gt;Unwritten&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you like howling winds, ominous birds, dark woods, clouds casting shadows over a perfectly creepy town, blood (okay, you don&#39;t have to like blood), cryptic messages, mystery, and intensely likeable heroines in the midst of it all... you will LOVE this book as much as I did. It was the perfect blend of sci-fi, mystery, and fantasy. But this is not your average fantasy. It&#39;s the kind of fantasy that makes you double-bolt the door before you go to bed and maybe even leave on a light or two to ward off the scary dreams. It&#39;s the kind of YA that reminded me of why I love YA in the first place.&quot; --Dana L. Davis, author of &lt;i&gt;Tiffany Sly Lives Here Now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A real high-tension page-turner with a dash of humor to give relief from holding your breath...&quot; -Taryn Bashford, author of &lt;i&gt;The Harper Effect&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you like eerie towns like in &lt;i&gt;Silent Hill&lt;/i&gt; and scary science like in &lt;i&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/i&gt;, then this is your jam.&quot; --Maura Milan, author of &lt;i&gt;Ignite the Stars&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The book pretty much had everything--friendship, mystery, creepiness, and a dash of romance. Trust me, you&#39;ll want to get lost in these woods!&quot; --Candace Robinson, author of &lt;i&gt;Quinsey Wolfe&#39;s Glass Vault&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; The Bride of Glass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
