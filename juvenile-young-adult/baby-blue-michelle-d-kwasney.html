  <title>Baby Blue - Michelle D. Kwasney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We sat at the kitchen table, across from each other. In the same spots we sat for dinner up till a month ago. The shadows on the table looked like prison bars again. This time it was Star being caged. Star, who thought leaving made her free. That life would be all hunky-dory shampooing heads and sweeping floors while Mama got slapped around-far enough away so she wouldn&#39;t have to hear the screams.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;  That&#39;s when I knew for sure-I couldn&#39;t leave Mama. And Star couldn&#39;t make me any more than I could make her stay.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A painfully beautiful novel that exposes the haunting world of spousal abuse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blue&#39;s family is coming apart at the seams. After Pa drowned in the river, Mama up and married Jinx, whom Blue and Star know is big trouble. And now Star has run away, leaving Blue behind. It was hard enough to watch Mama get knocked around when Jinx was in one of his &quot;moods,&quot; but now, with Star gone, Jinx has spun out of control. It&#39;s up to Blue to find Star and get help for Mama, to piece the family back together again. But Blue is running out of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With biting realism and poignancy, this compelling young-adult novel explores Blue&#39;s struggle to protect her family and stand up against what she knows is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;" />
