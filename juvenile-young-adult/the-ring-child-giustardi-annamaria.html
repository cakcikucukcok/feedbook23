  <title>The Ring Child - Giustardi Annamaria</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This short fable helps us telling, in a simple and understandable way, even to the most little, our lives and our children&amp;rsquo;s, affected by this ugly disease: the Ring 14 Syndrome. We can make understand how difficult it is for them to do things which are pretty easy for the others, and how sweet it is to feel accepted and not excluded, as it often happens, even if they are good hearted and are fantastic children. Disability, when severe as for our children, frightens and pushes away, especially when you don&amp;rsquo;t know the cause. We hope that The ring child may reach the homes of many families with children affected, to bring a little consolation to their isolation; and it may also reach healthy families, to open every heart to disability, removing from the illness the aura of fear, which always accompanies. And we trust that the world of fables, where everything is possible, enters the lives of all the children who are in difficulty like Matteo.&amp;nbsp;Stefania Azzali, Matteo&amp;rsquo;s mother&lt;br /&gt;
and president of Ring14 Association." />
