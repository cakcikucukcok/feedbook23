  <title>The Sloth Who Slowed Us Down - Margaret Wild, Vivienne To</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;When the speediest family in the world finds a sweet, slow sloth on their doorstep, they take him in. But, little do they know, their new pet has quite a bit to teach them. For Amy&#39;s family, there simply aren&#39;t enough hours in the day to get everything done. Mom rushes through her work. Dad rushes through his chores. Even little Amy rushes through dinner. But Sloth does things slowly. He likes to take long, leisurely baths with lots and lots of bubbles. He plays drawn-out, imaginative games. He eats his food slowly, enjoying one small bite at a time. After a few weeks of caring for their new pet, Amy&#39;s family finds that they actually do have enough time to tell one another stories or go for long walks together after dinner--so long as they stop rushing around so much. &lt;I&gt;The Sloth Who Slowed Us Down&lt;/I&gt; is a celebration of slowing down and remembering the important things in life.&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
