  <title>Sleepy Bedtime Tales: A Revolutionary Way to Get Your Child to Sleep At Night - Dan Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book offers a revolutionary way to tell bedtime stories helping to make bedtime a time of peace, calm and sleep for your child. Based on psychological principles and techniques, these stories will help to guide your child comfortably asleep. They are to be read to your child at bedtime, rather than with or by your child. These bedtime stories are written to be read to 4-7 year old&#39;s (they can be read to children as young as two) as they rest in bed with their eyes shut listening along.  Each of the stories takes about 10-15 minutes to read. The sleepy bedtime story approach has been taught to many parents and used by professionals working in care homes to help children fall asleep at night. This approach can be used with any story, but this is the first time that stories have been written specifically to optimise the effectiveness of the techniques. If you are after a scientific, calming, relaxing approach to getting your child to sleep, then this is definitely the bedtime stories book for you." />
