  <title>Howie Snuffelbean and the Fire Hydrant - Edward Scott Anthony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Howies Dad laments giving his son everything he wanted, and he regrets not teaching him the responsibility of earning money for himself. He hopes the summer job at the Water Company is just the thing Howie will need to make him realize what hard work is all about and how necessary it is to learn responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howie is challenged by Joe, a fiery, impish, and likable young boy. Joe becomes Howies arch enemy and nemesis when he knocks Howie off his intellectual high horse. He is also challenged by the two other boys who play a role in Howies development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the summer months, events, people, and circumstances mold and shape Howie into something he didnt think he was capable of becoming: a confident and independent young man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howies perception of life is flipped up-side down by his foremen Myron and his crew. Through hard work and tough love, the four boys are transformed into four young men, ready to take their place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
