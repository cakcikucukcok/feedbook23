  <title>In the End - Demitria Lunetta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The thrilling conclusion to the survival story &lt;em&gt;In the After&lt;/em&gt;, set in a near future where Earth has been overrun by vicious, predatory creatures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been three months since Amy escaped New Hope, and she&#39;s been surviving on her own, like she did in the After. Then one day, her former fellow Guardian&#39;s voice rings out in her earpiece. And in a desperate tone, Kay utters the four words Amy had hoped she would never hear: &lt;em&gt;Dr. Reynolds has Baby&lt;/em&gt;. Now it&#39;s a race against time. In order to save Baby, Amy must make her way to Fort Black, a prison turned survivor colony, where she will need to find Ken, Kay&#39;s brother. He alone holds the key to Baby&#39;s survival. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one small slipup could set off a downward spiral that would not only cost Baby and Amy their lives, but threaten the very survival of the people in the After.&lt;/p&gt;" />
