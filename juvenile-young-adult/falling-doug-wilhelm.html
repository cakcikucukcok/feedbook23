  <title>Falling - Doug Wilhelm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone expected fifteen-year-old Matt Shaw to be Jeffords Junior High&#39;s star basketball player. But Matt never went out for the team. He won&#39;t even touch a ball anymore, and he hardly talks to anyone. No one understands why he&#39;s changed, but Matt knows that it&#39;s his &quot;golden child&quot; older brother who&#39;s really been doing all the changing. Matt can&#39;t imagine what would happen to his family if word got out about Neal&#39;s drug habit and the strung-out strangers he&#39;s seen coming and going from the house when their parents aren&#39;t home. Matt can&#39;t tell anyone what he knows - not his parents, not the police detective who refuses to leave him alone, not even Katie, the one girl he&#39;s ever really had feelings for. But even Matt has to wonder eventually if he&#39;s holding on to someone he may already have lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his unparalleled ear for teen dialogue and emotions, Doug Wilhelm&#39;s new novel is a captivating look at falling apart, falling in love, and all the falling in between.&lt;/p&gt;" />
