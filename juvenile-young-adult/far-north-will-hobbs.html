  <title>Far North - Will Hobbs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the window of the small floatplane, fifteen-year-old Gabe Rogers is getting his first look at Canada&#39;s magnificent Northwest Territories with Raymond Providence, his roommate from boarding school. Below is the spectacular Nahanni River -- wall-to-wall whitewater racing between sheer cliffs and plunging over Virginia Falls. The pilot sets the plane down on the lake-like surface of the upper river for a closer look at the thundering falls. Suddenly the engine quits. The only sound is a dull roar downstream, as the Cessna drifts helplessly toward the falls . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the brutal subarctic winter fast approaching, Gabe and Raymond soon find themselves stranded in Deadmen Valley. Trapped in a frozen world of moose, wolves, and bears, two boys from vastly different cultures come to depend on each other for their very survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
