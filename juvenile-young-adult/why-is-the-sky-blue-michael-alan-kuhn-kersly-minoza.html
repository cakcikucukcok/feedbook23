  <title>Why Is the Sky Blue? - Michael Alan Kuhn, Kersly Minoza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One beautiful, sunny day, two friendsMikey and Natalieadmire the sky. Together, they wonder how the sky gets its lovely blue color. They decide to include their friend Tami, and the three of them head home to ask their parents. 
After seeking the answer from their parents, the friends are all confused. One parent says the sky is blue because it is the color of Gods eye. Another says the sky is blue just like the color of the water in the lake. Who is correct? They decide to find that one answer by climbing to the top of the tallest oak tree. As they climb, they each go in separate directions to follow the various branches of the tree.
When they return to the bottom of the tree, they are frustrated because they each had very different experiences, and there seems to be no one definitive reason why the sky is blue. An unexpected encounter with an old, wise man gives them the surprising twist to the answer they seek." />
