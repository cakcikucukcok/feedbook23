  <title>THE FORTY PRINCES AND THE SEVEN-HEADED DRAGON - A Turkish Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 446&lt;br /&gt;
In this 446th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Turkish Fairy Tale &amp;ldquo;The Forty Princes and the Seven-Headed Dragon.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Padishah (an Eastern King) had forty sons. When it was time to marry, they stipulated that all their wives must have the same father. The Padishah thought about this and eventually said he knew of such a king. But that in order to get his agreement, they would have to face a few challenges. However, he told them how to handle each one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you may ask? Where does the seven-headed dragon fit into the story? And what of his warning about staying at the h&amp;acirc;n (inn). How did everything turn out in the end? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read this story to find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
