  <title>A Dance with Darkness - Courtney Allison Moulton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With scorching romance and fantastic action, this original novella is a prequel to Courtney Allison Moulton&#39;s gripping and epic Angelfire series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There were shadows in this alley that no light touched, and where there was no light, anything could hide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the fourteenth century, angelic reapers struggle to defend London against a legion of the demonic who have their sights set on claiming human souls and ancient relics for a dark purpose. Madeleine, a young but powerful warrior, is duty-bound to fight the demonic, and she lives for this pursuit above all else. Then, on a routine night of tracking, she is ambushed by a cadre of reapers and, though she defeats them all, she is left wounded and at the mercy of their lord, the notorious Bastian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madeleine is astonished when Bastian lets her live. She goes deeper into the world of the demonic and is shocked to meet him again&amp;#8212;this powerful reaper whose touch makes her restless and gives her a thrill unlike anything else. When they fall into a dangerous clandestine affair, her head and her heart must wage their war: can their love overcome his demonic nature? Will her dance with darkness burn her or bring Bastian into the light?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.&lt;/p&gt;" />
