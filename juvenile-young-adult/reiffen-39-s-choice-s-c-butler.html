  <title>Reiffen&#39;s Choice - S. C. Butler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reiffen, only twelve years old, is the true heir to the thrones of both Wayland and Banking. He and his friends Avender and Ferris live in a magical world of talking animals, dwarves, and shape-shifting bears but...he lives with the shame of knowing that no one will ever let him rule these kingdoms, that their crowns will bring him nothing but betrayal and sorrow...and that he is powerless. Reiffen will have only a short life of child&#39;s innocence, a brief respite from the trial of impossible adult responsibility, the trial of attempting to finish a task he can never complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then he is shown the nations of his world from the peak of a fortress drear and tempted with fame and fortune and his rightful place on the throne of great kingdoms--&lt;i&gt;his &lt;/i&gt;kingdoms. He need only surrender his humanity; kill his loves and he would have his childhood fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would be granted great Black knowledge, more furious than anything he had ever imagined. He could desire justice...but would have to kill everything he loved to get it. His prayers would be answered...if only he would sacrifice everything he held dear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Reiffen&#39;s Choice&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in a trilogy about innocence and struggle that can only be compared to &lt;i&gt;Eragon&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Eldest&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Once and Future King&lt;/i&gt; and Raymond E. Feist&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Magician&lt;/i&gt;. It will be an experience you will never forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
