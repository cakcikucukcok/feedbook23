  <title>THE STORY OF THE MAGIC HORSE - A tale from the Arabian Nights - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 226&lt;br /&gt;
In this 225th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Arabian Nights story of &amp;ldquo;The Story Of The Magic Horse&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away in a town in Persia there lived in ancient times a King, or a Padishah, who had three daughters and an only son of such beauty that they drew the eyes of all beholders like moonrise in a clear heaven.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now it was the custom in that country for a great festival to be held at the new year, during which people of all grades, from the highest to the lowest, presented themselves before the King with offerings and salutations. Two gifts were presented and were deemed acceptable. But the gift of the third sage, who was an Indian, appeared more prodigious than all, for he had brought with him a horse of ivory and ebony, for which he claimed that, at the will of its owner, or of any one instructed in the secret, it would rise above the earth and fly, arriving at distant places in a marvellously short space of time. The King, full of wonder at such a statement, and eager to test it, was in some doubt as to how he might do so, for the Indian was unwilling to part with the secret until secure of the reward which in his own mind he had fixed on. Now it happened that at a distance of some three leagues from the city there stood a mountain the top of which was clearly discernible to all eyes; so, in order that the Indian&amp;#39;s word might be proved, the King, pointing to it, said, &amp;quot;Go yonder, and bring back to me while I wait the branch of a palm-tree which grows at the foot of that mountain; then I shall know that what you tell me is true.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Instantly the Indian set foot in the stirrup and vaulted upon his charger, and scarcely had he turned a small peg which was set in the pommel of the saddle, when the horse rose lightly into the air and bore him away at wondrous speed amid the shouts of the beholders; and while all were still gazing, amazed at so sudden a vanishing, he reappeared high overhead, bearing the palm branch, and descending into their midst alighted upon the very spot from which he had started, where, prostrating himself, he laid the branch at the King&amp;#39;s feet.&lt;br /&gt;
The King was so delighted when the wonderful properties of the horse had been thus revealed to him, that, eager to possess it, he bade the Indian name his own reward, declaring that no price could be too great. Then said the sage, &amp;quot;Since your Majesty so truly appreciates the value of my invention, I do not fear that the reward I ask for will seem too high. Give me in marriage the hand of the fairest of your three daughters, and the horse shall be yours.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At so arrogant a claim all the courtiers burst into loud laughter; but the King alone was consumed with the desire of possessing the wonderful treasure. He hesitated as to what he thought he should give. Then the King&amp;#39;s son, Prince Firouz Schah, seeing his father lend ear to so shameful a proposal, became moved with indignation. He approached the Shah and made a proposal&amp;hellip;.. But just what was the proposal he made?&lt;br /&gt;
