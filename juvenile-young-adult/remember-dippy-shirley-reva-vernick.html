  <title>Remember Dippy - Shirley Reva Vernick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;Johnny&#39;s plans fly out the window when he finds out his single mother is leaving town for the summer. She has a breakthough job in upstate New York. He can live with his Aunt Collette but only on the condition that he &quot;help out with&quot; his autistic older cousin, Remember. Yup, you heard it right: Remember Dippy. That&#39;s his cousin&#39;s name&amp;#151;and Remember is a gawky awkward kid with some pretty strange habits, like repeating back almost everything Johnny says and spending hours glued to the weather channel. Johnny&#39;s premonitions of disaster appear at first to come to cringeworthy fruition, but when the two boys save a bully from drowning, salvage the pizzeria guy&#39;s romance, and share girl troubles, Johnny ends up having the summer of his life.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Winner of the Dolly Gray Children&#39;s Literature Award &amp; 2014 Skipping Stones Honor Award&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Shirley Reva Vernick&lt;/B&gt;&#39;s debut novel &lt;I&gt;The Blood Lie&lt;/I&gt; was named on the 2012 Best Fiction for Young Adults list from the American Library Association. It also received the Simon Wiesenthal Once Upon a World Children&#39;s Award and Sydney Taylor Honor Book Award. Shirley lives with her husband, two daughters, and two frisky dogs in western Massachusetts.
