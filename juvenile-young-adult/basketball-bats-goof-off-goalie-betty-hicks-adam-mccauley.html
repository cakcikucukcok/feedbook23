But without team T-shirts or an official name, can they take on the Tigers, a team that plays at the huge YWCA and has a player old enough to shave? Henry feels sure he can lead his friends to victory, but is he really a team player? Or is he a ball hog?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Goof-Off Goalie&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s nothing Goose wants more than to play goalie for his soccer team. It looks like so much fun--and so easy!--on TV. But can he quit daydreaming long enough to stop the ball? With Henry&#39;s training, Goose is sure he can go from goof-off to goalie in no time. Just as Goose starts to improve, Henry gets grounded because his grades are slipping. Will Goose help Henry in return? Or is being a goalie more important than friendship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Basketball Bats&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Goof-Off Goalie&lt;/i&gt; are both 2009 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Books of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
