  <title>My Pet Human - Yasmine Surovec</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From queen cat lady Yasmine Surovec comes a cuddly new chapter book series about a cat in need of a pet human.  Oliver  is an independent kitty. He has his run of the neighborhood and looks  at his animal friends with their fussing humans with pity. But when a  freckle-faced girl moves into town, Oliver sees the opportunity to train  a human to provide him with a few creature comforts. And if he can help  her adjust to her life and make a new friend, that&#39;s just all in a  day&#39;s work. The real surprise comes, however, when Oliver needs Freckles  just as much as she needs him. Not a comic book and not a traditional  illustrated chapter book, &lt;i&gt;My Pet Human&lt;/i&gt; is truly a hybrid of text and art that could only come from the whimsical and brilliant mind of Yasmine Surovec." />
