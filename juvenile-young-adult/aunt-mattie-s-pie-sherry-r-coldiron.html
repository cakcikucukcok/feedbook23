  <title>Aunt Mattie’S Pie - Sherry R. Coldiron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Making stories simple and easy for children to understand has always been a priority in my writing. When a child asks for a story, you need to be able to jump right into something that is going to get their attention right away. Most of the time, they request a story with them as the main character. All children like stories about themselves. Most all of my writings are based on something that really happened in my lifetime, including ideas that sparked a fairy tale or two. There are still quite a few stories that Ive not written down yet, that I hope to have completed soon. I truly hope you enjoy reading those stories as much as I enjoy writing them. Happy reading!" />
