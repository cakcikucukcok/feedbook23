      <meta name="description" content="Krushia is the 17-year-old son of a powerful seer in the 1500s in a parallel dimension, in a place called Nusi. On Krushias seventeenth birthday, he is sent on journeys spanning time and dimensions to help people in different worlds remember knowledge and wisdom they had lost that would bring their reality to its most glorious existence. 
Krushias three best friends are with him: Sparks, Patch, and Silver. They turned into cats on this first journey, and they are gifted with knowledge, wisdom, and special abilities too. Long before Krushia was born, his father received a prophecy about him. Krushia changing genders and learning the new things he is capable of doing are a challenging thrill for Krushia. 
In this book, Krushia, as a girl, has to display her talents to the people of the new world so that they can see what they are capable of doing. The transformed Krushia and her cats have fun, show people love and joy, and perform tricks as they deliver their message of unity to this new world." />
