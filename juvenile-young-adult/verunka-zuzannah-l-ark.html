  <title>Verunka - Zuzannah L’ark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Almost daily playing with, and reading to small children, then listening to their insights, the author has realized how anachronistic her childhood became in the digital, cyberspatial age, and she decided to base the stories about 
Verunka on own recollections, meshing facts and fiction.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
For children from five to a hundred and five. In 29 chapters of various lengths, illustrated by mostly medieval woodcuts with celestial motifs.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The author, born and raised in Praga Magica, studied languages and arts, performed professionally in Europe and the USA. Writing letters was her initial and intimate mode of expression and connection. As she made the United 
States her home, English became her second language.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Zuzannah Lark has recently published two volumes of short stories, Fetching Stranded Soul Pieces and Bohemian Anthem.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
One cannot step into the same river twice for its interval has changed.
