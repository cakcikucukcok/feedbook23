  <title>The Land of Nature - Dr. Robert L. Heichberger, Sean Winburn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The land of nature all around us has a beauty and charm all on its own. The grandeur of the variety of trees, flowering shrubs, with all shades of green grasses growing in open spaces is a picture to behold. The quiet noise of the babbling and flowing clear brook waters intermingled with the chirping sounds of a wide variety of meadow birds serves as a beautiful chorus of spectacular musical blends. And then with this picture as the backdrop, added is the graceful appearance of the full range of wild life animals of all ages, in their natural surroundings and thriving habitat. The picture is breathtaking! 
There is mother rabbit and her very young, gray squirrel and her family, mother groundhog and her newborn babies, mother duck and her very young flock of ducklings, busy multicolored chipmunks gathering food for their family dinner, as well as other wildlife of nature&#39;s pride. They are all busily engaged in their daily tasks. 
This is the setting for this story, which takes place in the land of nature. This story will thoroughly captivate the attention of those who read it. And the readers heartstrings of thoughtful emotion will be moved by the dramatic events of this during one season of the life of nature&#39;s pride and joy. What a lasting impact will be yours at whatever age you happen to be as you read this story, The Land of Nature!" />
