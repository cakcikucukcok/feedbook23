  <title>The Life of Glass - Jillian Cantor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Before he died, Melissa&#39;s father told her about stars. He told her that the brightest stars weren&#39;t always the most beautiful&amp;#8212;that if people took the time to look at the smaller stars, if they looked with a telescope at the true essence of the star, they would find real beauty. But even though Melissa knows that beauty isn&#39;t only skin deep, the people around her don&#39;t seem to feel that way. There&#39;s her gorgeous sister, Ashley, who will barely acknowledge Melissa at school; there&#39;s her best friend, Ryan, who may be falling in love with the sophisticated Courtney; and there&#39;s Melissa&#39;s mother, who&#39;s dating someone new, someone Melissa knows will never be able to replace her father. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make sure she doesn&#39;t lose her father completely, Melissa spends her time trying to piece together the last of his secrets and finishing a journal he began&amp;#8212;one about love and relationships and the remarkable ways people find one another.&amp;#160;But when tragedy strikes, Melissa has to start living and loving in the present as she realizes that being beautiful on the outside doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t be beautiful on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a lyrical tale of love, loss, and self-discovery from the author of &lt;em&gt;The September Sisters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
