  <title>A Dawn Most Wicked - Susan Dennard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He has stolen Eleanor Fitt&amp;#39;s heart, but who was Daniel Sheridan before he became a Spirit-Hunter? In this suspenseful 100-page digital-original romance novella from &lt;em&gt;Something Strange and Deadly&lt;/em&gt; author Susan Dennard, Daniel&amp;#39;s past&amp;#8212;and his first love&amp;#8212;will be exposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a checkered past like Daniel Sheridan&amp;#39;s, landing an apprenticeship aboard the &lt;em&gt;Sadie Queen&lt;/em&gt; was just the fresh start he was looking for. But that&amp;#39;s the &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; thing it&amp;#39;s been. Teeming with ghosts that plague the crew with horrific nightmares, this ship is more trouble than it&amp;#39;s worth to Daniel. Except for Cass. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgeous and stubborn to a fault, apprentice pilot Cassidy Cochran is the one thing keeping Daniel on board. Though they started as best friends, their relationship has grown into something more intense. Their stolen, sometimes steamy moments have Daniel feeling something he never thought possible: &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enlisting the help of a short-tempered Chinese boy named Jie and a Creole gentleman named Joseph, the three attempt to rid the boat of the ghosts&amp;#8212;for if they don&amp;#39;t, the &lt;em&gt;Sadie Queen&lt;/em&gt; will be put out of business. And with Cass&amp;#39;s fatally-ill sister in need of expensive medical help, Daniel is more determined than ever to save the ship. But when he discovers that the ghosts are linked to a dangerous curse whose caster wants everyone on board dead, Daniel will come face-to-face with an evil so dark, so wicked, that it will change the course of his life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.&lt;/p&gt;" />
