  <title>DOCTOR DOLITTLE&#39;S POST OFFICE - book 3 in the Dr. Dolittle Series - Hugh Lofting</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Doctor Dolittle&amp;rsquo;s Post Office is the 3rd of the Doctor Dolittle illustrated stories by Hugh Lofting. The story is accompanied by 77 pen and ink drawings also done by Lofting. These have been strategically placed throughout the book to keep young minds interested in the story.&lt;br /&gt;
Set on the West Coast of Africa, Doctor Dolittle helps to capture a slave trader&amp;#39;s ship, then organizes the postal service of a small African kingdom, Fantippo, ruled over by King Koko. Over the course of later chapters, he discovers a hidden island populated by prehistoric creatures, and gets thrown into another African jail, invents animal alphabets, and defeats at least two armies. Each of the animals in the Dolittle family also tells a personal story. The postal program grows into a worldwide postal and publishing service for the benefit of animals the world over.&lt;br /&gt;
The final segment of the book is the Doctor&amp;#39;s journey to meet Mudface the Turtle, the oldest living creature on Earth, who survived the Great Flood. The extensive tale of the Great Flood is presented in a later volume of the series, Doctor Dolittle and the Secret Lake.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s profit from the sale of this book will be donated to Charities.&lt;br /&gt;
