  <title>My Dad Stared Down a Dinosaur - Brian Laws, Nathan Moya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One day in school, a little girl stands up to tell the story of how her dad took her and her sister to the park to play. There were other kids and parents having fun, too. The sun was even shiningbut none of that could protect them from the growling sound in the bushes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a dinosaur at the park! People went running and screamingbut not her dad! He stood tall and straight and stared at that angry dinosaur. The dinosaur stared right back, but Dad didnt budge. There was no way he was going to let a dinosaur hurt his girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It just goes to show that dads really are superheroes. They dont run away from loud noises or creepy critters. Dads protect their children and even deal with hungry monsters from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
