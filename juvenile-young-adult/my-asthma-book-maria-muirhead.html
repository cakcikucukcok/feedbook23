  <title>My Asthma Book - Maria Muirhead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Perfect for young children with asthma, &lt;I&gt;My Asthma Book&lt;/I&gt; is an upbeat story by author Maria Muirhead, a Certified Asthma Educator.&lt;/p&gt;
Katie has just discovered that she has asthma. The thought of using an inhaler, or puffer, makes her nervous and more than a little upset. But she has been so tired lately, and she worries that she will not be able to do all the things she loves because of her condition. She decides to talk to her older brother, Rian, who has managed his asthma for two years. In a delightful conversation, Katie and Rian talk about asthma and its triggers and discuss their fears and questions about the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
Drawing on her extensive experience with asthma education, Muirhead gently assures children that although their asthma cannot be cured, it can be controlled. The activity section of &lt;I&gt;My Asthma Book&lt;/I&gt; includes connect-the-dots, puzzles, word searches, and coloring activities with a focus on education. By explaining key concepts in asthma management and providing children with age-appropriate activities, kids who suffer from the disease will understand how asthma works and how they can continue to live normal, healthy lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
