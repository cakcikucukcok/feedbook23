  <title>I Hate You, Miss Bliss - Russell Peterson Ms, Jaydene Morrison Ms Ncc Ncsp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="is a story of a hyperactive child. Aspen has difficulty
sitting still and paying attentionparticularly in
school. She is a day-dreamer and has a different
way of processing information.
Aspens teacher is impatient and exasperated
with her apparent lack of focus. Aspen, in turn,
is upset with her teacher.
Not able to deal with the tension, Aspen runs away
from school. This is the story of how her adult friends
and their advice help her, and how her teacher learns several
ways she can assist Aspen with her unique learning style. Together,
they develop a step-by-step plan to establish a compatible program for
blending Aspens creative learning style with the regimen of school.
The world and its children are perfect the way they are.
Its how we often see them thats imperfect.
