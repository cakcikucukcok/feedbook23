  <title>Show Mode - Raquel Rivera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adina has always wanted to be a part of the annual fashion show at her school for the arts. Now that she&#39;s finally in the ninth grade, she and her friends can audition. She knows their act could be perfect. They&#39;ve got great music, gorgeous costumes and wicked dance moves. But Willow is being her usual flaky self, and Sandra&#39;s getting touchy. Maybe even a bit mean. Luckily, Seth remains steady and reliable. Their biggest competition is the annoyingly perfect Prima Donnas, who are doing everything they can to undermine Adina and her friends.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Adina is used to working hard at everything she does, including her violin, art, drama and singing classes. But her friends are getting sick of her ordering them around. They just don&#39;t get what a huge deal this is. When one of the Prima Donnas gets injured during their audition, minutes after Sandra storms off in a huff, the two groups realize that in order to succeed, they may have to work together." />
