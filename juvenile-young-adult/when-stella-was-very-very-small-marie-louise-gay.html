  <title>When Stella was Very, Very Small - Marie-Louise Gay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this book in the Stella and Sam series, Marie-Louise Gay has gone back in time to answer the questions often asked by the children who read and love the books.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Where does Stella get her wild ideas? How big is Stella&#39;s imagination? What did Stella look like when she was small? How did Stella come to be the big sister to Sam that we all know and love?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although Marie-Louise Gay didn&#39;t know what she would find when she started to explore Stella&#39;s childhood, she soon realized that when Stella was very small, she saw the world in her own unique way -- with wonder, curiosity and the sense that everything is possible. And when Sam came along, what could be more natural than to pass this sense of wonder on to him?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A story of a lovely, tiny Stella, whose world is full of small adventures and slivers of magic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
