  <title>Unwept - Tracy Hickman, Laura Hickman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unwept -- &lt;/i&gt;the beginning of a spellbinding new trilogy by Tracy Hickman and Laura Hickman bestselling co-creators of &lt;i&gt;Dragonlance &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Ravenloft&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gamin, Maine, is a remote seaside town where everyone seems to know Ellis Harkington better than she knows herself--but she doesn&#39;t remember any of them.&lt;br&gt;Unknown events have robbed Ellis of her memory. Concerned individuals, who claim to be friends and loved ones, insist that she simply needs to recuperate, and that her memories may return in time. But, for her own sake--so they claim--they refuse to divulge what has brought her to this state.&lt;br&gt;Ellis finds herself adrift in a town of ominous mysteries, cryptic hints, and disturbingly familiar strangers. The Nightbirds, a clique of fashionable young men and women, claim her as one of their own, but who can she truly trust? And what of the phantom suitor who visits her in her dreams? Is he a memory, a figment of her imagination, or a living nightmare beyond rational explanation?Only her lost past holds the answers she seeks--if she can uncover its secrets before she falls prey to an unearthly killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
