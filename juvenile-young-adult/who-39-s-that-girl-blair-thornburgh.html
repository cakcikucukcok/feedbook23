  <title>Who&#39;s That Girl - Blair Thornburgh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This laugh-out-loud debut is filled with hilarious awkward encounters, a supportive LGBTQ organization, and too many cheesy lyrics to count&amp;#8212;all with the compulsive readability of &lt;em&gt;Audrey, Wait! &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boy Meets Boy.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Junior Nattie McCullough has always been that under-the-radar straight girl who hangs out in the cafeteria with her gay-straight alliance friends. She&amp;#8217;s never been the girl that gets the guy, let alone the girl that gets a &lt;em&gt;hit song&lt;/em&gt; named after her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when last summer&amp;#8217;s crush, smoking-hot musician Sebastian Delacroix&amp;#8212;who has recently hit the mainstream big-time&amp;#8212;returns home to play a local show, that&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;what she gets. He and his band, the Young Lungs, have written a chart-topping single&amp;#8212;&amp;#8220;Natalie&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;which instantly makes Nattie second guess everything she thought about their awkward non-kiss at that June pool party. That it was horrific. That it meant nothing. That Sebastian never gave her another thought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help keep her mind off of Sebastian and his maybe-about-her, maybe-not-about-her song, Nattie throws herself into planning the school&amp;#8217;s LGBTQIA dance. That proves problematic, too, when Nattie begins to develop feelings for her good friend Zach. With the song getting major airplay and her once-normal life starting to resemble the cover of a gossip magazine, Nattie is determined to figure out once and for all if her brief moment with Sebastian was the stuff love songs are made of&amp;#8212;or just a one-hit wonder. &lt;/p&gt;" />
