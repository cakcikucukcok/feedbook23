&lt;p&gt;A BASEBALL STORY ABOUT TWO BOYS AND A YOUNG GIRL WHO HAS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. A STORY YOU MUST READ!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Long Talking Baseball is a story of two delightful young boys who have enjoyed learning and playing baseball with the help of their talking ball. But, trouble came their way when they accidentally lost their baseball. In hunting desperately for the ball, they stumbled across a young girl over a fence sitting in a wheelchair. Thinking that she may have seen a team playing earlier and hoping a player on that team hit the ball in her direction, they climbed over the fence to find out. They politely introduced themselves; then asked, Did you happen to see a team playing on the other side of the fence and did one of their players hit a ball toward you? She answered, As a matter of fact, a hitter slammed the ball over the fence and it landed in the grass next to me. When I bent over to pick the ball up, it even spoke to me. The boys knew then that they had found their ball. The girl, held up the ball, trying to return it to the boys. But, as she tried to hand the ball to Jake and Noah, her blanket slipped and the boys could see her badly deformed legs. Noticing their looks, she told them, I have Multiple Schlerosis and my doctor said that Ill never walk again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake and Noah refused to accept the ball. They told Samantha, our ball can help you just as it helped us. It will help you to exercise and maybe someday you will walk again. We will say some prayers for you. Meanwhile, we will see you again, we promise. Certainly, well take you on the MS walk, along with the ball, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boys turned to walk away, but took a moment to say their good-bys to the ball. Tears were in their eyes as they said, It isnt good-bye, it is just SO LONG, for now TALKING BASEBALL!&lt;/p&gt;" />
