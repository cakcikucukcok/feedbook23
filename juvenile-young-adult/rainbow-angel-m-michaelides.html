  <title>Rainbow Angel - M. Michaelides</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a far off land of Fos, an enchanting king and queen rule the land. Queen Sofia and King Savitar have many children; they love their children very, very much, so they decide to send them on an exciting adventure. Their daughter, Anthea, leaves on her journey and lands in a garden called Talia, where she is quick to make friends with a sunflower named Zo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, Anthea and Zo begin their travels through the four corners of Talia, each protected by archangels Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel, respectively. Anthea is excited that the flowers speak; she is so happy to befriend them, spreading the light of Fos wherever she goes. She also meets an orchid by the name of Grace who is planning a party for the autistic children at Sanasiels Infirmary in the Land of the Raphaels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zo and Anthea decide to help Grace spread the word about the party. They travel to the four corners, making new friends while they learn about tolerance, gratitude, and imagination. But there are dark forces in Talia known as the Erebusa group of meat-eating shrubs. In order to make it home, Anthea must be careful; even so, its worth the risk to help Grace and the autistic children, all in the name of love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
