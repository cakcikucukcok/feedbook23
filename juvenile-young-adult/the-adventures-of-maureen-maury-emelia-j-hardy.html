  <title>The Adventures of Maureen &amp; Maury - Emelia J Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a very unusual children&#39;s book. You will find different dilemmas, different fears, and different obstacles. But you&#39;ll also find different solutions to all of these problems. You will be taken into a fantasy world full of hope for the children.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Some of these stories about the adventures of Maureen and Maury, a magical doll and stuffed rabbit, are based on actual events that took place, but all the stories are turned into something moving, powerful, and wonderful-and sometimes even funny!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part of all of this is that your children and even you can join in by writing to Maureen and Maury with your own ideas. Who knows, maybe they may be able to use them in their next book! Read the stories in this book and you&#39;ll see what it&#39;s all about. It&#39;s an experience we can all learn from.&lt;/p&gt;
