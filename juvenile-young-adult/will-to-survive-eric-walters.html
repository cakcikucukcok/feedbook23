  <title>Will to Survive - Eric Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adam has killed again. It had to be done, part of him knows that, but it changes a person. It can certainly change a teenager who&#39;s already grown up too quickly, too harshly, in the wake of the catastrophic global blackout five months ago. In the name of safety and survival, Adam and his neighbors have turned their middle American suburban neighborhood into a fortress, defending against countless enemies. Adam wants to hope, wants to be what his girlfriend Lori wants him to be--but there&#39;s always a threat tugging at the edges of his consciousness.What&#39;s lurking in the dark is a greater danger than ever before: somebody who wants to destroy the Neighborhood and stop their strategic alignments with other powerful enclaves. More than that, though, it&#39;s personal: this somebody wants to destroy Adam. And he knows his prey is already wounded. Soon, the hunted becomes the hunter . . . and Adam hates himself for what he will have to do. Because sometimes even the dark is not cover enough for things that would never happen in the light." />
