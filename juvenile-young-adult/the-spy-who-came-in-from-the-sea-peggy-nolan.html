  <title>The Spy Who Came in from the Sea - Peggy Nolan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fourteen-year old Frank Hollahan moves to Florida in 1943, at the height of World War II, to join his father, a navy seaman. When Frank and his mother arrive at the busy naval port of Jacksonville, a surprising new life awaits them. In this new place, Frank&#39;s life changes in ways he never imagined. In his new school, his tendency toward exaggeration quickly builds him a reputation as a teller of tales. He wanders to the beach one night and sees what seems to be a man coming ashore from a submarine. When he informs his family, friends, and teachers that he saw a spy from a German U-boat land on the local beach, no one believes him. Is the spy real, or is he only a part of Frank&#39;s imagination and exaggeration? Frank is certain the spy has plans for sabotage. With the aid of Rosemarie Twekenberry, who has eyes only for Frank, and a mysterious beach recluse known as Weird Wanda, Frank sets out to prove the spy&#39;s existence. With time running out, Frank must figure out a way to stop him. Each rumor and discovery-whether a buried chest, a secret code, or a mysterious note-presents new problems. &lt;p&gt;  The truth finally comes to light at the big bond rally in the shipyard as Frank&#39;s class presents a rousing patriotic program, led by Mr. Jolly, an ex-clown turned teacher. Thrown into the mix are a brash, redheaded student named Howard; Gladys, the organizer; and other zany characters who all join in the tangled web of this wartime mystery, based on an actual occurrence. &lt;i&gt;The Spy Who Came in from the Sea&lt;/i&gt; ends up teaching Frank-and the people of Jacksonville-valuable lessons about friendship, perseverance, and the power of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
