  <title>One - Michael Fitzalan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stephen was the only one. He thought running away would help but that was not the solution. The bullies at his school teased him for sleeping with a teddy bear. He was not at all sporty, at a prep school where sport was a key popularity; he had joined a term late and he found it hard to fit in; he missed his family. He was nine, his father had said he would be fine. He felt a true outsider, a stranger without a friend. The only one. Stephen had an opportunity to get revenge on one of his tormentors. He had to decide what to do. Should he try to save his enemy, or, should he let him perish? With his death, he could at least expect a silent, grudging respect from the others and to be left alone. Did Hollister deserve to perish, buried alive? One hundred and fifty boys, one hundred and forty-nine happy, one miserable, just one. Did his happiness justify taking another life? Would he be a slave or would he be free? This is a story about one boy, a bully, a dare, a school, a tunnel, a riding accident and revenge." />
