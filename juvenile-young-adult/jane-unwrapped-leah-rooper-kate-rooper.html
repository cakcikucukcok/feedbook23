  <title>Jane Unwrapped - Leah Rooper, Kate Rooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Some tombs should never be opened...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teen scientist Jane&#39;s latest experiment in living went really wrong. &lt;br&gt;After a fatal accident, Jane becomes the first modern-day mummy--and wakes up in the Egyptian underworld without a heart. With nothing to help her get into paradise, Anubis, the snarky god of embalming, wants to devour her soul. Then again, Anubis is drop-dead gorgeous, so maybe things aren&#39;t so bad after all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But a mad god offers Jane a way out of the underworld, and she only has to do the impossible--go back in time and steal King Tut&#39;s heart. Well, every experiment has variables which can end in disaster. Between posing as a priestess, trying to murder the young pharaoh, and being followed by Anubis, who can&#39;t seem to decide if he&#39;s going to kiss her or kill her, Jane has to make a choice: Do the logical thing and steal Tut&#39;s heart, or find a way to save them both...Even if it means rebelling against all the gods of Egypt in the process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Entangled Teen Crave book contains life in the name of science, the rage of a vengeful god, love against life and death, and swoon-worthy kisses. Warning: you may find yourself wishing that you,too, had died and gone to the Duat.&lt;/p&gt;" />
