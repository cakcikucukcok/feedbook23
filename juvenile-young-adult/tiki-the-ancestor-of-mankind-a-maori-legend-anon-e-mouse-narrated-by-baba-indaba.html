  <title>TIKI—THE ANCESTOR OF MANKIND - A Maori Legend - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 464&lt;br /&gt;
In this 464th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates a Maori Legend - &amp;quot;Tiki &amp;ndash; The Ancestor or Mankind&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE, UPON A TIME, a long, long time ago at the beginning of time, when Rangi-nui, the great Heaven, and Papa-tu-a-nuku, the far-stretching earth, were separated from each other, then the light shone over Papa-tu-a-nuku, the mother of Tiki, and he was the first man.&lt;br /&gt;
Great was his longing for the power to spread himself out over Papa: father of mankind he wanted to be! Far, and far, and far he wandered over Hawaiki, searching and asking, and again and again he wandered forth over all Hawaiki, his heart full of longing.&lt;br /&gt;
At last he came to the river at Hawaiki known by the name of Wai-matu-hirangi, and from the depth of his desire he cried aloud: &amp;lsquo;Oh, daughter of Hawaiki, child of the murmuring water, tell me how I may become the father of mankind. Tell me where may I obtain the power and from whom?&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And the river Wai-matu-hirangi answered him&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? What did Wai-matu-hirangi &amp;nbsp;say to Tiki? What did he have to do to achieve his dreams? Did he ever succeed? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;

Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
