  <title>THE PALACE ON THE OCEAN-BED - A Japanese Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 399&lt;br /&gt;
In this 399th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Japanese fairy tale, &amp;quot;THE PALACE ON THE OCEN-BED&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long time ago and far away lived a great hunter whose name was Ho-wori, Prince Fire-Fade, the son of Ninigi. His elder brother Ho-deri, Prince Fire-Flash, was a fisher who caught &amp;lsquo;things broad of fin and narrow of fin&amp;rsquo; but he was no hunter. Each tired of what they were assigned to do and decided to swap tasks. After a period Prince Fire-Flash realised he could not track the game, nor run swiftly, nor take good aim. Likewise Prince Fire-Fade, not catching one thing, realised he was no fisherman. The two brothers met up at the end of the day and said: &amp;ldquo;There is the luck of the mountain and there is the luck of the sea. Let each restore to the other his luck.&amp;rdquo; Ho-wori replied: &amp;ldquo;I did not catch a single fish with your hook, and now it is lost in the sea.&amp;rdquo; The elder brother was very angry, and, with many hard words, demanded the return of his treasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what happened next you ask? Was Ho-wori able to retrieve the treasured fish hook or did something else altogether happen? Did he find another sort of treasure in his search for the fish-hook? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
