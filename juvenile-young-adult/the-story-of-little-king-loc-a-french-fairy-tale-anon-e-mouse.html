  <title>THE STORY OF LITTLE KING LOC - A French Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 281&lt;br /&gt;
In this 281st issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of &amp;ldquo;Little King Loc&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; A French Children&amp;#39;s Fairy Tale&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Dukes of Clarides had always lived in the midst of their people, and protected them both in war and peace.&lt;br /&gt;
At the period when this tale begins the Duke Robert was dead, leaving a young and beautiful duchess who ruled in his stead. Of course everyone expected her to marry again, but she refused all suitors who sought her hand, saying that, having only one soul she could have only one husband, and that her baby daughter was quite enough for her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day, she was sitting in the tower, which looked out over a rocky heath, covered in summer with purple and yellow flowers, when she beheld a troop of horsemen riding towards the castle. In the midst, seated on a white horse with black and silver trappings, was a lady whom the duchess at once knew to be her friend the Countess of Blanchelande, a young widow like herself, mother of a little boy two years older than Abeille des Clarides. The duchess hailed her arrival with delight, but her joy was soon turned into weeping when the countess sank down beside her on a pile of cushions, and told the reason of her visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;As you know,&amp;rsquo; she said, taking her friend&amp;rsquo;s hand and pressing it between her own, &amp;lsquo;whenever a Countess of Blanchelande is about to die she finds a white rose lying on her pillow. Last night I went to bed feeling unusually happy, but this morning when I woke the rose was resting against my cheek. I have no one to help me in the world but you, and I have come to ask if you will take Youri my son, and let him be a brother to Abeille?&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So Youri and Abeille grew up side by side, and the duchess faithfully kept her promise, and was a mother to them both. As they got bigger she often took them with her on her journeys through her duchy, and taught them to know her people, and to pity and to aid them.&lt;br /&gt;
It was on one of these journeys that, after passing through meadows covered with flowers, Youri caught sight of a great glittering expanse lying beneath some distant mountains.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;What is that, godmother?&amp;rsquo; he asked, waving his hand. &amp;lsquo;The shield of a giant, I suppose.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;No; a silver plate as big as the moon!&amp;rsquo; said Abeille, twisting herself round on her pony.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;It is neither a silver plate nor a giant&amp;rsquo;s shield,&amp;rsquo; replied the duchess; &amp;lsquo;but a beautiful lake. Still, in spite of its beauty, it is dangerous to go near it, for in its depths dwell some Undines, or water spirits, who lure all passers-by to their deaths.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, being young, energetic and inquisitive young people, both Youri and Abeille decided to investigate the lake and made plans to ride by and look for themselves. And that&amp;rsquo;s where this adventure begins&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened to Youri and Abeille? Were they lured to their deaths or did they somehow manage to escape the evil clutches of the Undines? Well, to find out you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to download and read the story for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
