Almost finished upon her death in 2011, the manuscript was completed by Diana&#39;s sister Ursula Jones, an acclaimed novelist and actress. &lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; called &lt;em&gt;The Islands of Chaldea&lt;/em&gt; &quot;a story to cherish&quot; in their starred review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aileen comes from a long line of magic makers, and her aunt Beck is the most powerful magician on Skarr. But Aileen&#39;s magic has yet to reveal itself, even though she is old enough and it should have by now. When Aileen is sent over the sea on a mission for the King, she worries that she&#39;ll be useless and in the way. A powerful talking cat changes all of that&amp;#8212;and with every obstacle Aileen faces, she becomes stronger and more confident, until her magic blooms.
