  <title>THE LADY OF THE SNOW - a Japanese Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 421&lt;br /&gt;
In this 421st issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE LADY OF THE SNOW&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
Winter time in Japan, and it&amp;rsquo;s snow scapes, has a beauty peculiarly its own, and it is a favourite theme of Japanese poets and artists.&lt;br /&gt;
The deity, Yuki-Onna, is also known as the &amp;nbsp;Lady of the Snow and it is with her in mind we stat our story&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
Mosaku and his apprentice Minokichi journeyed to a forest, some little distance from their village. They desired to cross this river, but the ferryman had gone away, leaving his boat on the other side of the water. As it was too cold to consider swimming across the river they were glad to take shelter in the ferryman&amp;#39;s little hut.&lt;br /&gt;
On entering, one fell into a slumber while the other lay awake listening to the wind howling through the trees. All of a sudden the door was blown open, and a fair woman, in dazzlingly white garments, stood in the hut. For a moment she stood thus; then she bent over Mosaku, her breath coming forth like white smoke. After bending thus over the old man for a minute or two she turned to Minokichi and hovered over him.&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? To find the answers to this question, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story and find out for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;
INCLUDES LINKS TO DOWNLOAD 8 FREE STORIES&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. &amp;ldquo;Baba Indaba&amp;rdquo; translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
