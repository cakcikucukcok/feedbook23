  <title>Jake and Julia Find the Puppy’S Home - Ed Goebig, Ivy Marie Apa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jake and Julia love to play outside, so moving to their new house with a big yard made them very happy. One day while playing outside on a nice sunny day, a little puppy ran up to see them. Since Jake and Julias family had just moved to the new neighborhood, they have never seen the puppy before. Having had a dog before, they were very friendly to the puppy. The puppy was just as friendly to them. They were petting the puppy for a few minutes assuming its owner would soon arrive. To their surprise no one showed. The puppy did not have a collar or tag so Jake and Julia did not know where the puppy lived. Instead of asking their Dad for help, they decided to help the puppy on their own. Julia came up with the idea to go door to door to find the puppys family.  Jake and Julia were on a mission to help this lost puppy. After they set off, their Dad came outside and the kids were nowhere to be found. Their Dad called their names a couple times and did not get a response. As Jake and Julias Father began to get a little nervous, his next door neighbor came outside. He told their Father two kids just came to their door with a puppy to ask if it lived there. The puppy did not live there so the kids continued on. The neighbor said the kids headed across the street. As their Father left the neighbors house, he sees Jake and Julia running up their driveway. As he meets up with his kids, they were so excited about what they did. Jake says, we found a lost puppy his home and his name is Sam!  While their Father was proud for what they did, he did explain to Jake and Julia they are not allowed to leave the yard without telling him.  The next day, Sam was being walked by his owner when he sees Jake and Julia playing outside. This time he is on a leash and brings his owner to the kids to say hi and thanks for finding his home." />
