  <title>The Curse of the Diamond Hand - Kevin Cantillano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;It is the journey of a princess and a cowboy. The princess, who is destined to become a great queen for her kingdom. A time where many kingdoms fight over an absolute power that lies beneath a cavern filled with dragons. Many have dared to grab that absolute power, but many have failed. She as a child dared to grab this power, a power in the form of a key, and she would gain this absolute power later on as a young woman.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However, she takes upon a curse from that absolute power, in the shape of a hand. Through her recklessness and ambitious needs, she uplifts the curse to not only herself, but the curse interwines to the very foundation of the world. Her curse impacts not only her destiny, but the world as well for the next centuries to come.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It is until she meets a cowboy many years later, who is living in the sins of his past, that hope is brought upon her. The stranger also has that opportunity, the opportunity to make things right and gain peace within himself with the princess, who can finally end her curse. However, together they also set out to bring an end to the curse that the world is living in.&lt;/P&gt;" />
