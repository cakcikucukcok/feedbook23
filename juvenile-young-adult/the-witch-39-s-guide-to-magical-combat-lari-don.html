  <title>The Witch&#39;s Guide to Magical Combat - Lari Don</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Molly&#39;s shape-shifting curse is getting stronger and more unpredictable. Becoming a hare she could cope with. At least she could run... fast. But now she&#39;s turning into the prey of any predator she hears. Life&#39;s pretty dangerous if you become a worm whenever you hear a bird tweet.
As Molly and her friends search for a stone that can curb the Promise Keeper&#39;s powers, and each one of them must face their own monster, Molly is forced to choose: is she prepared to use dark magic to break her curse? Will she become a witch and enter into magical combat? And if she does, will she lose the friendships she most cares about?
In this third and final thrilling instalment of the breathtaking Spellchasers trilogy the team faces a blizzard of powerful threats. Can they bring balance to the magical world, defeat the creatures that pursue them and finally break Molly&#39;s curse? Or will darkness triumph over friendship?" />
