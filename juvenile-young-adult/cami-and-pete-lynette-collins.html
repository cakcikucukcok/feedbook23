  <title>Cami and Pete - Lynette Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cami is a shy little boy who has just started school. So far, due to his shyness, he hasnt made any friends. Its not that he doesnt want friends. He does, but hes just too nervous! One day, he makes a wish. Imagine his incredible excitement when the wish comes truejust not quite in the way little Cami guessed.
Within a moment of Cami making his wish, up jumps a magical frog whose name is Pete. Unlike other frogs, Pete can talk, and the two become best friends. They get themselves into a little bit of troublenot because they were naughtybut because they were trying to help!
Thankfully, Camis mom sees the humor in it all and doesnt get angry with her son and his new best pal. Many young children are shy and have difficulty making friends, so they will understand what Cami is going through. Plus, its a valuable lesson to be learned that when were kind to others, well find friends all around." />
