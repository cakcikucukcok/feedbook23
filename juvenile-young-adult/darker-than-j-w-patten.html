  <title>Darker Than - J.W. Patten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Where am I? asked Winter. And where&#39;s thatwolf-thingyou were with...?
Please, call me Lucius, he said serenely. And that &#39;wolf-thing&#39;, as you keep calling him, really is my friend. To put this rather bluntly: Jerome is a werewolf.&quot;
Oh sure, she scoffed. Rightand I suppose you&#39;re a werewolf too...?!
No, my dearI am a vampire.
At seventeen, Winter Banos had her world figured out. She had a dream, and a future, all her own. All that changed the day she met Lucius and Jerome.
Now, Winter has fallen into a new world; one where magic is real.
A world where Vampires wont drink human blood, and Werewolves can&#39;t transform
under the full moon.
A world with an ancient secret, guarded by a mysterious Witch.
It is also a world where Winter is hunted.
Winter doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s happened to her life, or why.
But when the cold steals her strength, and turns her blood to ice,
Winter will realize the real world is darker than anything she has ever known
For truly, here there be Monsters...&lt;/p&gt;" />
