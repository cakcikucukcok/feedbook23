  <title>THE PRINCE AND THE THREE FATES - An Ancient Egyptian Fairy Tale - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 291&lt;br /&gt;
In this 291st issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Egyptian story of &amp;ldquo;THE PRINCE AND THE THREE FATES&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
A son is born to great Egyptian pharaoh but when the fairies visit to bless this future ruler, they tell the pharaoh &amp;lsquo;It is written in the books of fate that he must die, either by a crocodile, or a serpent, or by a dog. If we could save him we would; but that is beyond our power.&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
So the pharaoh builds a high tower and with a sad heart places his son in the most inaccessible room with round-the-clock guards to protect him.&lt;br /&gt;
Time passes and the son grows into a fine young man. Straight limbed and handsome. He tells his father, &amp;ldquo;I know all about the prophecy that was made at my birth, but I would far rather be killed at once than live an idle, useless life here. So give me arms, and let me go, I pray you; me and my dog too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Realising the prince is right, with a heavy heart the pharaoh grants his wish and sets his son free.&lt;br /&gt;
What follows recounts the journeys and adventures of the young prince finding his way in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
Does the prince survive? Can he overcome and break the curse that is written in the book of fates? Does he fall in love and, does his path cross that of a crocodile, serpent or dog &amp;ndash; or maybe all three?&lt;br /&gt;
Download and read the story to find the answers to these questions and if the prince returns home safely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
