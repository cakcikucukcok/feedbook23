  <title>4 Keys to Unlock a Sad Heart - Doris M. Arwine, Violeta Honasan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="4 Keys to Unlock a Sad Heart, A childhood loss set the stage for this book. The author experienced a household fire at five years old. The oldest sister was six and youngest was three years old at the same time of the fire. It was a traumatic time for the family but they grew stronger from the losses they experienced. Grandpa, in the book, instructs us on how to unlock our sad hearts (grieve our losses) with the 4 keys. The 4 keys teach us how to Think about our memories. Then we Write out our thoughts and feelings, and what we are thankful for. The next key teaches us to Talk to safe friends about our losses. The last Key is to Weep or cry. It has a very cleansing effect. The book also teaches us to make an appointment with grief so it doesnt overwhelm us. A happy and successful life often follows the grief process." />
