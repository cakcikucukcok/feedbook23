  <title>A Greyhound of a Girl - Roddy Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Mary O&#39;Hara is a sharp and cheeky 12-year-old Dublin schoolgirl who is bravely facing the fact that her beloved Granny is dying. But Granny can&#39;t let go of life, and when a mysterious young woman turns up in Mary&#39;s street with a message for her Granny, Mary gets pulled into an unlikely adventure. The woman is the ghost of Granny&#39;s own mother, who has come to help her daughter say good-bye to her loved ones and guide her safely out of this world. She needs the help of Mary and her mother, Scarlett, who embark on a road trip to the past. Four generations of women travel on a midnight car journey. One of them is dead, one of them is dying, one of them is driving, and one of them is just starting out.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;b&gt;STARRED REVIEW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&quot;A warm, witty, exquisitely nuanced multigenerational story.+?&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;STARRED REVIEW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&quot;This elegantly constructed yet beautifully simple story, set in Ireland and spun with affection by Booker Prize+&quot;winner Doyle, will be something different for YA readers. These four lilting voices will linger long after the book is closed.+?&lt;br&gt;
+&quot;&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;STARRED REVIEW&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Written mostly in dialogue, at which Doyle excels, and populated with a charming foursome of Irish women, this lovely tale is as much about overcoming the fear of death as it is about death itself.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
+&quot;&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;In this moving and artfully structured ghost tale, four generations of Irish women come together. A big part of the pleasure here is the rhythm of the language and the contrasting voices of the generations. Any opportunity to read it aloud would be a treat.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
+&quot;&lt;i&gt;Horn Book&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;For children grieving the death of a parent or grandparent, this book provides comfort.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
