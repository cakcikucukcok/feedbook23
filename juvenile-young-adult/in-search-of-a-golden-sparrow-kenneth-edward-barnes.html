  <title>In Search of a Golden Sparrow - Kenneth Edward Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Search of a Golden Sparrow&lt;/i&gt; is a heartwarming story about seven-year-old Jeremy. He lives in rural America during the later years of the Great Depression and must struggle on crutches, for he was born crippled.&lt;/p&gt; 
     &lt;p&gt;When he finds a baby sparrow that has fallen from its nest and died, he feels sorry for the tiny helpless bird, but no one else seems to care. Later, events in his life cause him to feel worthless and helpless, like the little bird.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;His grandmother tells him that God cares about him and the little bird, and even said; He sees the sparrow fall. But Jeremy asks, Ifn He saw it fall Grammaw, how come He let it die? And how come I was born crippled?&lt;/p&gt;  
     &lt;p&gt;She tells him about heaven, its golden streets, and that he is more precious than gold. She also tells him, in heaven everything will be beautiful and that he wont be crippled. Thinking God might change the little bird into a golden one, Cause they aint too purty down here, he asks God to send him a golden sparrow. That way, hell know God hears him, loves him, and that he wont be crippled in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;During his search for a golden sparrow, his faith touches many, from an old man Hermit Bill, to Scotty Simmons (a kid who makes fun of him).&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;The story was written, because during a difficult time in my life, I had asked God to give me something to write about that will touch peoples hearts.          A week later, I happen to see a white sparrow with gold wing patches. Then after I had already begun the book, I found with the white one, a real golden sparrow!&lt;/p&gt;" />
