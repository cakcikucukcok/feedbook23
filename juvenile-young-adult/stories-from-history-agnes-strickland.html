  <title>Stories from History - Agnes Strickland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The early history of England, or Britain, as it was anciently called, is involved in great obscurity. The reason of this is, that its first inhabitants, a colony from some other nation, were so much occupied in providing for the actual wants of life, as to have but very little time to spare for the purpose of preserving records of the country whence they came. They were, too, in a state of barbarism, and altogether ignorant of the arts of reading or writing. When they wished to keep a memorial of any great event, such as a victory, a treaty of peace, the death of one king, or the coronation of another, they marked the spot where the occurrence took place with a heap of stones, or set up a rough hewn pillar, and bade their children recount to their descendants the circumstance which it was intended to commemorate. An imperfect memory of certain great events was thus kept alive, and the pillar, or the heap of stones, was appealed to as a memorial, long after the people who had assisted in raising it were dead.&lt;br /&gt;
The traditions connected with these rude memorials are the only sources from which our knowledge of some very ancient events is to be derived. They are called&lt;i&gt;traditions&lt;/i&gt;, because they were not written accounts, but such as were transmitted, or handed down, through a long succession of ages, by being repeated from father to son. Sometimes, too, these traditions were made into songs, which, being easily learned by heart, very much assisted in preserving a knowledge of the events they were intended to record.&lt;br /&gt;
Julius C&amp;aelig;sar, the great Roman dictator, or, as he is by some called, the first emperor of Rome, invaded and conquered Britain, and in a great measure brought it under the yoke of Rome. This Julius C&amp;aelig;sar, who wrote the history of his own wars and conquests, is the first real historian who has made mention of the Britons. He calls them barbarians,&amp;mdash;and so, in comparison with the Romans, at that time the most civilized people in the world, they certainly were,&amp;mdash;yet, from many circumstances which he himself mentions, it is certain that they were acquainted with the art of working mines, the use of metals, and the construction of many curious and useful articles.&lt;br /&gt;
