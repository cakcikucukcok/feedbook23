  <title>Play Me - Laura Ruby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eddy knows how to play the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is, after all, the writer, director, and cameraman&amp;#8212;the mastermind, really&amp;#8212;behind the hit online TV show &lt;em&gt;Riot Grrl 16&lt;/em&gt;. When it wins a contest to be aired on MTV (and it obviously will&amp;#8212;have you &lt;em&gt;seen&lt;/em&gt; the competition?), he&#39;ll be famous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s the game of love. Eddy knows all the tricks, and his favorite girls are the ones with the fishnets and cherry lipstick and legs up to there. The ones who know he doesn&#39;t make any promises. The ones who are cool with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as graduation looms, everything and everyone starts deviating from Eddy&#39;s master script. Never in a million years did he expect to be facing off again with the unapproachable, perfect Lucinda Dulko. For once in his life, he&#39;s not in control&amp;#8212;and to be with Lucinda, he&#39;s willing to get swept up in the game. But what happens to a player when the rules suddenly change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Eddy find a way to win it all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or will he get played?&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Play Me - Laura Ruby</i></b> | Play Me, a narration by Laura Ruby was written to entertain the reader, whether it may be a boy or a girl. Throughout the story Ruby maintained a steady theme, using the character Eddy Rochester, she showed that high school love can be easily compared to a game. Though not everyone has to play that game, Eddy Rochester chose not too.<br /><b><i>Play Me by Laura Ruby - goodreads.com</i></b> | Play Me. Eddy Rochester has a problem. It’s not his TV-star mom, who skipped town with a creep and appears on Crime Scene: Miami in tops cut so low you can see all the way to China. And it’s not his dad, who’s nearly pines himself into a box for Eddy’s mom, or his stepdad, who pines right along with him.<br /><b><i>Play Me | Author Laura Ruby</i></b> | I own all of Laura Ruby's books (Good Girls, Bad Apple, &amp; Play Me) but haven't read any until Play Me. The narrator was male, which made me like the book a little better. I don't think I would have liked it as much if Lucinda or Gina was the narrator.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Play Me - Laura Ruby</a> </h3></p><hr/>
