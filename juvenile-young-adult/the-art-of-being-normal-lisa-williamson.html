  <title>The Art of Being Normal - Lisa Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An inspiring and timely debut novel from Lisa Williamson, &lt;i&gt;The Art of Being Normal&lt;/i&gt; is about two transgender friends who figure out   how to navigate teen life with help from each other. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David Piper has always been an outsider. His parents think he&#39;s gay. The  school bully thinks he&#39;s a freak. Only his two best friends know the  real truth: David wants to be a girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the first day at his new  school Leo Denton has one goal: to be invisible. Attracting the  attention of the most beautiful girl in his class is definitely not part  of that plan. When Leo stands up for David in a fight, an unlikely  friendship forms. But things are about to get messy. Because at Eden  Park School secrets have a funny habit of not staying secret for long ,  and soon everyone knows that Leo used to be a girl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As David prepares  to come out to his family and transition into life as a girl and Leo  wrestles with figuring out how to deal with people who try to define him  through his history, they find in each other the friendship and support  they need  to navigate life as transgender teens as well as the courage  to decide for themselves what normal really means.&lt;/p&gt;" />
