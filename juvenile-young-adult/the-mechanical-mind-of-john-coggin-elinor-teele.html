  <title>The Mechanical Mind of John Coggin - Elinor Teele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Roald Dahl meets &lt;em&gt;The Penderwicks&lt;/em&gt; in this quirky, humorous, whimsical, and heartwarming middle grade debut about two siblings who run away from home to escape working in the family coffin business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Coggin is no ordinary boy. He is devising an invention that nobody has ever seen before, something that just might change the world, or at least make life a little bit better for him and his little sister, Page. But that&amp;#8217;s only when he can sneak a break from his loathsome job&amp;#8212;building coffins for the family business under the beady gaze of his cruel Great-Aunt Beauregard.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Great-Aunt Beauregard informs John that she&amp;#8217;s going to make him a permanent partner in Coggin Family Coffins&amp;#8212;and train Page to be an undertaker&amp;#8212;John and Page hit the road. Before long, they&amp;#8217;ve fallen in with a host of colorful characters, all of whom, like John and Page, are in search of a place they can call home. But home isn&amp;#8217;t something you find so much as something you fight for, and John soon realizes that he and Page are in for the fight of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
