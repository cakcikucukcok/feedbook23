  <title>Betsy at the General Store - Ann Fisher, Sonny Heston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I remembered sitting in that two-room schoolhouse, just as if it was yesterday. Mrs. Biggs would read about George Washington crossing the Delaware. The weather was terrible, and his men had no shoes or coats, and their clothes were in rags. They kept marching to defend America from the Brits. We won that war. We were a free nation. She would read the stories about our history. The pilgrims and the American Indians shared that first Thanksgiving. The Indians had taught the pilgrims to plant corn and hunt for wild game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Biggs started our school day saying the Lords Prayer and the Pledge Allegiance to our flag. That was her way of teaching us how thankful we were to live in a wonderful country like America. Mrs. Biggs decided she wanted her student to know the 23rd Psalm. Each day, we would practice until each student was able to stand before class and recite the 23rd Psalm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would push Betsy to school in her little buggy and show her to my friends. Mrs. Biggs would put Betsy in her lap while she read Bambi to us. These are very fond memories. I hope all the children will love Betsy as I did when you read about our adventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have dedicated my books to my friend, Linda Gaines Williams, and Jill Williams, a very special person.&lt;/p&gt;" />
