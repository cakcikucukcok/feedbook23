  <title>Ladybugs on a Mission - Hilda L. L. Trevi単o</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inside a tree in the outskirts of Missionville, Texas, orange ladybugs Trey and Shelly Bopper snore peacefully in their twiggy bed, unaware that swarms of hungry aphids are moving outside their home. Just as they are awakened by the strange humming sound, Trey and Shelly realize that their pupae are hatching; they have just become the proud parents of Leggy, Antenny, and Tribeetleye, who are each unique and beautiful in their own way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrilled that he and Shelly now have three helpers to assist in fending off the invaders, Trey still cannot help but worry about his little ones ability to fight the aphids and predators because of their unusual features. Even so, Shelly convinces him to train Leggy, who has thick furry legs; Antenny, who has unusually long antennae; and Tribeetleye, who has an extra eye but is missing one leg. When theyre ready, they all embark on a dangerous mission to gobble the aphids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this delightful childrens tale, the Bopper family must draw on their love of family and trust in each others strengths as they courageously confront dragonflies, wasps, a jumping spider, and a pirate bug in a brave attempt to save their home and one of their own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
