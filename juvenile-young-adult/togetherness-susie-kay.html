  <title>Togetherness - Susie Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book starts off with three small forest creatures of different sorts who are not usually seen together. They become friends while walking through the forest. Only the wisest one knows the way but will not give up the secret of where they are heading. The youngest, a rabbit, is very excitable and has never had any friends and gets into some trouble. The oldest, a frog, is weary and tired but has never heard of or been to this place they are going to. The turtle has made the trip many times and knows the way. These three companions are in for a great surprise! Its a lesson for small children that anyone can be friends and that there is safety in staying together and helping one another and that as we grow, we mingle with peers of our own." />
