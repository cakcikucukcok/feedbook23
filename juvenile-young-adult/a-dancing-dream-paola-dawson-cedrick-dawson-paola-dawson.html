  <title>A Dancing Dream - Paola Dawson, Cedrick Dawson, Paola Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Dancing Dream&lt;/em&gt; carries a powerful message to the heart and mind of a young dreamer. It encourages the pursuit of ones dream through perseverance and dedication, while keeping kindness and generosity equally vivid. The story of Daisy, a young girl full of energy who dreams of becoming a great dancer, is unfolded through the lens of a fantasy world and our modern reality. Underlining the fantasy aspect of this story is a subtle spiritual context.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Although Daisy grows up to follow the path her mother has chosen for her, a series of odd coincidences re-ignites the flame that never stopped burning in her heart.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;It takes a lot of courage, willpower, and a visit from Dream Man, the one who knows everyones dreams and how to make them come true, for Daisy to take a step, twirl, and pirouette toward achieving her dream. Along the way, Daisys determination is thwarted by her selfishness, which keeps her from moving forward. She struggles to find her way back to what Dream Man has advised her to do and to fulfill the masters plan. Once Daisy gets back on track with a pure heart, she soars through the strenuous training, all leading up to a pivotal point: audition day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;The reader comes to find out that things dont always happen as planned. But if you follow your dreams with your heart and soul, it doesnt matter how many unexpected twists and turns come along your path; the destination will be the same.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the end of the book, you will find helpful, practical steps for you to fulfill your own dream.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
