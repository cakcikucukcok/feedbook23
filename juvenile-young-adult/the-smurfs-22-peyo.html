  <title>The Smurfs #22 - Peyo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All&#39;s not well in Smurfs Village. Someone is actually proposing to build an actual wall around the Smurfs Village! Can you imagine any smurf saying such a crazy thing? Well, it all started when Papa Smurf observed that his Smurfs were fighting with each other and he concluded something needed to be done. And that&#39;s when the trouble started. Papa Smurf creates negative versions of all the Smurfs. They&#39;re just like the regular Smurfs except their clothes are a little darker and they don&#39;t have any of the good qualities of the real Smurfs. For example, a black-haired Smurfette has all of Smurfette&#39;s bad habits, and none of what&#39;s good about Smurfette! When the Smurfs meet the so-called &quot;Grey Smurfs,&quot; they want to be friends. But the Grey Smurfs are only interested in going to war against the Smurfs, conquering them, and turning them all into their slaves. Can Papa Smurf fix this mess he created?" />
