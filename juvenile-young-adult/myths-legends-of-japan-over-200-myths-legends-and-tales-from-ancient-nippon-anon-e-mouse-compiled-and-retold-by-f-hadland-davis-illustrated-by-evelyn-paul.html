  <title>MYTHS &amp; LEGENDS OF JAPAN - over 200 Myths, Legends and Tales from Ancient Nippon - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and retold by F. Hadland Davis, Illustrated by Evelyn Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;i&gt;Seas and Lands&lt;/i&gt;, Sir Edwin Arnold gave us the impression that Japan was a real fairyland in the Far East. And he was correct. Herein you will find over 200 magical myths, legends, tales and fables of Japanese deities from the time before the world was brought into being. F. Hadland Davis has categorised these stories, tales and fables into 31 chapters which are accompanied by 32 glorious full-page colour plates by Evelyn Paul, quite unlike any others we have seen in children&amp;rsquo;s illustrated books.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein are stories like: Ama-Terasu And Susa-No-O, The Divine Messengers, Yorimasa, The Goblin Of Oyeyama, The Triumph Of Momotaro, &amp;quot;My Lord Bag Of Rice&amp;quot;, The Coming Of The Lady Kaguya, The Legend Of The Golden Lotus, How Tokutaro Was Deluded&amp;nbsp; By Foxes, The Significance Of Jiz?, The Treasure Ship, Sentaro&amp;#39;s Visit&amp;nbsp; To The Land Of Perpetual Youth, A Woman And The Bell Of Miidera, The Snow-Bride and, oh, so many more exquisite tales like these.&lt;br /&gt;
Ama-terasu is the central figure in Japanese mythology, for it is from the Sun Goddess that the Mikados are descended, and it is here where this volume starts.&amp;nbsp; Early heroes and warriors are always regarded as minor divinities, and the very nature of Shint?ism, associated with ancestor worship, has enriched those of Japan with many a fascinating legend.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Chinese called Japan Jih-p&amp;eacute;n, &amp;quot;the place the sun comes from,&amp;quot; because the archipelago was situated on the east of their own kingdom, and our words Japan and Nippon are corruptions of Jih-p&amp;eacute;n. Marco Polo called the country Zipangu, and one ancient name describes it as &amp;quot;The-Luxuriant-Reed-Plains-the-land-of-Fresh-Rice-Ears-of-a-Thousand-Autumns-of-Long-Five-Hundred-Autumns.&amp;quot; We are not surprised to find that such a very lengthy and descriptive title is not used by the Japanese to-day; but it is of interest to know that the old word for Japan, Yamato, is still frequently employed, Yamato Damashii signifying &amp;quot;The Spirit of Unconquerable Japan.&amp;quot; Then, again, we still hear Japan referred to as The Island of the Dragon-fly. We are told in the old Japanese Chronicles that the Emperor, in 630 B.C., ascended a hill called Waki Kamu no Hatsuma, from which he was able to view the land on all sides. He was much impressed by the beauty of the country, and said that it resembled &amp;quot;a dragon-fly licking its hinder parts,&amp;quot; and the Island received the name of Akitsu-Shima which translates as &amp;quot;Island of the Dragon-fly&amp;quot; - and so it has remained for millennia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To-day we hear a good deal about the New Japan, and we are too prone to forget the significance of the Old upon which modern Japan has been founded. This volume will give you an insight as to why modern Japan is like it is.&lt;br /&gt;
So, we invite you to download and curl up with this unique sliver of Eastern culture not seen in print for over a century; and immerse yourself in the tales and fables of yesteryear for we are certain that once picked up, you won&amp;rsquo;t be able to put it down.&lt;br /&gt;
