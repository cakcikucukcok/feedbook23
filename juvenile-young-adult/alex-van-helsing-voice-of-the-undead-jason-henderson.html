  <title>Alex Van Helsing: Voice of the Undead - Jason Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Now that Alex is in the know about the deadly vampires that live&amp;#8212;and hunt&amp;#8212;around his boarding school, everything is different. Putting his talents to use, Alex is training with the Polidorium to become a vampire hunter, just like his Van Helsing ancestors. Sure, he&amp;#8217;s only fourteen, but c&amp;#8217;mon: This runs in his blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Alex is wondering if he&amp;#8217;ll live long enough to succeed. His archnemesis Elle, a vampire whose youthful appearance and blond hair disguise a rage that&amp;#8217;s directed at &lt;em&gt;him&lt;/em&gt;, is out to get him before a powerful leader called Ultravox arrives on the scene. Ultravox specializes in assassinations, but who is he targeting? As he dodges Elle&amp;#8217;s attacks, Alex is on a mission to uncover Ultravox&amp;#8217;s deadly plan before his friends and his school become collateral damage. There&amp;#8217;s no time to report back; innocent lives hang in the balance, and it&amp;#8217;s on Alex to act now&amp;#8212;or else.&lt;/p&gt;" />
