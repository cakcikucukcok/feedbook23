      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thelma and Louise&lt;/em&gt; gets remade in this powerful, darkly funny teen novel from acclaimed authors Brittany Cavallaro and Emily Henry. Two teenage girls who have had enough of the controlling men in their lives take their rage on the road to make a new life for themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winona has been starving for life in the seemingly perfect home that she shares with her seemingly perfect father, celebrity weatherman Stormy Olsen. No one knows that he locks the pantry door to control her eating and leaves bruises where no one can see them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lucille has been suffocating beneath the needs of her mother and her drug-dealing brother, wondering if there&amp;#8217;s more out there for her than disappearing waitress tips and a lifetime of barely getting by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One harrowing night, Winona and Lucille realize they can&amp;#8217;t wait until graduation to start their new lives. They need out. Now. One hour later, they&amp;#8217;re armed with a plan that will take them from their small Michigan town to Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All they need is three grand, fast.
