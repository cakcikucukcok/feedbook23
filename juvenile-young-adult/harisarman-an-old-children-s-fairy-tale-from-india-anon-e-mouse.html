      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 278&lt;br /&gt;
In this 278th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Indian children&amp;#39;s story of HARISARMAN.&lt;br /&gt;
In far, far away India where there was a Brahman in a village, named Harisarman. He was poor and foolish and in want of employment. He also had very many children.&lt;br /&gt;
He wandered about begging with his family, and at last he reached a certain city, and entered the service of a rich householder called Sthuladatta, which means frozen.&lt;br /&gt;
His sons became keepers of Sthuladatta&amp;#39;s cows and other property, and his wife a servant to him, and he himself lived near his house, performing the duty of an attendant, but, Harisarman wanted for more. So he devised a plan&amp;hellip;..&lt;br /&gt;
What was the plan Harisarman devised? Can a poor beggar really be expected to devise a plan that would result in him improving his outlook? And just what was the plan? Did it work or was Harisarman found out? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
