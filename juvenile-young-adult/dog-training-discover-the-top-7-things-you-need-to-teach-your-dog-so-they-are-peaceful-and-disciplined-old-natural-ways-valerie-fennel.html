  <title>Dog Training: Discover The Top 7 Things You Need To Teach Your Dog So They Are Peaceful And Disciplined - Old Natural Ways, Valerie Fennel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having pets is almost as American as apple pie and cheeseburgers. Dogs are thought to be man&#39;s best friend, and people take in these animals without a second thought a lot of the time. However, if you don&#39;t have previous experience with dogs or a sound understanding of their psychologies and perspectives, chances are your relationship with your dog, and the dog&#39;s life will suffer as a result. People love to take out their inability to understand their pets on their pets. They lack patience and understanding for these animals, who, without their approval, were taken from their place in the wild and domesticated for human use. Just because people believe that humans are at the top of the ladder, animals have come to be seen as beneath us and meant to serve people." />
