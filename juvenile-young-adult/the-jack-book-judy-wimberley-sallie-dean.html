  <title>The Jack Book - Judy Wimberley, Sallie Dean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Uncertainty can be a nagging fear for children even in the best of times (sunny days) but in troubling, difficult times ( stormy days), it can become a constant companion.  As parents and loved ones of children we would love to promise them--&quot;nothing bad is going to happen to you or me; everything is going to be all right.&quot;  Facing the reality that we are not in control of all that is part of our child&#39;s world and can not fulfill that promise in all situations,  how can we prepare them to live unfettered by fear.  Scripture gives us some great visuals to help us understand how Jesus loves and cares for us that can be grasped by even young children.  Six of them are covered here along with  suggestions for how to use the book to strengthen their grasp and understanding of these truths." />
