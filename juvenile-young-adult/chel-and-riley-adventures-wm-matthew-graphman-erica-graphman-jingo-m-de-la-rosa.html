  <title>Chel and Riley Adventures - Wm. Matthew Graphman, Erica Graphman, Jingo M. de la Rosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chel and Riley receive a strange phone call from a friend they havent heard from in a long, long time. Sagon has called from his uncles home a few blocks away. To their surprise, Chel and Riley realize that Sagons uncle owns the spooky Cunningham place that most of the kids in the area believe to be haunted. When Sagon calls, he sounds scared and is looking for the two friends to come over and help him spend the week at the uncles place until his mom can get back from a business trip. Chel and Riley are not sure about helping out their old friend, but Rileys mom reminds him that they need to be faithful friends and be there for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chel and Riley get more than they bargained for when they arrive. Not only is the house spooky on the outside, but a sudden thunderstorm forces the two to go inside immediately after they arrive. Much to their surprise, Sagon is nowhere to be found, and the two are trapped inside the spooky house. Chel and Riley must now test their faith as they search the spooky mansion for their buddy and try to find a way out. Will their faithfulness to their friend hold true, and can Chel and Riley figure out a way to escape the haunted house?&lt;/p&gt;" />
