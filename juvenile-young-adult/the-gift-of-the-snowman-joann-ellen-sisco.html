  <title>The Gift of the Snowman - Joann Ellen Sisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who would think a snowman would have something to give back? 
   Snows in Oklahoma can sometimes do things one wouldnt expect, and when a group of girls teamed up on a Christmas project, an unusual Christmas Snow occurred.  Just in time.
   Mr. Okie Snow was born in a day and he lived for almost a week, but during his lifetime he had a wonderful surprise for the girls that made him.  Sometimes the best surprises are those that are unexpected, and who would expect a surprise from a Snowman with green hair and orange lips wearing a glove and a mitten. And standing on two legs instead of a fat belly?  And, of course, he would be wearing shoes.   ." />
