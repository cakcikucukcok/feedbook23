      <meta name="description" content="Chiku the African Bird is a book about celebrating family.  In the modern world we are more frequently living away from our family of birth.  Even if we are living with or close to our biological family there may be separation, distance and misunderstandings.  This book is a celebration of humanity looking within ourselves to find the family support system we need to thrive.  On some occasions it may mean creating a new family of friends, neighbors or community members.  On other occasions it may mean looking at our family members from a new perspective, giving them and ourselves forgiveness and setting a new course where we can champion our similarities and common goals.  Families challenge with divorce, children who are grieving lost family members, children who are having a difficult time adjusting to a new marriage and new step parents, and all who feel the need to connect to a family support system can benefit from reading and experiencing Chiku the African Bird." />
