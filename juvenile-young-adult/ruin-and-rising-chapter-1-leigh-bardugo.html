  <title>Ruin and Rising: Chapter 1 - Leigh Bardugo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Download the first chapter of &lt;i&gt;Ruin and Rising&lt;/i&gt;, the highly anticipated conclusion to the Grisha Trilogy! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The capital has fallen. The Darkling rules Ravka from his shadow throne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the nation&#39;s fate rests with a broken Sun Summoner, a disgraced tracker, and the shattered remnants of a once-great magical army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep in an ancient network of tunnels and caverns, a weakened Alina must submit to the dubious protection of the Apparat and the zealots who worship her as a Saint. Yet her plans lie elsewhere, with the hunt for the elusive firebird and the hope that an outlaw prince still survives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alina will have to forge new alliances and put aside old rivalries as she and Mal race to find the last of Morozova&#39;s amplifiers. But as she begins to unravel the Darkling&#39;s secrets, she reveals a past that will forever alter her understanding of the bond they share and the power she wields. The firebird is the one thing that stands between Ravka and destruction--and claiming it could cost Alina the very future she&#39;s fighting for.&lt;/p&gt;" />
