  <title>Eddie and the Hot Cocoa Hot Rod - Valerie Williams-Sanchez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Eddie&#39;s a city kid whose obsession with cars and race car driving gets in the way of his studies, particularly his math studies. But, when a substitute teacher, who affectionately goes by the moniker &quot;Mr. Math,&quot; arrives with a similar love of hot cocoa and sports cars, young Eddie decides to give math one last try. In the end, Eddie learns the reward of his hard work, and that all teachers really aren&#39;t so bad.  Featuring  the newest in the Cocoa Kids Collection© cast of multicultural characters, including &quot;Auntie&quot; who we first met in Isaiah and the Chocolate Mountain©, and her son, &quot;Eddie,&quot;  this second work of fiction pulls readers deeper into the Cocoa Kids&#39; sweet, chocolate-sprinkled world.  With illustrations from returning artist Brooklyn Russell, the book includes a nod to current and historic Black race car drivers, like F1 racing phenom Lewis Hamilton (#44), and Wendell Scott, the first Black race car driver inducted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame." />
