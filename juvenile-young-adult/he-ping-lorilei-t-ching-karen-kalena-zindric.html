  <title>He Ping - Lorilei T. Ching, Karen Kalena Zindric</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Because baby He Pings parents are only allowed to have one child, when she is born, they place her in a basket and abandon her on a street in China, hoping that someone will adopt her. As He Ping embarks on a journey of hope, God begins to work His miracles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the ocean in a continent far away, the Holy Spirit stirs the heart of a family to pray about adoption. Meanwhile, a policeman takes He Ping to an orphanage, where a nice lady feeds her and cares for her. As Father God plans a future filled with hope and prosperity, He chooses the perfect family for her; she meets them in a grand hotel with shiny floors. But as two strangers hold out their arms and offer her a toy, He Ping feels scareduntil she hears God whisper in her ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by real-life experiences, He Ping shares the story of a Chinese orphan who discovers her fate and learns the truth about Gods eternal promises as despair gives way to abounding love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
