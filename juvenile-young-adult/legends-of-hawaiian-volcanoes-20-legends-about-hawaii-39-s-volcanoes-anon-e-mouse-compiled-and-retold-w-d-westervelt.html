      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 20 legends of Hawaii&amp;rsquo;s volcanoes and the demigods which occupy them. Many of these legends are about Pele who according to Polynesian myth lives in Kilauea.

On seeing Pele, Ai-laau was fearful and fled leaving the volcano to her, where until this day she digs and continues to release plumes of fire and rivers of lava.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find the legends of:&lt;br /&gt;
Ai-Laau, The Forest Eater&lt;br /&gt;
