      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A thrilling debut packed with action and mystery. Aliens never looked so good.&lt;/b&gt;&quot; -Jennifer L. Armentrout, #1 &lt;i&gt;NYT &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the future, only one rule will matter:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don&#39;t. Ever. Peek.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seventeen-year-old Ari Alexander just broke that rule and saw the last person she expected hovering above her bed -- arrogant Jackson Locke, the most popular boy in her school. She expects instant execution or some kind of freak alien punishment, but instead, Jackson issues a challenge: help him, or everyone on Earth will die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ari knows she should report him, but everything about Jackson makes her question what she&#39;s been taught about his kind. And against her instincts, she&#39;s falling for him. But Ari isn&#39;t just any girl, and Jackson wants more than her attention. She&#39;s a military legacy who&#39;s been trained by her father and exposed to war strategies and societal information no one can know -- especially an alien spy, like Jackson. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Giving Jackson the information he needs will betray her father and her country, but keeping silent will start a war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Taking series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Gravity&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Hover&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Collide&lt;/p&gt;" />
