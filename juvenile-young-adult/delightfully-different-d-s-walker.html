  <title>Delightfully Different - D. S. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are many facts within fiction. This captivating story provides invaluable insights into the childhood of a girl who has Aspergers syndrome. Fiction allows the author to explore different perspectives and add poignancy to the experiences of sensory sensitivity and being bullied and teased of someone who has Aspergers syndrome. The title &lt;i&gt;Delightfully Different&lt;/i&gt; describes Aspergers syndrome but also the qualities of this novel. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tony Attwood, world renowned psychologist and author of &lt;i&gt;The Complete Guide to Aspergers Syndrome&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Long, a successful Hawaiian pediatrician, and his wife Francesca have high hopes for their first child...born with Aspergers syndrome...Walker does a remarkable job illuminating Mias offbeat perspective from within; she makes it more a personality than an affliction...Walker dispels much of the mystery of Aspergers kids while revealing the richness and promise of their lives.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt; Kirkus Review&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the very beginning, Mia lives her life on earth knowing she is different, but not understanding why. With an extensive vocabulary and insight beyond her years, Mia is a beautiful spirit who soon develops extraordinary musical talents. But subtle signs soon emerge. Mia does not like to talk on the phone, walk barefoot on the grass, and cannot go to sleep without first lining up all her stuffed animals on her bed. Just as her family finally realizes that Mia is battling sensory sensitivity issues, she is bullied in fifth grade. After Mias school counselor causes her to feel like the guilty one, Mia struggles to forgive those who, through their own ignorance, have hurt her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Delightfully Different&lt;/i&gt; shares a poignant glimpse into the life and mind of a girl with Aspergers Syndrome who demonstrates through her compelling experiences that every life has a purpose and that being unique is what makes each of us special.&lt;/p&gt;" />
