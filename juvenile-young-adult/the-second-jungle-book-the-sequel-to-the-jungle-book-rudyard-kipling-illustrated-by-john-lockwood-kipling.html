  <title>THE SECOND JUNGLE BOOK - The sequel to The Jungle Book - Rudyard Kipling, Illustrated by John Lockwood Kipling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are a further 16 illustrated children&amp;rsquo;s stories and poems by English author Rudyard Kipling, set in the Seoni Jungle of Madhya Pradesh, India. This is the sequel to his equally famous &amp;ldquo;THE JUNGLE BOOK&amp;rdquo;, both are now considered to be classics of children&amp;rsquo;s literature. This volume features five stories about Mowgli plus three unrelated stories, all but one set in India.&lt;br /&gt;
Once again the supporting cast of characters are animals from The Jungle Book such as Akela the wolf, Shere Khan the tiger, Baloo the bear and Kaa the python are amongst the many which feature. All are just as captivating and alive with jungle tradition as they were in the first Jungle Book.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
How Fear Came,&lt;br /&gt;
The Law Of The Jungle,&lt;br /&gt;
The Miracle Of Purun Bhagat,&lt;br /&gt;
A Song Of Kabir,&lt;br /&gt;
Mowgli&amp;#39;s Song Against People,&lt;br /&gt;
A Ripple-Song, plus more.&lt;br /&gt;
The volume contains 34 illustrations by John Lockwood Kipling, father to Rudyard. These include decorative capitals, story headers and other illustrations.&lt;br /&gt;
The 1967 cartoon movie &amp;ldquo;The Jungle Book&amp;rdquo; by Disney, used both the First and Second Jungle Books as the story source.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;NOTE: This volume is NOT related to the 1997 film &amp;ldquo;The Second Jungle Book: Mowgli &amp;amp; Baloo&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net sale will be donated to charities by the publisher.&lt;br /&gt;
