      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paradise wasn&#39;t supposed to suck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not the state of being, but a resort in the Caribbean. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jena, Dakota, Skye, and Owen are all there for different reasons, but at Paradise their lives become tangled together in ways none of them can predict. Paradise will change them all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will change Jena, whose first brush with romance takes her that much closer to having a life, and not just reading about those infinitely cooler and more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will change Dakota, who needs the devastating truth about his past to make him realize that he doesn&#39;t have to be a jerk just because people think he&#39;s one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will change Skye, a heartbreakingly beautiful actress, who must come to terms with the fact that for once she has to stop playing a role or face the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And it will change Owen, who has never risked anything before and who will take the leap from his online life to a real one all because of a girl he met at Paradise. . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From confused to confident and back again, one thing&#39;s certain: Four months after it all begins, none of them will ever be the same.&lt;/p&gt;" />
