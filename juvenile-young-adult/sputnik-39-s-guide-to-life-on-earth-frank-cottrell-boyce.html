That&#39;s important when you have a grandfather who is constantly forgetting. And it&#39;s even more important when your grandfather can&#39;t care for you anymore and you have to go live with a foster family out in the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prez is still learning to fit in at his new home when he answers the door to meet Sputnik&amp;#8212;a kid who is more than a little strange. First, he can hear what Prez is thinking. Second, he looks like a dog to everyone except Prez. Third, he can manipulate the laws of space and time. Sputnik, it turns out is an alien, and he&#39;s got a mission that requires Prez&#39;s help: the Earth has been marked for destruction, and the only way they can stop it is to&amp;#160;come up with ten reasons why the&amp;#160;planet should be saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus begins one of the most fun and eventful summers of Prez&#39;s life, as he and Sputnik set out on a journey to compile the most important list Prez has ever made&amp;#8212;and discover just what makes&amp;#160;our world so remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
