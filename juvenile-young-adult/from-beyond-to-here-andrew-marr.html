  <title>From Beyond to Here - Andrew Marr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Beyond our wildest imaginations, other worlds and dimensions exist that are vastly different than ours. These worlds beyond both fascinate and frighten us, but more importantly, they have the potential to bring a great good we never could have envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this intriguing collection of stories that explores the ramifications of encounters with beings from the beyond, the appearance of a bewildering and elusive visitor to an eleven-year-old resident brings an unusual gift that turns his entire town inside out. Two young siblingswhose parents have just left them for a year with their callous aunt and unclesoon discover they have an angry ghost to contend with as well. As a family moves into a strange house, they find the house a lot stranger than they bargained for. When a boy finds his school filled with the ghosts of fellow students and teachers, he is mystified when he sees these same people still alive in the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Beyond to Here&lt;/i&gt; is a compilation of stories for young fans of the supernatural sure to entertain and raise questions about intriguing parallel worlds. &lt;/p&gt;" />
