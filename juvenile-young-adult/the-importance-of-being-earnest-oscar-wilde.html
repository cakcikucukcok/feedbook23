  <title>The Importance of Being Earnest -  Oscar Wilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Importance of Being Earnest, A Trivial Comedy for Serious People is a play by Oscar Wilde.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First performed on 14 February 1895 at St. James&amp;#39;s Theatre in London, it is a farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personae in order to escape burdensome social obligations. Contemporary reviews all praised the play&amp;#39;s humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others foresaw the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde&amp;#39;s artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde&amp;#39;s most enduringly popular play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oscar Wilde (1854&amp;ndash;1900) was an Irish writer and poet. Today he is remembered for his epigrams and plays, and the circumstances of his imprisonment which was followed by his early death." />
