  <title>Katie the Christian Caterpillar - Susan A. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Stamey, a young boy, and Katie the Christian Caterpillar, who lives in the old oak tree outside of Davids window, are very good friends. As a Christian, Katie has helped David learn a lot about life, Gods love, and a place called heaven. Today, however, David has a very serious problem. His grandfather has died, and David doesnt really understand what that means. Its up to his good friend, Katie, to help him understand Gods promise for death and what that means for his grandfather. 
Katie has also experienced the death of loved ones. She, too, lost her grandfather and knows what its like to miss someone important to you. Katie shares the story of how her grandparents built their cocoons, turned into butterflies, and flew away to heaven. But will that be enough to give David the peace he needs to accept his grandfathers passing? 
Join David, Katie, and all of their oak tree friends as they work together to learn another lesson about the power of Gods love." />
