  <title>Push Girl - Chelsie Hill, Jessica Patrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An inspiring, real, and fresh young adult novel about how life can change in an instant by Chelsie Hill, one of the stars Sundance Channel&#39;s series &quot;Push Girls.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kara is a high school junior who&#39;s loving life. She&#39;s popular, has a great group of friends and an amazing boyfriend, and she&#39;s a shoe-in for homecoming queen. Even though her parents can&#39;t stop fighting and her ex-boyfriend can&#39;t seem to leave her alone, Kara won&#39;t let anything get in the way of her perfect year. It&#39;s Friday night, and Kara arrives at a party, upset after hearing her parents having another one of their awful fights, and sees another girl with her hands all over her boyfriend. Furious, Kara leaves to take a drive, and, as she&#39;s crossing an intersection, a car comes out of nowhere and slams into the driver&#39;s side of Kara&#39;s car. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Kara wakes up, she has no memory of the night before. Where is she? Why are her parents crying? And, most importantly -- why can&#39;t she feel her legs? As Kara is forced to adjust to her new life as a paralyzed teen, where her friends aren&#39;t who they seemed to be and her once-adoring boyfriend is mysteriously absent, she starts to realize that what matters in life isn&#39;t what happens to you -- it&#39;s the choices you make and the people you love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Co-written by &quot;Push Girls&quot; star Chelsie Hill, whose real life inspired Kara&#39;s experience, this uplifting novel takes young readers from tragedy to triumph with an unforgettable and unique heroine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
