  <title>Muggie Maggie - Beverly Cleary, Tracy Dockray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this humorous and relatable novel from Newbery Medal-winning author Beverly Cleary, a girl must overcome her rebellious attitude toward learning cursive. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, Maggie is just feeling stubborn when she declares she won&#39;t learn cursive. What&#39;s wrong with print, anyway? And she can easily type on a computer, so why would she need to know how to read those squiggly lines? But soon all her classmates are buzzing about Maggie&#39;s decision, especially after her teacher, Mrs. Leeper, says Maggie&#39;s cursive is so sloppy that her name looks like &quot;Muggie.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &quot;Muggie Maggie&quot; ringing in her ears, Maggie absolutely, positively won&#39;t back down...until she&#39;s appointed class mail messenger. All the letters that Mrs. Leeper sends to the office are in cursive, and Maggie thinks they are written about her. But there&#39;s only way to know for sure...so what&#39;s Maggie going to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For generations, Beverly Cleary has captivated readers of all ages with beloved characters such as Ramona Quimby, Henry Huggins, Ribsy, and Ralph S. Mouse. &lt;em&gt;Muggie Maggie&lt;/em&gt; follows suit with what &lt;em&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/em&gt; calls &quot;a likable, funny heroine whom readers will want to know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
