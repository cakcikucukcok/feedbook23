  <title>Fading Tracks - Kristi Holl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lonely and a long way from her Iowa home, twelve-year-old Jeri McKane reacts to boarding school the way most middle schoolers would. Even with close friends, she wonders whether her scholarship to prestigious Landmark School was worth it. She’s tempted to give up when her Mom can’t make parents’ weekend, and the school bus carrying her roommate, Rosa, disappears. But this reporter for the sixth-grade newspaper has an eye like Nancy Drew and more faith and courage than she realizes. Jeri solves the mystery—and makes landmark decisions to trust God and his Word through circumstances and feelings that don’t make sense." />
