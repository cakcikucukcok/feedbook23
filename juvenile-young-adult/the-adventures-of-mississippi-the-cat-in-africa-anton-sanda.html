  <title>The Adventures of Mississippi the Cat in Africa - Anton Sanda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The idea of this book was inspired by Selma Lagerlf, Nobel prize winner 1909. Being a school teacher, she wanted to write a manual of geography and the result was
The Wonderful Adventures of Nils Holgersson,
A book loved by children all over the world. In Mississippi I tried to offer/provide/present some notions of zoology, geography, even history and mythology, with the intention to arouse childrens interest and make them open a lexicon.
The main characters of this book are not imaginary.
Mississippi, the cat, existed for real. He was very intelligent.
Brunhilda, the witch, was some time in the past, long before she indulged in sorcery and witchcraft, a young and beautiful girl, but even then she had some magic about her.
If you will go to Africa, you will meet the crocodile, the camel, the vulture and the lion.
But most real are the two children. Their names are Amanda and Daniel" />
