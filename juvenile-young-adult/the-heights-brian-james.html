  <title>The Heights - Brian James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Henry liked to imagine his life began that cold rainy day in San Francisco when Mr. Earnshaw found him shivering by the side of the road. That was the day Henry met Catherine. For Henry, Catherine is like a precious gift. She pushes away his angry thoughts and makes him feel safe and calm. And though Mr. Earnshaw, a widow, raises the orphan and Catherine as brother and sister, their love for each other goes much deeper. They vow to always be together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But everything changes when Mr. Earnshaw dies suddenly and Hindley, Mr. Earnshaw&#39;s own son, gains control of the family finances. Furiously jealous, Hindley never accepted Henry as a true member of the family. He works to sever Henry&#39;s relationship with Catherine and the violent rage Henry has harbored since he was a child bubbles to the surface. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contemporizing the classic novel, &lt;i&gt;Wuthering&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Heights&lt;/i&gt;, notable YA author, Brian James delives into the dark nature of obsessive love, the social injustices of class, and the self-destructive power of revenge in this emotionally raw unforgettable offering.&lt;/p&gt;" />
