  <title>RUSSIAN FAIRY TALES FROM THE SKAZKI OF POLEVOI - 24 Russian Fairy Tales - Anon E. Mouse, Translated By R. Nisbet Bain, Compiled and Retold by R. Nisbet Bain, Illustrated by C. M. Gere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The existence of the Russian Skazki or M&amp;auml;rchen (Stories, Folklore or Fairy Tales) was first made generally known to the British Public in about 1880 by William Ralston in his Russian Folk Tales. A year after the appearance of Ralston&amp;#39;s book, the eminent Russian historian and arch&amp;aelig;ologist, Peter Nikolaevich Polevoi selected, from the inexhaustible stores of Afanasiev, some three dozen of the Skazki (stories) most suitable for children, and worked them up into a fairy tale book which was published at St. Petersburg in 1874, under the title of Narodnuiya Russkiya Skazki (Popular Russian Stories).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To manipulate these quaintly vigorous old world stories for nursery purposes was, no easy task, but, on the whole, M. Polevoi did his work excellently well, softening the crudities and smoothing out the occasional roughness, turning these charming stories into entirely readable stories for children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is from the first Russian edition of M. Polevoi&amp;#39;s book that the following selection of 24 Russian stories has been made. With the single exception of &amp;quot;Morozko,&amp;quot; a variant of which may be familiar to those who know Mr. Ralston&amp;#39;s volume. Some of the stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Golden Mountain&lt;br /&gt;
Morozko&lt;br /&gt;
The Flying Ship&lt;br /&gt;
The Story of the Tsarevich Ivan, and of The Harp that Harped Without A Harper&lt;br /&gt;
The Story of Gore-Gorinskoe&lt;br /&gt;
Go I Know Not Whither&amp;mdash;Fetch I Know Not What&lt;br /&gt;
Kuz&amp;rsquo;ma Skorobogaty&lt;br /&gt;
The Tsarevna Loveliness-Inexhaustible&lt;br /&gt;
Verlioka; and many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
