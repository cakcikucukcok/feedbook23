  <title>THE SECOND BOOK OF DRAGONS - 28 tales of dragons - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by John Halsted</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following Edith Nesbit&amp;rsquo;s successful book &amp;ldquo;The Book of Dragon&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo;, it was unfortunate she didn&amp;rsquo;t follow this up with a sequel. But look no further! John Halsted, author, publisher and folklorist has compiled &amp;ldquo;The Second Book of Dragons&amp;rdquo; using the many books in the Abela catalogue as his source.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book you will find 28 illustrated tales of dragons and serpents drawn from the mists of time. Some are friendly dragons which provide wisdom and direction to the heroes of our stories. Others are downright wicked, oozing malice and evil, leaving the hero of the story no option but to engage the spiteful, fire-breathing, beast in battle. Our heroes always sally forth wilfully, but cautiously, engaging these ancient creatures to save a damsel in distress, or to save families, from what seems to be sure destruction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find stories like &amp;quot;The Deluded Dragon&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Gypsy And The Dragon&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Two Princes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Dragon Of Ghent&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Magic Egg&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Great Battle&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Sword Gram And The Dragon Fafnir&amp;quot; and many, many more. These tales have been drawn from eighteen old and forgotten books and the thirty-three illustrations are by different artists bringing styles that are as different as the stories themselves." />
