  <title>The Adventures of Karma Cat - Tara Olivia, Carol Abel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Karma Cat is always there when you need him! Throughout this story, Karma Cat appears any time children find themselves in a situation where they feel powerless. This book journeys through seven different relatable scenarios. During each scenario, Karma Cat magically appears just in time. Karma Cat knows just how to deliver energy to each child by using the seven chakras. Our chakras are energy centers in the body that, when spinning and open, we feel powerful and balanced. When they are stuck like mud, we have trouble acting and deciding. With the help of Karma Cat and his magic, this book teaches children and parents how to use energy to calmly solve any situation we encounter. 
The stories focus on social issues such as relationships, bullying, self confidence, and danger. It explores dealing with emotions and what to do with those emotions. After reading this book, you may find that you and your child have discovered how to use one of the best kept secrets, which is the utilization of chakra energy. The development of presence, emotional control, and the ability to generate your own inner strength are results to expect after sharing this book with your child. The story begins when Siena is separated from her mommy in a busy store. She feels lost, powerless, and scared. Karma Cat arrives and helps her feel brave enough to call out and find her mommy. The stories continue on with a new student being teased, a difficult playground situation of bullying, sports and perseverance when trying out for a team, stranger danger, and even a little girls best friend moving away, leaving her alone. Enjoy these stories while discussing experiences your child may be having. Karma cat is always there waiting to help you and your child." />
