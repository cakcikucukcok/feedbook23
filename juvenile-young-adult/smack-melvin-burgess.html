  <title>Smack - Melvin Burgess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winner of the 1996 Carnegie Medal in Literature and the Guardian Prize for fiction, two of England&#39;s most prestigious awards, Smack tells a penetrating story about heroin use, a topic that is becoming familiar in the news and one of importance to teens everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story begins with Tar, a fourteen-year-old, who runs away from home. He convinces his girlfriend, Gemma, to come with him, and it is not long before they are engulfed in a loose community of people living in abandoned buildings. Everything seems to be turning out so well: they have a roof over their heads, food to eat, and a brand-new group of friends. And when Tar and Gemma try their first hit of smack, they think life will keep on getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before long, they find they&#39;ve lost control. The search for the next hit becomes all-consuming--until a disaster forces Gemma to take matters into her own hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insightful, haunting, and real, &lt;i&gt;Smack &lt;/i&gt;is the Go Ask Alice of the &#39;90s. It&#39;s a book that every teenager should read--then pass along to a friend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
