  <title>Twelve Upon A Time... December: The Magical Cane to Christmas&#39; Journey, Bedside Story Collection Series - Edward Galluzzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the twelfth and final book in a 12 book &lt;i&gt;Bedside Story Collection Series&lt;/i&gt; spanning across the 12 months of the year.  Each of the 12 bedside stories is reprinted in color from the author&#39;s black and white third edition book &lt;i&gt;Twelve Upon A Time&lt;/i&gt;.  Each monthly story is unique and illustrated by the original drawings of children whose interpretation of the words can only be seen through their eyes. &lt;br&gt;This December bedside story is entitled &lt;i&gt;The Magical Cane to Christmas&#39; Journey&lt;/i&gt;.  It celebrates the warmth of the holiday season with a family whose children share the Christmas&#39; past of their parents through the magic and wonder of a special candy cane. &lt;br&gt;This December bedside story and all the stories are written to further the imagination of children and to strengthen the parent and child bond through the sharing of heartwarming, silly, absurd and believably impossible tales. &lt;br&gt;This December bedside story is the final story in the &lt;i&gt;Bedside Story Collection Series&lt;/i&gt;.  The author and publisher hope that you have enjoyed all 12 books in the series, not &lt;i&gt;Once upon a time&lt;/i&gt;, but &lt;i&gt;Twelve upon a time...&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;As a doctorate level practitioner serving school children for more than 35 years, Edward Galluzzi became keenly aware that children and their parents often had in short supply what families needed the most:  open communication and sharing time together.  The &lt;i&gt;Bedside Story Collection Series&lt;/i&gt; was written to provide families a moment here and a moment there to come together and share heart warming, silly and believably unbelievable tales.   &lt;br&gt;The stories are tied typically to the main holiday or theme of each month, more or less.  The characters in the stories are based on what children relate to the most... animals and other children.  There are also over 100 colored drawings sketched by children ranging from 7 months to 12 years of age.  The stories from Mr. Galluzzi&#39;s imagination and the drawings from theirs come together to stimulate the imaginations of children and open a whole new world for parents and their children to share.   &lt;br&gt;That is his gift to your family.  Time for sharing... time for laughing... time for talking... time for each other.  Not once upon a time, but Twelve Upon A Time...." />
