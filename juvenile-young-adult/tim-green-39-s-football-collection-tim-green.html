  <title>Tim Green&#39;s Football Collection - Tim Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author and former NFL defensive end Tim Green&amp;#39;s football stories are packed with sports action and emotional heart that will keep kids on the edge of their seats. This collection contains four bestselling novels in the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Big Time&lt;/em&gt;: Things couldn&amp;#39;t be going better for Troy White. The Atlanta Falcons&amp;#39; football genius is at the top of his game, helping the team get to the playoffs. Agents and lawyers are knocking on his door with big-money offers for the upcoming season. And his own football team has just won the Georgia State Championship! Troy&amp;#39;s celebrating with his friends at linebacker Seth Halloway&amp;#39;s mansion when another lawyer comes knocking&amp;#8212;and he says, &amp;#34;I think I&amp;#39;m your father.&amp;#34; In that instant, Troy&amp;#39;s life is changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deep Zone&lt;/em&gt;: From the moment two football champs cross paths, Troy White and Ty Lewis begin to size each other up. But when the two rivals find themselves somehow tangled in the same dangerous web of deceit, they discover that they have more in common than their skill at football. Uniting Troy, first seen in the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling &lt;em&gt;Football Genius&lt;/em&gt;, and Ty, who was chased by the Mafia in &lt;em&gt;Football Hero&lt;/em&gt;, this fourth book in the Football Genius series delivers high-stakes action on and off the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect Season&lt;/em&gt;: Troy&amp;#39;s dreams of the big time have backfired. Sure, he&amp;#39;s moved to New Jersey to start his new job as &amp;#34;genius&amp;#34; for the New York Jets, but his dad has taken his entire salary, leaving Troy and his mom broke. Now Troy has no hope of going to private school and playing for a football powerhouse with his cousin Ty. But when he gets Seth to coach his public school team, Troy feels ready for a perfect season. He doesn&amp;#39;t guess that he&amp;#39;ll be struggling against those who want him to lose. When Troy&amp;#39;s talent for calling plays slips and his abilities as a quarterback are threatened, he&amp;#39;s got to dig deep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/em&gt;: If anyone understands the phrase &amp;#34;tough luck,&amp;#34; it&amp;#39;s Harrison. As a foster kid in a cruel home, he knows his dream of one day playing in the NFL is a longshot. Then Harrison is brought into a new home with kind, loving parents&amp;#8212;his new dad is even a football coach. But Harrison&amp;#39;s good luck can&amp;#39;t last forever. When a routine sports injury leads to a devastating diagnosis, it will take every ounce of Harrison&amp;#39;s determination not to give up for good. Inspired by interviews with real-life cancer survivors and insider sports experience, this unforgettable &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller shows a brave boy who learns what it truly means to be unstoppable. As National Ambassador for Young People&amp;#39;s Literature emeritus Jon Scieszka said, &lt;em&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/em&gt; is &amp;#34;absolutely heroic, and something every guy should read.&amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;" />
