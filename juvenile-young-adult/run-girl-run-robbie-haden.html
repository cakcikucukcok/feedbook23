  <title>Run Girl Run - Robbie Haden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unhappy at home, teen Haley-Jo Bodine decides the time has come to hit the road for California, leaving Texas behind. She fully expects to find a way to make it big in Hollywood. Her dream is to begin with modeling and then work her way into acting. Soon enough, painful reality sets in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Haley-Jos runaway life takes her into the world of drugs, drinking, sexual abuse, cutting, suicide, rape, and prostitution. These difficult subjects are treated with the sensitivity necessary to remain appropriate for a teen audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even in its worst moments, Haley-Jos story remains hopeful as she encounters a series of people who come into her life when she needs them most to help her find her way out of deep trouble. Pauletta, the owner of a pet sanctuary, takes Haley-Jo under her wing as though she were a foundling pup. Spencer is not a boyfriend but is a true friend who is a boy. Ray is the first person to offer her the Pacific Ocean and a temporary place to crash. Above all it is Tom who, aided by his dog Sally, is her gentle savior in the end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a cautionary tale for kids at risk. For the adults who love them, it is an enlightening glimpse into how some teens think. Beyond all that, it is just a good story." />
