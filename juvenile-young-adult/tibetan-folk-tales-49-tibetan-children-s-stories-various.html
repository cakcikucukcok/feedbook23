  <title>TIBETAN FOLK TALES - 49 Tibetan children’s stories - Various</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every country has its folk-lore tales that have always been a joy and pleasure to the children, not only of their own land, but of other lands as well. The 49 children&amp;rsquo;s stories in this book were told as the Tibetan folk sat around their boiling tea made over a three stone camp-fire. They have been handed down from father to son and from mother to daughter. Though often filled with their superstitious beliefs, through them all run a vein of humor and the teachings of a moral truths which is quite unexpected.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Herein are stories like: &amp;ldquo;The Wise Bat&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Tiger and the Frog&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Cony Who Got into Bad Company&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Story of the Donkey and the Rock&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Story of the Foolish Head-Man&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;How the Fox Fell a Victim to His Own Deceit&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;The Ingratitude of Man&amp;rdquo; and many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
These tales were gathered by Dr. A. L. Shelton on his trips among the Tibetans. He collected them as he joined Tibetan families around their camp-fires at night, and in their black tents high up in the Kunlun, Karakorum and Himalayan mountain ranges.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
May these stories add a little to this pleasure and enjoyment everywhere, in whatsoever tongue they may be translated or in whatever land they may be read.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
33% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to the Tibetan Centre in London for the support of Tibetan people in the UK." />
