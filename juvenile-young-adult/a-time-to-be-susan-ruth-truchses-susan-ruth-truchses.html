  <title>A Time to Be - Susan Ruth Truchses, Susan Ruth Truchses</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Children frequently deal with issues of inferiority, especially when they compare themselves to their friends and classmates. Most of the time, children are reluctant to tell anyone how they feel. By keeping their feelings to themselves, the issues cannot be resolved in appropriate ways. 
A Time To Be, is the story of a caterpillars metamorphosis into a butterfly. Through this simple story, children may begin to understand that in time circumstances change. They too will change. Presently, they have no idea what the future holds in store for them. What they can do however, is determine what they really enjoy doing and with help find ways to make that happen. Hiding or keeping silent, is not the way to solve such problems. 
When children find what brings joy to their life, there is less need for acceptance by others. By doing what they do enjoy, perhaps friendships with others with similar interests may be established." />
