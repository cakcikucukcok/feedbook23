  <title>House of Dark Shadows - Robert Liparulo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;Dream house . . . or bad dream?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When the Kings move from L.A. to a secluded small town, fifteen-year-old Xander is beyond disappointed. He and his friends loved to create amateur films . . . but the tiny town of Pinedale is the last place a movie buff and future filmmaker wants to land.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But he, David, and Toria are captivated by the many rooms in the old Victorian fixer-upper they moved into--as well as the heavy woods surrounding the house. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They soon discover there&#39;s something odd about the house. Sounds come from the wrong directions. Prints of giant, bare feet appear in the dust. And when David tries to hide in the linen closet, he winds up in locker 119 at his new school.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then the &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;really&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; weird stuff kicks in: they find a hidden hallway with portals leading off to far-off places--in long-ago times. Xander is starting to wonder if this kind of travel is a teen&#39;s dream come true . . . or his worst nightmare.&lt;BR&gt;" />
