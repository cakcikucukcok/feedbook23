  <title>Madlenka&#39;s Dog - Peter Sís, Peter Sís</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Note to Readers: Double-tap on images with golden borders to see more!&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another delightful romp around Madlenka&#39;s city block&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madlenka wants a dog! She doesn&#39;t really care what kind, so long as it&#39;s a dog that she can put on a leash and walk around the block. But her mother and father say NO! What is Madlenka to do? It just takes some imagination . . . Madlenka&#39;s friends on the block all play along, remembering the dogs of their childhood, and in the end it seems quite possible that there&#39;s more to Madlenka&#39;s dog than we can see. With his considerable charm, Peter Sís uses lift-up flaps and peek-through windows to bring us into Madlenka&#39;s magical world where play and fantasy make wishes come true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Madlenka&#39;s Dog&lt;/i&gt; is a 2002 New York Times Book Review Notable Children&#39;s Book of the Year and a 2003 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.
