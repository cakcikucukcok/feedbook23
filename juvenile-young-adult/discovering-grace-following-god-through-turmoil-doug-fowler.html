  <title>Discovering Grace: Following God Through Turmoil - Doug Fowler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Family problems thrust young Grace and Jimmy into helping with tons of issues after they find answers to life&#39;s questions. Their mom&#39;s repeat boyfriend wasn&#39;t faithful at first. His kids have loads of bitterness from his divorce. Grace has her own mixed feelings about him. She and Jimmy survive and try learn to love family members - all with issues of their own - as Jesus would. These members include a mom who would rather think about guys at times, a young sibling who tests Grace to see if there is unconditional love there, and Jessica, an older teen who stirs things up for her own reasons. Is it to taunt Grace or is she hiding something? Also, what&#39;s waiting on their vacation to cause even more turmoil? Readers of all ages will see how God brings good from the most imperfect situations when we trust Him. Grace and Jimmy learn some things take years of prayer, but God gives victories, too, as they explore the wonderful adventure that is the Christian life, and discover the riches of God&#39;s great grace." />
