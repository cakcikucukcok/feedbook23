  <title>Otuna&#39;s Flute - Maricar Banguis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The holidays are quickly approaching, which, for nine-year-old Jimmy, means a whole summer of making friends, discovering secrets, and, best of all, going on extraordinary adventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or so he thinks&amp;mdash;but when his parents get called away on a business trip to New York, Jimmy finds himself facing the summer alone at his grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house. &lt;em&gt;Great&lt;/em&gt;&amp;mdash;while his friends travel the world, he&amp;rsquo;ll lie around, bored to tears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his grandmother&amp;rsquo;s house is not all it seems, and adventure might not be so far away after all. Lured by a mysterious song to the attic, Jimmy finds among the old boxes a mysterious glass flute. When he raises it to his lips and gently blows, Boston is left behind&amp;mdash;and Jimmy finds himself facing the drawn bow of a startled huntsman in a forest he&amp;rsquo;s never seen before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he explores this faraway land and tries to find his way home, Jimmy will meet strange creatures, new friends, and cunning foes. Rumor has it that the king, hidden away in the city of Verunia, has been searching for a favored relic of his lost wife: an old glass flute with magical properties&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;" />
