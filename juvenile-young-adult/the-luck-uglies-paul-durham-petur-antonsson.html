  <title>The Luck Uglies - Paul Durham, Petur Antonsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first in a series with the makings of a modern classic, &lt;em&gt;The Luck Uglies&lt;/em&gt; is an irresistible cross between&amp;#160;Chris Colfer&#39;s Land of Stories series and Kelly Barnhill&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Girl Who Drank the Moon&lt;/em&gt;, overflowing with adventure, secrets, friendship, and magic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rye O&#39;Chanter has seen a lot of strange things happen in Village Drowning: Children are chased through the streets. Families are fined for breaking laws that don&#39;t even exist. Girls aren&#39;t allowed to read anymore, and certain books&amp;#8212;books that hold secrets about Drowning&#39;s past&amp;#8212;have been outlawed altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now a terrifying encounter has eleven-year-old Rye convinced that the monstrous, supposedly extinct Bog Noblins have returned. Before the monsters disappeared, there was only one way to defeat them&amp;#8212;the Luck Uglies. But the Luck Uglies have long since been exiled, and there&#39;s nobody left who can protect the village.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Rye dives into Drowning&#39;s maze of secrets, rules, and lies, she begins to question everything she&#39;s been told about the village&#39;s legend of outlaws and beasts . . . and what she&#39;ll discover is that it may take a villain to save them from the monsters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This critically acclaimed debut middle grade novel was named an ALA Notable Book and a New York Public Library Title for Reading and Sharing and won the Cybil Award for Middle Grade Speculative Fiction and a Sunshine State Young Readers Award.&lt;/p&gt;" />
