  <title>Elephi - Jean Stafford, Erik Blegvad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A lighthearted concoction of extraordinary events, told with affection and humor.&quot; &amp;#8213; &lt;I&gt;The New York Times.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Oh, what an admirable cat is Elephi! (And what an admirable writer is Jean Stafford!) &amp;#8230; Don&#39;t you miss knowing Elephi. (Or Erik Blegvad&#39;s apt illustrations.)&quot; &amp;#8213; &lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;Elephi Pelephi Well Known Cat Formerly Kitten lives a comfortable life with a kind but dull couple who often leave him to his own devices. Being a cat with a high IQ, he longs for stimulating companionship, and when he spies a snow-covered car outside his Fifth Avenue apartment, Elephi recognizes the opportunity for an adventure. Taking advantage of an open door, the intrepid cat bolts out to the street and devises a rescue for the abandoned vehicle, a daring maneuver that leads to comic confusion and a surprising new friendship. &lt;BR&gt;Splendid black-and-white drawings that evoke New York City of the 1960s complement this classic by the winner of the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Jean Stafford is best known for her short stories, which appeared in the &lt;I&gt;New Yorker&lt;/I&gt; and other literary magazines. Her own beloved pet inspired this tale of Elephi, Stafford&#39;s only children&#39;s book, which is clearly the work of someone who loves and understands cats." />
