  <title>DAME PRIDGETT AND THE FAIRIES - An English Fairy Tale - Anon E Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 93&lt;br /&gt;
In Issue 93 of the Baba Indaba Children&amp;#39;s Stories, Baba Indaba narrates the English Fairy Tale of Dame Pridgett who is a fat, comfortable, good-natured old body, whose business in life was to go about nursing sick folk and making them well again.&lt;br /&gt;
One day she was sitting by her window, rocking herself and resting after a hard week of nursing and there she saw a queer-looking little man come riding along the road on a great fiery, prancing black horse. He rode up to her door and knocked without getting off his horse, and when Dame Pridgett opened the door he looked down at her with such queer pale eyes he almost frightened her.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Are you Dame Pridgett?&amp;rdquo; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I am,&amp;rdquo; answered the dame.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And do you go about nursing sick people?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, that is my business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Then you are the one I want. My wife is ill, and I am seeking someone to nurse her.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
And that was just the beginning of the story. Download and read this story to find out what happened to Dame Pridgett next.&lt;br /&gt;
