  <title>The Worm Whisperer - Betty Hicks, Ben Hatke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve heard of Horse Whisperers and Dog Whisperers, but Ellis thinks he might be a Worm Whisperer! &lt;br&gt;Ellis Coffey loves animals. He spends so much time outdoors that sometimes he thinks he can talk with them. When he discovers a caterpillar that seems to follow his directions, he knows he has a chance to win the annual Woolly Worm race. The prize money is $1,000--exactly the amount of the deductible for his dad&#39;s back surgery. If Ellis is right and he can train his woolly worm to be the fastest in the county, he&#39;s sure can solve all his family&#39;s problems. But when you&#39;re trying to talk to insects, nothing is as simple as it seems. &lt;br&gt;From Betty Hicks, author of the Gym Shorts series for new readers, comes a story of friendship, family, and hidden talents that might be more useful than they first seemed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
