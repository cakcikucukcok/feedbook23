  <title>RÜBEZAHL - A Polish Fairy Tale narrated by Baba Indaba - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 412&lt;br /&gt;
In this 412th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Polish Fairy Tale &amp;quot;R&amp;Uuml;BEZAHL&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
R&amp;uuml;bezahl is a folklore mountain spirit of the Karkonosze, or Giant, &amp;nbsp;Mountains which run along the border between the historical lands of Bohemia (Czech Republic) and Silesia (Poland).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In legend, R&amp;uuml;bezahl appears as a giant, a gnome, or mountain spirit. With good people he is friendly, teaching them medicine and giving them presents. However, if someone derides him he exacts a severe revenge. He sometimes plays the role of a trickster in folk tales.&lt;br /&gt;
Our story starts with R&amp;uuml;bezahl tending a flock of sheet in a sweet mountain glade. He spies and falls in love with a fair maiden, a daughter of the King. He plans to win her love by enchanting a nearby grotto by turning rocks into white marble, daisies into climbing roses, rocks into crystals and berries into strange and exotic fruits. Even sparrows are transformed into exotic colourful creatures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On arriving the princess and her companions are amazed by their discovery. After tasting the fruits and exploring this magical mini-wonderland, the princess cries out that nothing would content her but to bathe in the marble pool. This she did&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
But what happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well, to find the answer to this question, and any others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
