  <title>Pretty Face - Mary Hogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s what I am. A funny girl. A &lt;em&gt;friend&lt;/em&gt;. Nobody&#39;s girlfriend. The girl with the pretty &lt;em&gt;face&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hayley wishes she could love living in Santa Monica, blocks from the beach, where every day&amp;#8212;and everybody&amp;#8212;is beautiful and sunny. But she just doesn&#39;t fit in with all the blond, superskinny Southern California girls who have their plastic surgeons on speed dial. Hayley is smart and witty and has such a pretty . . . face. Translation: Don&#39;t even &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; about putting on a bikini, much less dating superhot Drew Wyler. A bikini will never be flattering, and Drew will never think of her as more than a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when Hayley feels doomed to live her life in the &lt;em&gt;fat&lt;/em&gt; lane, her parents decide to send her to Italy for the summer&amp;#8212;not for school, not for fat camp, just for fun. It&#39;s there, under the Italian sun, that Hayley&#39;s vision of herself starts to change. She&#39;s curvy, not fat. Pizza isn&#39;t evil. And life is so much more than one-size-fits-all. Who knows? Once Hayley sees herself in a new light, maybe the girl with the pretty face will finally find true &lt;em&gt;amore&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;" />
