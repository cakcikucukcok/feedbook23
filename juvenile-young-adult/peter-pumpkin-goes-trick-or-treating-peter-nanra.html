  <title>Peter Pumpkin Goes Trick-Or-Treating - Peter Nanra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Halloween is a special and exciting time for pumpkins. They play games, light fireworks, and eat lots of candy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing beats trick-or-treating, and Peter Pumpkin is finally getting his chance to leave the pumpkin patch and join the other pumpkins for the festivities.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;He gets a surprise when his sister, Petrina, tells him that instead of trick-or-treating with the communal group, hell be joining her and her friends on the adventure of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, they must get prepared, and a primary order of business is deciding what theyll wear on their journey. They also need to be safe, because if they meet a witch, ghost or ghoul, they could be turned into pumpkin pies or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pumpkins also know that Wanda--the evil ghoul--might invade the pumpkin patch if she figures out where the pumpkins keep their candy. In fact, if she had her way, shed exterminate all the pumpkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the pumpkins as they enjoy a rite of passage and navigate an exciting but dangerous Halloween tradition that dates back hundreds and hundreds of years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
