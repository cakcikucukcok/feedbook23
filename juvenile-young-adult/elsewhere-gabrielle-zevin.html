  <title>Elsewhere - Gabrielle Zevin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it possible to grow up while getting younger?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Elsewhere. It is warm, with a breeze, and the beaches are marvelous. It&#39;s quiet and peaceful. You can&#39;t get sick or any older. Curious to see new paintings by Picasso? Swing by one of Elsewhere&#39;s museums. Need to talk to someone about your problems? Stop by Marilyn Monroe&#39;s psychiatric practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere is where fifteen-year-old Liz Hall ends up, after she has died. It is a place so like Earth, yet completely different. Here Liz will age backward from the day of her death until she becomes a baby again and returns to Earth. But Liz wants to turn sixteen, not fourteen again. She wants to get her driver&#39;s license. She wants to graduate from high school and go to college. And now that she&#39;s dead, Liz is being forced to live a life she doesn&#39;t want with a grandmother she has only just met. And it is not going well. How can Liz let go of the only life she has ever known and embrace a new one? Is it possible that a life lived in reverse is no different from a life lived forward? This moving, often funny book about grief, death, and loss will stay with the reader long after the last page is turned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Elsewhere&lt;/i&gt; by Gabrielle Zevin is a 2006 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
