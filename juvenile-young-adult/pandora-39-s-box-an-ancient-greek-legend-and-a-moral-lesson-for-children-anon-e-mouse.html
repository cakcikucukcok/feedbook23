  <title>PANDORA&#39;S BOX - An Ancient Greek Legend and a Moral Lesson for Children - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 237&lt;br /&gt;
In this 237th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the perennial children&amp;rsquo;s story of Pandora&amp;rsquo;s Box, a story showing how important it is to overcome temptation and also a story to show that when all goes wrong, not all is hopeless and lost forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When our old world was in its tender infancy, there was a child named Epimetheus who never had either father or mother; and that he might not be lonely, another child, fatherless and motherless like himself, was sent by the gods to be his playfellow and helpmate. Her name was Pandora.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first thing that Pandora saw when she entered the cottage where Epimetheus lived was a great box. And almost the first question that she asked was &amp;quot;What is in the box?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Epimetheus answered, &amp;quot;that is a secret, and you must be kind enough not to ask any questions about it. The box was left here to be kept safely, and I do not myself know what it contains&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; and here begins our story&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
So what was in the box, and did Pandora give in to temptation? Download and read the story of Pandora&amp;rsquo;s Box as a lesson to your children, warning them of the dangers of always giving in to temptation and how important it is to learn to overcome it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alternatively, if your children are old enough, give the story for them to read by themselves, for reading creates the theatre of the mind, which is so important in the development of young minds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
