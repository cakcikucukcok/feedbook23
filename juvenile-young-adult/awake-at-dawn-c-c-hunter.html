  <title>Awake at Dawn - C. C. Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step into the world of Shadow Falls, a camp that helps teens tap into their special...talents. Once you visit, you&#39;ll never forget it--and you&#39;ll never, ever be the same.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the moment Kylie Galen arrived at Shadow Falls Camp, she&#39;s had one burning question: What am I? Surrounded by vampires, werewolves, shape-shifters, fairies and witches, Kylie longs to figure out her own supernatural identity...and what her burgeoning powers mean. And now she&#39;ll need them more than ever, because she&#39;s being haunted by a new spirit who insists that someone Kylie knows--and loves--will die before the end of the summer. If only she only knew who she was supposed to save. And how...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But giving Kylie the most trouble is her aching heart. Gorgeous werewolf Lucas left camp with another girl, but he&#39;s still visiting Kylie in her dreams.  And Derek, a sexy half Fae who&#39;s always been there for her when she needed him, is pushing to get more serious--and growing impatient, especially when Lucas returns. Kylie knows she needs to decide between the boys, and it&#39;s tearing her up inside.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet romance will have to wait, because something from the dark side of the supernatural world is hiding in Shadow Falls. It&#39;s about to threaten everything she holds dear...and bring her closer to her destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Awake at Dawn&lt;/i&gt; is the second installment in C.C. Hunter&#39;s young adult fantasy series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
