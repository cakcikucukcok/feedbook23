  <title>Lullaby - Amanda Hocking</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Harper only wanted a safe, normal life. But when her younger sister Gemma runs off with a dangerous clique of beautiful girls, Penn, Thea, and Lexi, everything changes. Vowing to get her sister back no matter what the cost, Harper must face dangers unlike any she&#39;s ever experienced. Fortunately, she has Daniel by her side, a gorgeous guy who&#39;s devoted to helping her find her sister--and who&#39;s immune to the girls&#39; dark powers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Harper searches for her sister, Gemma struggles to adjust to her new life.  Gemma&#39;s powers are growing by the day, and the longer she lives with her new &quot;sisters,&quot; the harder it is to resist entering their magical world.  It&#39;s a realm both dark and beautiful, and where she&#39;s plagued by strange hungers and unspeakable needs.  Just as she&#39;s drifting far away from her old life,  Harper and Daniel find her...but no one can deny how much she&#39;s changed.  All she wants is to return to her family and the mortal world, but how can she do that when she&#39;s become something else entirely--and will they still love her once they learn the truth?&lt;br&gt;Prepare to fall under the spell of &lt;i&gt;Lullaby&lt;/i&gt;, the second book in the Watersong series from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Amanda Hocking.&lt;/p&gt;" />
