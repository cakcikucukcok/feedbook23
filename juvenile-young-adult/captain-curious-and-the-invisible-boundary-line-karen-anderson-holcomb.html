  <title>Captain Curious and the Invisible Boundary Line - Karen Anderson Holcomb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Captain Curious and the Invisible Boundary Line is a story about a little boy named Jasper whose curiosity knows no bounds. When he is drawn into his neighbors yard, past the No Trespassing sign, Jasper gets more than he bargained for. The colorful illustrations of ordinary settings and situations in this book are both amusing and thought-provoking. Verses from Proverbs speak wisdom into the conflict, providing delightful teaching moments for parents. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Karen has gleaned from Proverbs spiritually-rich training for kids by the parental setting of boundaries. Her mastery of the joys and challenges of parenting combined with her sharp wit catch the readers attention from the first page! Her writing is delightful and instructional at the same time. Enjoy the adventure! &lt;br /&gt;

I love this book. I have never seen anything like it  a wonderful book to help children understand and respect personal boundaries. Karens years of ministering with children gives her unique insight into communicating Gods word in ways children can understand. &lt;br /&gt;
