  <title>Right Where I Belong - Krista McGee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Natalia’s about to discover her place in the world . . .&amp;nbsp;and it’s not following in her father’s footsteps.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;After watching her father jump from one marriage to the next, Natalia has completely written off love. And when her father divorces his third wife—the only one who has been a mother to her—Natalia is ready to write him off too.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Needing a change of scenery, Natalia leaves her home in Spain and relocates with her stepmother to sun-soaked Florida. But she didn’t realize just how far a new school, a new culture, and a new lifestyle would push her out of her comfort zone.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;One of her biggest surprises comes from Brian, a pastor’s son with an adorable smile, who loves God with a sincerity that astounds Natalia. She doesn’t want to fall for him, but she can’t seem to avoid him long enough to get him out of her mind.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Love is the last thing Natalia wants. Even so, God has her right where she belongs.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“. . . an absolute gem.” —&lt;I&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/I&gt; TOP PICK for &lt;I&gt;First Date&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
