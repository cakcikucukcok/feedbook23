  <title>The Winner&#39;s Kiss - Marie Rutkoski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;War has begun. Arin is in the thick of it, with the East as his ally and the empire as his enemy. He&#39;s finally managed to dismiss the memory of Kestrel, even if he can&#39;t quite forget her. Kestrel turned into someone he could no longer recognize: someone who cared more for the empire than for the lives of innocent people-and certainly more than she cared for him. At least, that&#39;s what he thinks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But far north lies a work camp where Kestrel is a prisoner. Can she manage to escape before she loses herself? As the war intensifies, both Kestrel and Arin discover unexpected roles in battle, terrible secrets, and a fragile hope. The world is changing. The East is pitted against the West, and Kestrel and Arin are caught between. In a game like this, can anybody really win?&lt;/p&gt;" />
