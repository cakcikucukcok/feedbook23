  <title>The King&#39;s Jewel - Sarena, Sasha Nanua</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;CENTER&gt;A new journey begins&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;An invisible force pushed me back to the solid forest ground. The portal sealed off with one last burst of light, and then I was left alone with the eerily tall trees.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;I lay on the forest floor for a moment, shuddering from the encounter with the woman. I pushed myself off the ground and crossed the dirty forest path to the twins house, still jittering. It didnt take long for me to register the familiarity of the woman: her black hair, charcoal eyes, venomous tone.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;The headmistress was back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;b&gt;AFTER AN UNTHINKABLE BATTLE&lt;/b&gt;, Arica Miller is bursting with questions. The last thing she expected was to go to the source of all magicthe Sorcerers Underworld. She soon realizes the magical world is facing an immense threat: The kings crown, also known as the Jewel, has been stolen by an unknown thief. And whats worse, the gemstones have been taken by a magical flood that has a suspicious link to the headmistress.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Now Arica and her cousins are summoned to go on a dangerous search that leads them to the waters of the Bermuda Triangle. If Arica wishes to return home, she must find the gemstones and unlock the mystery of the Jewels thief; but what she doesnt realize is that the culprit could be closer to her than shed ever imagined....&lt;/P&gt;" />
