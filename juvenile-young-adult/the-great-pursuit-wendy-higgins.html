  <title>The Great Pursuit - Wendy Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In&lt;em&gt; The Great Pursuit&lt;/em&gt;, the dramatic sequel to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Great Hunt, &lt;/em&gt;Wendy Higgins delivers another thrilling fantasy filled with dangerous enemies, political intrigue, searing romance, and a princess who is willing to do everything to protect her kingdom. &lt;em&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hunt has ended, but the pursuit for love and justice continues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The kingdom of Lochlanach has traded the great beast that once terrorized the realm of Eurona for something far more dangerous: the ire of powerful Lashed woman Rosaria Rocato. Rosaria demands that Eurona overturn the laws prohibiting magic, or an innocent will be killed each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the king&amp;#8217;s resistance, Princess Aerity believes they must make peace with the Lashed, and though she&amp;#8217;s accepted a betrothal to the man who took down the beast, she cannot help thinking about Paxton, the Lashed man who stole her heart and disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aerity soon discovers that Paxton has joined Rosaria&amp;#8217;s army in the war against her family. Though her feelings for him are still strong, her duty to her kingdom and her family is stronger&amp;#8212;especially when her parents are kidnapped and she has to step up to the throne and once again put aside what&amp;#8217;s best for her in order to do what&amp;#8217;s best for her people. Paxton and Princess Aerity must fight to see what is more powerful: their love or the impending war between the magical Lashed and the non-magic humans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
