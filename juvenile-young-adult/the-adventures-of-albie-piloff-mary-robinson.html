  <title>The Adventures of Albie Piloff - Mary Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Albie, a small, white, knitted teddy bear, finds himself in a consignment of toys destined for sale in a London Toy/Gift shop. Although bullied mercilessly by self-styled superior toys, he is sustained by the desire to help his creator, Sophie, who has fallen on hard times. 
Lost, lonely and homesick he meets and is befriended by Henri, a larger than life feisty mouse. In an effort to right the wrongs of Albies situation, Henri involves him in a daring plan which doesnt go quite as well as expected. Later, Albie has an accident and is badly injured. Could this be the end for Albie? Can anyone save the poor bear? 
Without a thought for his own safety, Henris brave actions result in his capture and an appointment with the sinister Dr. Drawblood. Desperately unhappy and afraid, his thoughts turn to escape but can he think of a plan in time? 
Will the two friends ever meet again and will Sophie get the help she desperately needs? 
Magic, mystery and humour combine with a host of colourful characters to bring this page-turning adventure story to life." />
