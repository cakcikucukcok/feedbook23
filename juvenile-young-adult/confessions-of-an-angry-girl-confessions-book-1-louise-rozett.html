        &lt;p&gt;#1: I&#39;m livid all the time. Why? My dad died. My mom barely talks. My brother abandoned us. I think I&#39;m allowed to be irate, don&#39;t you?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;#2: I make people furious regularly. Want an example? I kissed Jamie Forta, a badass guy who might be dating a cheerleader. She is now enraged and out for blood. Mine.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;#3: High school might as well be Mars. My best friend has been replaced by an alien, and I see red all the time. (Mars is red and &quot;seeing red&quot; means being angry—get it?)&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Here are some other vocab words that describe my life: Inadequate. Insufferable. Intolerable. (Don&#39;t know what they mean? Look them up yourself.) (Sorry. That was rude.)&lt;/p&gt;
