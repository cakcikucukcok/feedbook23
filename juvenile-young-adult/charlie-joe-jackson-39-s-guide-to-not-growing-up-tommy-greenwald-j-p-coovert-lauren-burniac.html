  <title>Charlie Joe Jackson&#39;s Guide to Not Growing Up - Tommy Greenwald, J.  P. Coovert, Lauren Burniac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Yes! Graduation day is finally here! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charlie Joe has been waiting for this moment his entire middle school career.  This might even be the best day of his life. No more teachers! No more books! Just make it through the ceremony and he&#39;s free. But suddenly things around him are starting to change. Words like &quot;responsibility&quot; and &quot;college prep&quot; keep popping out of his friend&#39;s mouths. What happened to words like &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;pool party&quot;? And come to think of it, doesn&#39;t high school bring more teachers and more books? Maybe this whole growing up thing isn&#39;t such a good idea after all. Actually being a kid is pretty darn fun! Surely Charlie Joe can figure out a way to put the brakes on growing up-and fast!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hilarious final installment in the Charlie Joe Jackson series written by Tommy Greenwald and illustrated by J. P. Coovert is infused with nostalgia and just the right amount of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;" />
