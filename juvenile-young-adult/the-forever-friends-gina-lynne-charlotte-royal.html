  <title>The Forever Friends - Gina Lynne, Charlotte Royal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Manny, the little brown bear longs for a friend. But not just any friend. He longs for a Forever Friend. He wishes for a friend he can play with and laugh with, and dance and sing with. He wishes for a friend he can share all his happy thoughts and all his sad thoughts with. Find out what happens when Manny rescues a little white rabbit from a hunter&#39;s trap. Then follow them on their adventures as they happily explore their forest neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;He looked at his new friend with wonder and said, And I dont even know exactly WHY I was laughing! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, she said, I was just so happy to be free and so relieved you didnt want to eat me that I just started laughing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eat you?! Oh, no! Oh, yuck! Oh, gross! No way! said Manny Bear, in a very shocked voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuck? What do you mean.YUCK! the little white rabbit asked in a huffy tone. Dont you think I would taste good? Whats wrong with me? I am not gross or yuck! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then realizing it might sound as if she were inviting him to have a taste she changed her mind. In a tiny voice, she said, Never mind. Im sure I must taste just awful anyway.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The little white rabbit sat up and offered her tiny paw to Manny Bear. He took it very gently in his much bigger paw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said, My name is Missy Rabbit and I am very pleased to meet you. Thank you for saving me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then they looked at each other and began to laugh all over again. By the time they finished laughing they were the best of friends. They were Forever Friends.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
