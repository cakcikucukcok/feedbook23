  <title>LILLEKORT - A French Fairy Tale for Children - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 357&lt;br /&gt;
In this 357th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the French Fairy Tale &amp;quot;LILLEKORT&amp;rdquo;, or Short Lille.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long time ago and far, far away, there was once a man and his wife who were very, very poor, and had a great many children. Each year added one to the number. One year the wife gave birth to a beautiful boy, who, on opening his eyes, cried:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dearest mother, give me some of my brother&amp;#39;s old clothes, and food for two days, and I will go into the world and seek my fortune, for I see you have enough children here without me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Heaven forbid, my child!&amp;quot; exclaimed the mother. &amp;quot;You are much too young to leave the house.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
But the little one insisted; so at length his mother gave him some clothes and some food, and he departed, full of joy. Lillekort (for so he named himself) travelled towards the east.&lt;br /&gt;
And so begins the adventures of Lillekort &amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened to Lillekort you ask&amp;hellip;? Where did he go and whom did he encounter? Was he successful in all his adventures? Well many things happened, some strange, some fun and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
