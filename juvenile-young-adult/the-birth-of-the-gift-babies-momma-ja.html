&lt;p&gt;We are gifts for all of His little children, but most especially for those with extreme challenges. These are the kids who face physical, emotional, mental, and social challenges. He wants us to cheer them on and encourage their families and caregivers. He knows that these caregivers are the special people who do all thats possible to make life all it can be for the challenged little ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are grateful for the chance to serve all of you by showing His love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was created to be a solution to some problem or need that someone else has. We are going to help special-needs children, their families, and the rest of the world find out how they were created with that purpose too just like everyone else. This book is about how He created us.&lt;br /&gt;
