  <title>No School for Evil Eraser! - Tiffany Tunbull-Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an easy read book with appealing characters and colorful illustrations. The main characters besides R.K. are school supplies that come to life in a fun-filled story that will entertain you and teach you a few valuable lessons. The story is about a young boy named R.K. that will be starting school as a fourth grader and he is so excited. His mother told him to make sure that he packs his book bag with all of his school supplies so that he can be fully prepared for school. The school supplies become real-life characters in a nicely written story that will capture your heart and blow your mind. This is a fun, upbeat, and engaging story for young readers of all ages. So make sure to read it and then tell others about it.
     This book is dedicated to the loving memory of my parents 
         Elvin &quot;Chico&quot; Turnbull and Delores &quot;De&quot; Mae Turnbull.
 My two handsome sons were my inspiration for this book. I love you, Roosevelt (aka Lil Rose) and Ryan (aka R.K.) Thanks for making motherhood a blessing each and everyday.
The author also expresses her gratitude to her husband, big sister, Uncle Louis, Godmother Mattie, the Kennedy family, the Tucker family, the Cooks family, the Sheppard family, Maryland Avenue Baptist Church family(always home), her current church, Salem Baptist Church(greatest church in the world), her Bff crew, her posse at work, and everyone else that have touched her heart or stimulated her mind.
                                              Coming Soon
                            &quot;Be Good, Evil Eraser, Be Good!&quot;" />
