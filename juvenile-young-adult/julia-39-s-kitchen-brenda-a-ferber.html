  <title>Julia&#39;s Kitchen - Brenda A. Ferber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cara Segal is a born worrier. She figures her worrying works like a whisper in God&#39;s ear - if Cara&#39;s concerned about car crashes, kidnappings, or murders, she lets God know, and he always spares her. But Cara never thought to worry about a fire. And one night while she&#39;s sleeping at a friend&#39;s house, her house catches fire, and her mother and younger sister are both killed. Throughout shiva, the initial Jewish mourning period, Cara can&#39;t help wondering about God&#39;s role in the tragedy. And what is her father&#39;s role in her life now? He walks around like a ghost and refuses to talk about the fire. Cara longs for her family and her home, where sweet smells filled the house as Cara&#39;s mom filled orders for her catering business, Julia&#39;s Kitchen. Then one day a call comes in for a cookie order, and Cara gets a wild idea. Maybe by bringing back Julia&#39;s Kitchen, she can find a way to reconnect with everything she&#39;s lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete with a glossary of Hebrew and Yiddish terms and a recipe for chocolate chip cookies, this debut novel is a joyous tribute to the resiliency of the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Julia&#39;s Kitchen&lt;/i&gt; is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
