      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A taut psychological thriller for teens&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Jeff thought he would never again have to deal with his older brother, a convicted murderer serving a life sentence. But after six years, Troy&#39;s sentence has been overturned on a technicality and he is released from prison. He returns to a family deeply divided about having him back home. Jeff can&#39;t forget how his life was disrupted by his brother, how his family had to move to another state and start over. Still, his parents believe things will be different now. But Troy&#39;s return makes a mess of Jeff &#39;s life - at home, at school, and with his girlfriend. When Jeff &#39;s rival on the soccer field turns up missing, Jeff suspects Troy is involved, and he sets out to prove it. But nothing could prepare Jeff for what happens as he gets closer to the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With unexpected flashes of humor, David Klass once again gives readers a gripping, multilayered novel about good and evil and the powerful bonds of family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dark Angel&lt;/i&gt; is a 2006 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
