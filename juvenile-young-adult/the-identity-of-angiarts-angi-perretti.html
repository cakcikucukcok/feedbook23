  <title>The Identity of &quot;Angiarts&quot; - Angi Perretti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="INTRODUCING !!
An Art Zealot with Super Powers from the Art Gods!
An Adventurous Muse for Artistic Inspiration!!
A perpetually adventurous muse is on a mission to inspire the cultural history of the City Beautiful!  The Identity of AngiArts is a modern-day legend that stages the fictitious life and identity transformation of a 21st century comic-book-style cartoon character for the Arts.  I created this identity with the sole intention to rally and promote the arts and culture movement in downtown Orlando.  The story narrates her fairy-tale life before the reality of her current presencewhere she came from and how she got here; who she is today and why she landed in downtown Orlando.
This Letterbook Story you hold in your hands was written to be read while relaxing on a picnic blanket on the shores of the beautiful Lake Eola.  It stages an interactive, literary theatre experience like no other.  This vintage letterbook story book becomes a keepsake for all cultural book lovers.  Journal your &quot;genie magic&quot; experience inside the book to document a soulful revelation that may lead to unimaginable places of joy.  
After a brief adventure through story-book fantasy, art sculpture lovers, letterboxing enthusiasts, and other literary adventurers are instructed to follow the monument map at the end of the story to find the legendary landing spot of AngiArts.  Your mission is to ponder a moment of soulful self-prophecy, while embarking on a personal quest for artistic inspiration.  Letterboxers, seek the letterbox treasure cache hidden somewhere at the AA landing sight.  Poof!  Youre there!  Dont forget to bring your logbooks.  And, Leave No Trace.  You are standing at the Monument for Artistic Inspiration.
But what is this book really about?  Its about a lot of things at once!  Its about a soulful revelation in my life to reinvent myself; Its about a little farm girl from Miami who tells the story of her childhood dreams in fairy-tale format; Its about imagining something very original.  Yet, I was totally inspired by all the great artistic icons of the second millennium, like Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and even the great American icons like Norman Rockwell and Charles M. Schulz.  But reallyits all about making art happen in my community the AngiArts way.
The Identity of AngiArts is the result of a personal, inner-thought process that has possessed me to react with such intensity.  It dramatizes a heart-quakin and a soul-shakin adventure, delving deeply into the fantasy of my dreams, but resurfacing its way upwardright back into my present lifeturning full circle to portray my unique Walking~Works~of~Art creations to you.  I hope you get just as much fun and laughter reading this book as I did writing it!" />
