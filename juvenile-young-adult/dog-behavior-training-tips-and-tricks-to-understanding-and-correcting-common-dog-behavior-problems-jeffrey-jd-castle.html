You need to know the best and most efficient way of taking care of your dog, especially when you&amp;#39;re not around. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since every breed is different, this book will cover the basis of how you should treat your dog regardless of the type of breed you own. Pretty soon, your dog will be doing fun tricks like shake or roll over and you&amp;#39;ll have exclusive bragging rights as a dog owner." />
