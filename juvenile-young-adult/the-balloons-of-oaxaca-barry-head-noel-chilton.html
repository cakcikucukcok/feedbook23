  <title>The Balloons of Oaxaca - Barry Head, Noel Chilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set in the south of Mexico, this is the realistic, colorful story of one childs rough road into the modern world. 
From what hes heard, Utuyu, about six years old, thinks the city of Oaxaca sounds like a marvelous place. It looks different, though, when he finds himself there all alone, hungry and homeless, nearly run over by the traffic, not knowing how money works or where to get any, and even unable to speak the language of the people around him. Theres a lot Utuyu has to learn--and fast!--if he is to survive.
Utuyus adventures make a tale of determination, courage and resourcefulness as he learns to cope with feelings all children share.
Charmingly illustrated, The Balloons of Oaxaca makes perfect bedtime reading in the old tradition. Its readable to five-year-olds and readable by ten-year-olds themselves.
