  <title>A Call for Character - Cynthia Gadson, Maurice Lindsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story highlight character traits with alliteration and personification. The animals are depicted as human-like characters.
Have you ever known animals to care about how other animals behaved?  
You are about to experience a group of extraordinary animals that believe in the importance of having good character traits.  These animals rely on one another to accomplish a positive experience.  Some of the characters depicted are concerned about the quality of good character traits such as being accountable, committed, compassionate, cooperative, courageous, honest, kind, leaders, neighborly, respectful, responsible, and trustworthy.
Long ago in a community called Love Land, there lived animals with good character traits.  Love Land was invaded by animals with bad character that were taking over the land of good to turn it into a land of animals with bad or negative character.  Love Land was once a peaceful place but became full of chaos and confusion.
Find out why good character traits are necessary to accomplish positive results and how poor character traits can produce negative or non-productive results during a time when the circus came to town." />
