  <title>Mouse in the House - Laura A. Allen, Amanda Maitri Mullenbach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the teeny tiny mouse moves from the field into the great big house, hes pleased with his surroundings. He loves exploring and eating the crumbs from the kitchen floor. There is one person, though, who is not happy with the mouses new digs. Mr. Billings is not pleased there is a mouse in the house and sets traps to get rid of the new guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Mr. Billings kids think a mouse in the house is cool, and they convince him to be their friend. They feed him, play with him, and even warn him about where the traps are set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rhyming picture book for children based on a true story, Mouse in the House tells the tale of one little mouse who lives on, eager to entertain and educate. Just as life is full of lessons to learn, this story offers topics for guided discussion, including fear, empathy, acceptance, and rightness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
