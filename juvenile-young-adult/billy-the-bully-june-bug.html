  <title>Billy the Bully - June Bug</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Billy the Bully&lt;/i&gt; is the story of William Alistar and the event that changed the direction of his life forever. Billys young life began the same as most; he lived with his father and mother and had a good childhood. Then one sad day, after losing his beloved parents in an accident, Billy had to go live with his grandfather who lived alone in another town. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billys grandpa loved him dearly and taught him to read and love the Bible and to be a good person. Then, when Billy was nine, his grandpa died and Billy had to go into foster care. He was placed in several different homes but would eventually need to move to another foster home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At school, the children call him Billy the Bully because they are afraid of him. Billys heart is full of hard, black anger against the world and everyone in it. He shows that anger by being mean and rude. He does everything he can to push people away so they keep their distance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then one amazing day Billy unexpectedly finds himself in a dark, mysterious forest where he is given a glimpse into the lives of the people he has hurt. When he leaves the forest, his life is changed forever. &lt;i&gt;Billy the Bully&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of a young boy whose childhood is challenging but who eventually finds the way to happiness and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
