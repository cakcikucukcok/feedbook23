  <title>The Vestige - Peri Similien</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Experience the suspense and magic of the young adult fantasy bestseller&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;An epic paranormal romance that takes &amp;quot;coming-of-age&amp;quot; to a whole new level.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Editorial review: the bestselling author says, &amp;quot;This is an epic journey of pain, growth, friendship, love, and loyalty. With a whole new genealogical system that will fascinate you, full of historical references and botanical research and a fresh take on man&amp;#39;s determination that will leave you breathless.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Shali, it is time to get up,&amp;rdquo; the voice called out once more. Shali rolled over in her comfortable bed, and she opened her eyes to see her mother standing above her with a pleasant smile. She was not quite awake but sat up, yawned, then stretched her arms, willing her body to respond. Her mother, a petite Asian woman, named Aswang, sat on the bed next to Shali and rubbed her back. When she was satisfied her daughter was fully awake, she leaned over and gave her daughter a quick peck on the cheek.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days like this were routine for this loving family of three who lived in the quiet isolation of Sector Seven with 100 other families just like theirs. For the most part, Shali&amp;rsquo;s day started off by doing her morning chores, which included making her bed and sweeping the front porch, along with several other menial tasks that kept a home comfortable. After that, it was off to the kitchen to help Aswang prepare the fruits, berries and &amp;ldquo;mintu,&amp;rdquo; a sweet finely ground oatmeal porridge that was her mother&amp;rsquo;s specialty. The dish was served at breakfast on most days. The pleasant smell of mintu drew her into the kitchen. She walked through the sun-drenched living room and noticed the natural light coming through a window on the far sidewall. She stopped to look for a moment, delighting at the kaleidoscopic pattern the light, passing through the colorful drapes, made on the hardwood floor.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;An engrossing YA urban fantasy with a powerful message about preserving family.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;
