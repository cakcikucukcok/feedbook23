  <title>I Am an Eagle! - Dwayne L. Taylor, Chad J. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mother and Father Eagle eagerly await the arrival of their baby eagles when the winds of a violent thunderstorm sweep through the forest and carry the nest away. Mother Eagle saves two of the eggs from her nest before it disappears into the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nest lands on a farm outside of a chicken coop. After the storm clears and the sun rises, chickens emerge from their coop to find the displaced nest containing a single egg. The chickens roll the surviving egg into the coop and Everett, an eagle, is born among the chicks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chicks tease Everett because his appearance is oddly different, and he has difficulty looking for food and eating as they do. Everett often looks to the birds flying high in the sky and longs to do the same. The chicks taunt Everetts dream of flying because, of course, chickens cannot fly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everett is then discovered and rescued by a large eagle who introduces him to Hannah, a young female eagle. The two become friends, and Hannah helps Everett realize hes not a chicken. In fact, hes an eagle. Hannah sets out to help Everett achieve his dream of flying high in the sky the way eagles should.&lt;/p&gt;" />
