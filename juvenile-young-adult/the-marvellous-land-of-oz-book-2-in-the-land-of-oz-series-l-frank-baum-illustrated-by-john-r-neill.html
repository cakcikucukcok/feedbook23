  <title>THE MARVELLOUS LAND OF OZ - Book 2 in the Land of Oz series - L. Frank Baum, Illustrated by John R. Neill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Marvellous Land of Oz&lt;/b&gt;: Being an Account of the Further Adventures of the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, and is often shortened to &amp;ldquo;The Land of Oz.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
This is the second of L. Frank Baum&amp;#39;s books set in the Land of Oz, and is the sequel to &lt;b&gt;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This and the next 34 Oz books of the famous 40 were illustrated by John R. Neill. This book has 14 full-page colour plates plus over 130 pen-and-ink drawings.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The events are set shortly after the events in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and after Dorothy Gale&amp;#39;s departure back to Kansas. Our protagonist of the novel is an orphan boy called Tip who has been under the guardianship of a cruel Wicked Witch named Mombi (the main antagonist) and lives in the northern quadrant of Oz called Gillikin Country. Mombi has always been extremely mean and abusive to Tip always threatening to transform him into a marble statue to punish him for his mischievous ways.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To avoid being turned into a marble statue, Tip runs away with Jack Pumpkinhead stealing the Powder of Life. He uses it to animate the wooden Sawhorse for Jack to ride.&lt;br /&gt;
