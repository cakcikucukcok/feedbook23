  <title>Cyber Snoop Nation - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sixteen-year-old Cybersnoop, Littanie Webster, color coordinated down to her underwear in denim and a Greek fisherman&#39;s cap, sat with her legs folded under her in &#39;the cage.&#39; &quot;Welcome to Cyber Snoop Nation,&quot; she specified. &lt;P&gt;It was eighty degrees inside the recording booth and humid. On the advice of her lawyer, she decided on a guest for the evening at the last possible minute-Gene Wright.
&lt;p&gt;He wheeled his desk chair in a semi-circle and clicked a ball point pen nervously until she extended her hand and steadied him. Her voice was courteous, but patronizing. &quot;We&#39;re on the air in five seconds-no background noise, please!&quot; He braced his chair against her desk. 
&lt;p&gt;She pinched the pen out of his fingers and tossed it into a cup filled with pencils. He grabbed it from the cup, spilling the contents over with a crashing sound.
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Klutz!&quot; She screamed in a whisper. &quot;You&#39;d make a fortune in comedy reviving the Three Stooges.&quot; 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s my gold award pen.&quot; Gene looked up at her with the child in himself giving her the pout of a newborn lamb.  
&lt;p&gt;The red lights blinked &quot;On Air,&quot; and her silver gaze of false innocence imploded into a critical squint. &quot;We have a surprise guest tonight, folks,&quot; she murmured mysteriously. The words tingled strangely on her tongue.   
&lt;p&gt;A caller, Gene Wright, nursed the microphone as if it were too precious to defile. &quot;Why would someone offer a foreign guy two million to murder you?&quot;" />
