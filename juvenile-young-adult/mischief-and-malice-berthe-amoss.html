  <title>Mischief and Malice - Berthe Amoss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in New Orleans, Louisiana, on the eve of World War II, &lt;i&gt;Mischief and Malice&lt;/i&gt; is a brand new work from an iconic figure in young adult literature. Following the death of her Aunt Eveline, fourteen-year old Addie&amp;#8212;who we first met in Berthe Amoss&#39;s classic &lt;i&gt;Secret Lives&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8212;is now living with her Aunt Tooise, Uncle Henry, and her longtime rival cousin, Sandra Lee. A new family has just moved into Addie&#39;s former house, including a young girl who is just Addie&#39;s age. Meanwhile, Louis, the father of Tom, Addie&#39;s lifelong neighbor and best friend, suddenly returns after having disappeared when Tom was a baby. Between school dances, organizing a Christmas play, fretting about her hair, and a blossoming romance with Tom, Addie stumbles upon a mystery buried in the Great Catch All, an ancient giant armoire filled with heirlooms of her family&#39;s past, which holds a devastating secret that could destroy Louis and Tom&#39;s lives. Once again, Berthe Amoss has created an indelible portrait of a young girl coming of age in prewar New Orleans.&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, &lt;b&gt;Berthe Amoss&lt;/b&gt; is the author and illustrator of twenty-eight children&#39;s and young adult books. Her picture book &lt;i&gt;The Cajun Gingerbread Boy&lt;/i&gt; won a Children&#39;s Choice Award, and her YA novel &lt;i&gt;The Chalk Cross&lt;/i&gt; was a finalist for the Edgar Allen Poe Award. She lives on the Gulf Coast in Pass Christian, Mississippi.&lt;/div&gt;" />
