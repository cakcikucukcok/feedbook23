  <title>Markswoman - Rati Mehrotra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An order of magical-knife wielding female assassins brings both peace and chaos to their post-apocalyptic world in this bewitching blend of science fiction and epic fantasy&amp;#8212;the first entry in a debut duology that displays the inventiveness of the works of Sarah Beth Durst and Marie Lu.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyra is the youngest Markswoman in the Order of Kali, one of a handful of sisterhoods of highly trained elite warriors. Armed with blades whose metal is imbued with magic and guided by a strict code of conduct, the Orders are sworn to keep the peace and protect the people of Asiana. Kyra has pledged to do so&amp;#8212;yet she secretly harbors a fierce desire to avenge her murdered family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Tamsyn, the powerful and dangerous Mistress of Mental Arts, assumes control of the Order, Kyra is forced on the run. She is certain that Tamsyn committed murder in a twisted bid for power, but she has no proof.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kyra escapes through one of the strange Transport Hubs that are the remnants of Asiana&amp;#8217;s long-lost past and finds herself in the unforgiving wilderness of a desert that is home to the Order of Khur, the only Order composed of men. Among them is Rustan, a disillusioned Marksman whose skill with a blade is unmatched. He understands the desperation of Kyra&amp;#8217;s quest to prove Tamsyn&amp;#8217;s guilt, and as the two grow closer, training daily on the windswept dunes of Khur, both begin to question their commitment to their Orders. But what they don&amp;#8217;t yet realize is that the line between justice and vengeance is thin . . . as thin as the blade of a knife.&lt;/p&gt;" />
