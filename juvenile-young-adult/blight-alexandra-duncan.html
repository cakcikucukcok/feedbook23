  <title>Blight - Alexandra Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When an agribusiness facility producing genetically engineered food releases a deadly toxin into the environment, seventeen-year-old Tempest Torres races to deliver the cure before time runs out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the author of the acclaimed American Booksellers Association&amp;#8217;s Indies Introduce pick &lt;em&gt;Salvage&lt;/em&gt;, which was called &amp;#8220;Brilliant, feminist science fiction&amp;#8221; by Stephanie Perkins, the internationally bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Anna and the French Kiss&lt;/em&gt;. This stand-alone action-adventure story is perfect for fans of &lt;em&gt;Oryx and Crake&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The House of the Scorpion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seventeen-year-old Tempest Torres has lived on the AgraStar farm north of Atlanta, Georgia, since she was found outside its gates at the age of five. Now she&amp;#8217;s part of the security force guarding the fence and watching for scavengers&amp;#8212;people who would rather steal genetically engineered food from the Company than work for it. When a group of such rebels accidentally sets off an explosion in the research compound, it releases into the air a blight that kills every living thing in its path&amp;#8212;including humans. With blight-resistant seeds in her pocket, Tempest teams up with a scavenger boy named Alder and runs for help. But when they finally arrive at AgraStar headquarters, they discover that there&amp;#8217;s an even bigger plot behind the blight&amp;#8212;and it&amp;#8217;s up to them to stop it from happening again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by current environmental issues, specifically the genetic adjustment of seeds to resist blight and the risks of not allowing natural seed diversity, this is an action-adventure story that is Margaret Atwood&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Oryx and Crake&lt;/em&gt; meets Nancy Farmer&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;House of the Scorpion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;" />
