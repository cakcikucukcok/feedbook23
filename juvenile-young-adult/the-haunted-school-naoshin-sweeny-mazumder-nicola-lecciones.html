  <title>The Haunted School - Naoshin Sweeny Mazumder, Nicola Lecciones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There was a girl named Angela, and she went to school. One day she opened her drawer and found a book. She took the book home and then opened it to read it. But she found out that was not a book but a diary about a young girl named Clarissa who died on the day of Halloween.
Angela searched the name Clarissa in the portfolio of her class and then found an ID for Clarissa. She read it and then stopped. Death date, she said. She looked at the day. It was on Halloween. Her birthday was on Halloween.
The next day, she went to school, and after the class when everybody had left, Angela read the diary and then heard the doorknob twisting. She put down the papers and hid them back and ran. Angela told the story about Clarissa to her friends, and they told her Clarissa looked a lot like her and that there was a legend about her. Angelas friends told her that there was a portrait of Clarissa in the school basement.
One day, Angela went to the school basement after class. When she went down to the basement, she looked around and thought it was like a castle. She saw lots of portraits of the kids who were in the school, principals, teachers. And she walked around the room until she found portraits from 1935.
The she saw Clarissas name. She looked at the picture and softly touched it. For some reason, she felt weird. She then felt dizzy and took the elevator and ran home." />
