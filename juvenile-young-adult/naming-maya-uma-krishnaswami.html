Soon Maya is drawn into a complicated friendship with eccentric Kamala Mami, who has been a housekeeper and cook for years in Maya&#39;s extended family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Maya is thrust into an ocean of memories, all coming at her too quickly for her to understand. In particular, she is forced to examine the history of her parents&#39; divorce -- all the more painful because she believes the trouble began with the choosing of her name. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years the tension has simmered in a cauldron of anxiety, secrets, and misunderstandings.
