      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Secrets can be dangerous . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wrangler&#39;s Secret &lt;/i&gt;by Louise Ladd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drew Diamond didn&#39;t know just how much he wanted a dog until he first set eyes on the little Labrador puppy. But his father is dead set against it. No problem. Chris thinks she has a surefire plan to help Drew get his puppy--until her plan backfires big time. To make matters worse, the new wrangler, Jamie, is acting strangely. Even though he is great with the guests, he is making too many silly mistakes. Chris figures the problem is that Jamie is new. But when an act of carelessness on his part nearly costs her horse Belle her life, Chris can&#39;t excuse Jamie anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie is hiding something.
