  <title>iCarly &amp; co. - Arianna Di Benedetto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A fanfiction from iCarly, the teen sitcom originally created by Dan Schneider.
iCarly is an American teen sitcom created by Dan Schneider, which premiered on 2007 on Nickelodeon. In the TV show, Carly Shay, her best friend Sam and her neighbor Freddie air a show on the Internet live with a video camera. The peculiarity of this sitcom is the use of original sketches created by young viewers-that contribute to episodes of the show online by uploading their content.
Arianna Di Benedetto, in the best tradition of fanfiction, invented other episodes of popular series.
In the book there are also scenes created by Victorious, Big Time Rush and Gossip Girl, known television series.
At the end of the book is an original story by Arianna Di Benedetto.
Fan fiction or fan fiction (commonly abbreviated to fanfic, FF or fic) is the term used to denote all those works written by fans (hence the name), taking as inspiration the stories or characters of an original work.
The phenomenon has existed in the past: for example, some stories of Sherlock Holmes, written by fans of the character, can be considered works of this kind.
The spread of fan fiction is, however, exploded with the arrival of the internet. The works are created by fans for giving a personal view of history.
