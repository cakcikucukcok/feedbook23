  <title>THE THIRD BOOK OF DRAGONS - 12 more tales of dragons - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by John Halsted</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The THIRD BOOK OF DRAGONS is the third instalment following in the footsteps of Edith Nesbit&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Book of Dragon&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; and John Halsted&amp;rsquo;s compilation &amp;ldquo;The Second book of Dragons&amp;rdquo;. Here, John Halsted, author and folklorist, has compiled &amp;ldquo;The Third Book of Dragons&amp;rdquo; from numerous sources as before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book you will find 12 illustrated tales of dragons and serpents drawn from the mists of time. Some are friendly dragons which provide wisdom and direction to the heroes of our stories. Others are downright wicked, oozing malice and evil, leaving the hero of the story no option but to destroy the spiteful, fire-breathing, beast. Our heroes always sally forth wilfully, but cautiously, engaging these ancient creatures to save a damsel in distress, or their families, from sure destruction and banishment to oblivion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find the stories of:&lt;br /&gt;
Orestes And The Dragon&lt;br /&gt;
The Three Princes, The Three Dragons, &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp; The Old&amp;nbsp; Woman With The Iron Nose&lt;br /&gt;
The Dragon&amp;#39;s Teeth&lt;br /&gt;
The Hunting Princes&lt;br /&gt;
The Student Who Was Forcibly Made King&lt;br /&gt;
Vitazko The Victorious&lt;br /&gt;
The Three Princes&lt;br /&gt;
Batcha And The Dragon&lt;br /&gt;
Shepherd Paul&lt;br /&gt;
The Dragon-Giant And His Stone-Steed&lt;br /&gt;
The Semi-Sentimental Dragon&lt;br /&gt;
The Dragon Of Wantley&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These tales have been drawn from old and forgotten books often with their original illustrations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We invite you to download this book and sit back and enjoy a romp through the middle-ages and medieval times when people really did believe in Dragons which could fly.&lt;br /&gt;
