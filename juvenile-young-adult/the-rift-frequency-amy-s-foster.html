But that&amp;#8217;s not easy when she&amp;#8217;s traveling the multiverse with Levi, the painfully guarded Citadel who shoved Ezra through in the first place. And Ryn is quickly learning that inside the multiverse there is no normal&amp;#8212;it&amp;#8217;s adapt, or die&amp;#8212;and the one weapon she really needs to win the war back home is the truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
