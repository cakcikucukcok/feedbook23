  <title>Anderson Castle - Connie Furnari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Archie is seventeen years old and lives in Jersey City, New Jersey, he loves reading horror books but, unlike his friends, he has a special power: he is a psychic, he can foresee the future and he can sense things that the human consciousness ignores.&lt;br/&gt;
