Would love be strong enough to survive the fight? Either way, there&#39;s no turning back.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Empyrean is the only home 15-year-old Waverly has ever known. Part of the first generation to be successfully conceived in deep space, she and her boyfriend Kieran will be pioneers of New Earth. Waverly knows she must marry young in order to have children who can carry on the mission, and Kieran, the handsome captain-to-be, has everything Waverly could want in a husband. Everyone is sure he&#39;s the best choice. Still, there&#39;s a part of Waverly that wants more from life than marriage, and she is secretly intrigued by the shy, darkly brilliant Seth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, Waverly&#39;s dreams are interrupted by the inconceivable - a violent betrayal by the Empyrean&#39;s sister ship, the New Horizon. The New Horizon&#39;s leaders are desperate to populate the new planet first, and will do anything to get what they need: young girls. In one pivotal moment, Waverly and Kieran are separated, and find themselves at the helm of dangerous missions, where every move has potentially devastating consequences, and decisions of the heart may lead to disaster.&lt;br&gt;Pulse-pounding and addictive, &lt;i&gt;Glow&lt;/i&gt; begins Amy Kathleen Ryan&#39;s Sky Chasers--the most riveting series since The Hunger Games.&lt;/p&gt;" />
