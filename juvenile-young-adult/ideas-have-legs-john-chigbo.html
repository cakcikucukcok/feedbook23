  <title>Ideas Have Legs - John Chigbo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ideas have legs, legs that can build but cannot walk, legs that can grow but cannot stroll.
All great things start in the mind of thinkers as ideas of one thing or the other. Ideas may lead to build a new thing; to improve upon something already existing or to destroy it.
Most inventions or discoveries over the years started in this way. When an idea fails to germinate the seed dies. It follows a dream, and like many dreams it could bear fruits or perish like a burnt oak tree. The best way to nourish ideas to fruition is to put things on paper. Write them down and do not procrastinate with getting things started; otherwise it will fizzle away, disappear in thin air like it never occurred. This book is part of a dream come true. I have being nursing the idea of writing for many years; and have actually authored and compiled a number
of booklets before this Ideas have legs.
Ideas have legs therefore is the assembled thoughts of John Chigbo
on various topical issues; some offering solutions to mundane problems, others providing insight, and developing ideas on business projects. I am sure you will find some of the articles perhaps useful and stimulating. This is my minute contribution to the avalanche of publications in the market for various reasons. Mine is a hobby or past timetake your pick." />
