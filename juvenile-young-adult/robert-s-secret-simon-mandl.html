  <title>Robert’S Secret - Simon Mandl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adventurous Robert decides to walk across a frozen lake. Suddenly he falls through the ice and sinks to the bottom where he meets an elf with magic powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distraught and desperate the elf tells Robert that his two sons are being held hostage in a house by the lake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eager to help others he offers to rescue the young elves. Robert discovers that the only way into the house is by going down the chimney. He climbs up a tree, drops onto the roof and enters the house by descending the chimney. He located the two boys and with his unique bravery he helps them escape from the terrible traps in which they have been imprisoned. They have to find a way out of the house before their evil captor returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elves have been taught some magic by their father, and they are able to use this on a key that Robert finds in his pocket, to unlock the front door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are reunited with their father who promised to give Robert a present for having saved his children. Robert gives them the key to his garden shed in case they should ever need refuge above ground.&lt;/p&gt;" />
