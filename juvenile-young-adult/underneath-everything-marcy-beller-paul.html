  <title>Underneath Everything - Marcy Beller Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Underneath Everything&lt;/em&gt; is a seductive, gorgeously written debut about two girls bound by an obsessive and toxic friendship, perfect for fans of Lauren Oliver and Courtney Summers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattie shouldn&#39;t be at the bonfire. She should be finding new maps for her collection, hanging out with Kris, and steering clear of almost everyone else, especially Jolene. After all, Mattie and Kris dropped off the social scene the summer after sophomore year for a reason. But now Mattie is a senior, and she&#39;s sick of missing things. So here she is. And there&#39;s Jolene: Beautiful. Captivating. Just like the stories she wove. Mattie would know&amp;#8212;she used to star in them. She and Jolene were best friends. Mattie has the scar on her palm to prove it, and Jolene has everything else, including Hudson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Mattie runs into Hudson and gets a glimpse of what could have been, she decides to take it all back: the boyfriend, the friends, the life she was supposed to live. Problem is, Mattie can&#39;t figure out where Jolene&#39;s life ends and hers begins. Because there&#39;s something Mattie hasn&#39;t told anyone: She walked away from Jolene over a year ago, but she never really left. &lt;/p&gt;" />
