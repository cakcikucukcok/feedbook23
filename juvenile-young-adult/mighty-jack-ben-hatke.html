  <title>Mighty Jack - Ben Hatke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jack might be the only kid in the world who&#39;s dreading summer. But he&#39;s got a good reason: summer is when his single mom takes a second job and leaves him at home to watch his autistic kid sister, Maddy. It&#39;s a lot of responsibility, and it&#39;s boring, too, because Maddy doesn&#39;t talk. Ever. But then, one day at the flea market, Maddy does talk--to tell Jack to trade their mom&#39;s car for a box of mysterious seeds. It&#39;s the best mistake Jack has ever made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Mighty Jack&lt;/i&gt;, what starts as a normal little garden out back behind the house quickly grows up into a wild, magical jungle with tiny onion babies running amok, huge, pink pumpkins that bite, and, on one moonlit night that changes everything...a dragon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
