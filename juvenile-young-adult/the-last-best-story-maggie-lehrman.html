  <title>The Last Best Story - Maggie Lehrman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A witty, fresh romantic comedy, set on one fateful prom night, about two high-schools seniors who can&amp;#8217;t quite admit they are in love. Think E. Lockhart meets Katie Cotugno.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the end of senior year, and Rose Regnero is over it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#8217;s over chasing stories for a school newspaper no one reads. Over missing out on &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; high school life. And most of all, over Grant Leitch: editor-in-chief, former close friend, never-quite-boyfriend. Now all she wants is a typical prom, complete with handsome date, fancy corsage, and dancing to cheesy pop songs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s the end of senior year, and Grant Leitch is in denial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#8217;s in denial about handing over the reins of the paper to an unworthy underclassman. In denial that Rose suddenly, inexplicably quit the paper and now won&amp;#8217;t talk to him. But mostly he&amp;#8217;s in denial that she is at prom with another guy, and it&amp;#8217;s no one&amp;#8217;s fault but his own. Grant&amp;#8217;s only hope of luring Rose back to him (and the paper) is a juicy story she won&amp;#8217;t be able to resist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end it takes a toga-wearing prom crasher, an emergency lockdown, a secret stalker, and a wild after-party to bring Grant and Rose together for one last story...and one final chance to admit that they&amp;#8217;re made for each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
