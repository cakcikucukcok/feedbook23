  <title>Tiny House, Big Fix - Gail Anderson-Dargatz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sadie works as a framer, building houses. She lost her own home in a recent divorce and now lives with her two daughters in a rented bungalow. When her landlady says she needs to move out, Sadie finds there&#39;s a housing crisis in her community. She can&#39;t find a place to live and is forced to move her family into a travel trailer at a local campsite.
When her ex-husband finds out, he insists that the girls come live with him in another city. Desperate to keep her daughters with her in their home community, Sadie is forced to rethink her dream of living in a full-sized house.
In the short term, she moves her girls into a co-worker&#39;s apartment. Then, with the help of her friends and daughters, she builds a tiny house. In the process she finds living with less has its rewards and that living in a small space brings her family closer together." />
