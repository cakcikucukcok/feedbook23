  <title>The Apprenticeship of Lucas Whitaker - Cynthia DeFelice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Matter of Life or Death&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1849, and twelve-year-old, Lucas Whitaker is all alone after his whole family dies of a disease called consumption which has swept through the community. Lucas is grief-stricken and filled with guilt. He might have saved his mother, who was the last to die, if only he had listened to news of a strange cure for this deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unable to manage the family farm by himself, Lucas finds work as an apprentice to Doc Beecher, doctor, dentist, barber and undertaker. Doc amputates a leg as easily as he pulls a tooth, yet when it comes to consumption, he remains powerless, unwilling to try the cure he calls nonsense. Lucas can&#39;t accept Doc&#39;s disbelief, and he joins others in the dark ritual they believe is their only hope. The startling results teach Lucas a great deal about fear, desperation, and the scientific reasoning that offers hope for a true cure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Apprenticeship of Lucas Whitaker&lt;/i&gt; is a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
