  <title>Dear Sylvia - Alan Cumyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the OLA&#39;s Forest of Reading Silver Birch Express Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sylvia Tull -- the girl whose very glance turns Owen&#39;s face into a burning tomato -- has moved away from the small village where Owen lives with his parents and two brothers. But he still has the birthday gift she gave him -- a stationery set, complete with stamped envelopes -- because she wants him to keep sending her stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Owen nervously begins to write Sylvia about all the things that are going on in his life. How his little brother, Leonard, got his head stuck in the bannister. The disastrous camping trip with his irritating girl cousins. How his new baby cousin will only stop screaming if Owen carries her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And he tells her about the most bewildering drama to hit the Skye household yet, when the boys&#39; father quits his insurance job to write a novel, and all the Skyes have to cope with the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Cumyn has written an irresistible epistolary novel. Owen is a true writer in his head -- but getting the right words onto the page is another story. Young readers will easily identify as he wrestles with his spelling, with his writer&#39;s insecurity, and with his deep desire to tell Sylvia the truth about what is going on in his life, and in his heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
