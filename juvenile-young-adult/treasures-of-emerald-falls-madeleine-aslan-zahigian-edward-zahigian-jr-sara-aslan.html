  <title>Treasures of Emerald Falls - Madeleine Aslan Zahigian, Edward Zahigian Jr., Sara Aslan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emerald Falls is an enchanted Alpine Village, known for its majestic snow capped mountains, towering waterfalls, and natural wonders. Young Madeleine calls it home, and today is her birthday. Even the acrobatic peregrine falcon displays its wonders for Madeleine and her friend Moonlight, as their hot air balloon sails over magical Emerald Falls. While her adventures unfold, she will ride into your hearts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon, Madeleine is riding her dancing horse Aslan, with Moonlight and her party along forested Blue Jay Creek. Suddenly, nature strikes! Aslan leaps with HOOVES pawing the air. Madeleine looses her grip on the reins. Aslan panics! What will she do now? How would this change Madeleines and her beloved horses destiny? After this frightful incident, she will need the love of her family and friends too, like Moonlight, Scorpion ( the wild animal trainer), and the talented comedic violinist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unshakable loyalty between Madeleine and Aslan will not be broken, even after the scary incident in the woods. Madeleine presses on bravely to more adventures, and as excitement builds, even the huge monarch butterflies of Emerald Falls are rooting for the birthday girl and Moonlight. At the end of the day, an astonishing mystery awaits them in the forest!&lt;/p&gt;" />
