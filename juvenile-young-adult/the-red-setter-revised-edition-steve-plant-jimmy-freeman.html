  <title>The Red Setter: revised edition - Steve Plant, Jimmy Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Good news for Dog re-homing Charities. After all costs have been deducted, &amp;nbsp;Copyright holders, Steve Plant and Dana Freeman have agreed to donate the royalties from this edition of The Red Setter to dog re-homing charities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Steve Plant was asked by Dana Freeman if he would complete her late husband&amp;#39;s manuscript which comprised of just 6 chapters and chapter headings, hand written on air mail paper. This is the result. An exciting tale of a young boy&amp;#39;s development as he becomes inseparable from his new found friend, his Dog Red.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jamie hadn&amp;rsquo;t really wanted another dog after the death of his beloved &amp;lsquo;Duke&amp;rsquo;, but his dad and Old Jock, by subterfuge, persuade Jamie to take a greyhound pup born to Jock&amp;rsquo;s red setter, Sheila. Jamie names the pup Red, and after weeks of chasing rabbits in the hills near to home, Jamie realises he has much more than just a pet greyhound. Soon it becomes clear that winning the ultimate prize in greyhound racing, The Greyhound Derby may not be just a dream.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Three less than honest rogues, interested only in making money, also &amp;nbsp;have their eyes set on the ultimate prize and the money jackpot that accompanies it. They are unaware of a link to Jamie&amp;rsquo;s dog, Red.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clever planning ensures that the Jamie&amp;rsquo;s and the brothers&amp;rsquo; dogs run their early races in different parts of the country and never meet in competition.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The race is on. Each of the dogs is very successful, but it is inevitable that they are to meet for the Honour of Winning the Greyhound Derby&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
