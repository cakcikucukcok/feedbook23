  <title>Slugboy Saves the World - Mark Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thanks to an unfortunately tasty-looking radioactive garden slug, eleven-year-old Murdo McLeod is now the world&#39;s worst superhero. His two powers are pretty unique: the first is sliding up walls. Quite slowly. The second is secreting slippery slime from his skin. (Yes, just as disgusting as it sounds.) 
In a world where superhero competition is fierce, Slugboy doesn&#39;t make the grade. No one wants help fighting bad guys from someone with a horrible habit of (quite literally) messing things up. He&#39;s so underrated, in fact, that when an evil mastermind devises a plan to capture all the other superheroes, Slugboy isn&#39;t even on his list. 
Now, Slug Boy has to use his not-so-super and oh-so-gross abilities to free the other superheroes and save the world. Let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t slip up." />
