  <title>BELLEROPHON AND THE CHIMERA - A Greek Children’s Legend - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 349&lt;br /&gt;
In this 349th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Greek Legend &amp;quot;BELLEROPHON and the CHIMERA&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Long before anybody can remember), a fountain gushed out of a hill-side, in the marvelous land of Greece at a place called Pirene.&lt;br /&gt;
A handsome young man named Bellerophon drew near its margin. In his hand he held a bridle, studded with brilliant gems, and adorned with a golden bit. Seeing an old man, and another of middle age, and a little boy, near the fountain, and likewise a maiden, who was dipping up some of the water in a pitcher, he paused, and begged that he might refresh himself with a draught. He drank and thought the water delicious and refreshing.&lt;br /&gt;
An older man asked Bellerophon &amp;ldquo;Have you lost a horse? I see you carry the bridle in your hand; and a very pretty one it is with that double row of bright stones upon it. If the horse was as fine as the bridle, you are much to be pitied for losing him.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I have lost no horse,&amp;quot; said Bellerophon, with a smile. &amp;quot;But I happen to be seeking a very famous one, which, as wise people have informed me, must be found hereabouts, if anywhere. Do you know whether the winged horse Pegasus still haunts the Fountain of Pirene, as he used to do in your forefathers&amp;#39; days?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone laughed and said the horse he seeks had not been seen since before the time of their grandparents. Nevertheless Bellerophon settled down to wait for the Winged Wonder.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Well many things happened, some silly and some serious. How long did Bellerophon have to wait? Did the winged horse Pegasus appear? To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
