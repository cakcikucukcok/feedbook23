  <title>MORE ENGLISH FAIRY TALES - 44 illustrated children&#39;s stories from England - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and Edited by Joseph Jacobs, Illustrated by John D Batten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joseph Jacob&amp;rsquo;s first volume&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;English Fairy&amp;mdash;&lt;/i&gt;did not exhaust the scanty remains of traditional English folktales. He retained those he did not use and most of the 44 illustrated tales that appear in &lt;i&gt;More English Fairy Tales&lt;/i&gt; had never before appeared in print.&lt;br /&gt;
Many of these 44 tales were recorded verbatim from storytellers. Stories like Tattercoats, Yallery Brown, The Three Feathers, Sir Gammer Vans, A Pottle O&amp;#39; Brains, Old Mother Wiggle-Waggle and many, many more. Some will be familiar and others less so, but all are nonetheless captivating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In compiling &lt;i&gt;More English Fairy Tales&lt;/i&gt; Joseph Jacobs flouted the Florklorist&amp;rsquo;s creed, choosing to present stories that would fill children&amp;#39;s imaginations &amp;ldquo;with bright trains of images&amp;rdquo;, vividly painted princesses, Pied Pipers, pots of gold, giants, speaking cats, Kings, Hoybahs, wise men, washerwomen, and more overflow from this volume - all bound by the common threads of basic moral lessons. Academics of the day would say they are by no means in an authorised form, and even use a mix of archaic and colloquial English. Maybe so, but the effect is justified.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the times following Jacob&amp;rsquo;s original printing in 1894, the literary establishment objected to the use of such archaic colloquialisms. However, these tales have been told for generations in a form that used local dialects and colloquial words for effect. This traditional form makes these stories all the richer in a modern setting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We invite you to curl up with this volume and be transported back in time to when England had a hundred or more local dialects&amp;mdash;a time when the words &lt;i&gt;Lawkamercyme&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;noddle&lt;/i&gt; were commonplace.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the publisher&amp;rsquo;s profit from the sale from this book will be donated to Charities.&lt;br /&gt;
