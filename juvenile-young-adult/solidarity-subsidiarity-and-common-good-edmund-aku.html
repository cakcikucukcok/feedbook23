  <title>Solidarity, Subsidiarity and Common Good - Edmund Aku</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a sequel of our first book titled Re-Defining Community published ten years ago by Peter Lang. A good part of this current book is devoted to defining and elaboration on the key concepts, solidarity, subsidiarity and the common good principles. These concepts are essential to the sense of community. The point is that any community is complex and diverse. The only way to ensure harmony in such a setting is to operate in solidarity, a term which entails mutual support and collaboration. The only way this is possible is by respecting everyone involved in the life of the community, and that people are sincere about their strengths and weaknesses." />
