  <title>Echo&#39;s Sister - Paul Mosier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;critically acclaimed author Paul Mosier, a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/em&gt;Flying Start, comes a stunning story about the beauty of family, the power of community, and ultimately the strength of the human spirit.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old El has planned on making her first week at a new school fantastic. She won&amp;#8217;t go by her given name, Laughter. She&amp;#8217;ll sit in the back of the classroom where she can make new friends. She won&amp;#8217;t even have time to think about all the fun her old friends are having without her. Everything will be great.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when her dad picks her up after school and tells her that her younger sister, Echo, has a life-threatening illness, her world is suddenly turned upside down. And with her parents now pressed for time and money, El feels lost and powerless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she befriends Octavius, the only other kid in school who gets what she&amp;#8217;s going through. As El begins to adjust to her new life, she soon finds that maybe a little hope and a lot of love can overcome any obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
