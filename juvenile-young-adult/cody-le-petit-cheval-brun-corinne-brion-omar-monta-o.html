  <title>Cody Le Petit Cheval Brun - Corinne Brion, Omar Montaño</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of Cody, Le Petit Cheval Brun, came about when I was teaching French to Fourth graders. I was in need of a reader for the class but was not able to find anything that appropriately matched my curriculum. It is then that I decided to tell the students about Cody, my little brown horse. The class not only truly enjoyed the story but they were impressed by the illustrations as well (the illustrations were done by Omar Montao, my husband). 
I am excited to share this easy to read book. The book can be used by teachers in France as well as Teachers of French as a Second Language around the world. Its audience is for young native French speakers aged 1-5 and for French Language Learners aged 7-10.
I am thrilled to contribute to the improvement of children&#39;s reading skills and enhancement of their global education. I wish all children had access to learning a second language. I am hoping that this book will contribute to that wish. Omar and I would love to publish more books about Cody and our dogs in French, Spanish and English. 
In the event that we gain profits from the book sales, I will use the profits to help fund the development of k-12 schools in sub-Saharan French speaking countries.
Enjoy! Bonne lecture!
Merci beaucoup!
Corinne, Omar and Cody" />
