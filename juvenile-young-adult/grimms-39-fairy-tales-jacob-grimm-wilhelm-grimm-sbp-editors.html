  <title>Grimms&#39; Fairy Tales - Jacob Grimm, Wilhelm Grimm, Sbp Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For most children, reading the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm is an essential experience when growing up. Grimm&amp;#39;s Fairy Tales collects fifty-five of the best-known fairy and folk tales set down by the Brothers Grimm, including &amp;#39;Sleeping Beauty,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Little Red Riding Hood,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Hansel and Gretel,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;The Frog-Prince,&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;Rumpelstiltskin&amp;#39;.&amp;nbsp;The Brothers Grimm rediscovered a host of fairy tales, telling of princes and princesses in their castles, witches in their towers and forests, of giants and dwarfs, of fabulous animals and dark deeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brothers Grimm, &lt;strong&gt;Jacob&lt;/strong&gt; (1785-1863) and &lt;strong&gt;Wilhelm&lt;/strong&gt; (1786-1859), were born in Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout their lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg University. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology, and although Wilhelm&amp;rsquo;s work was hampered by poor health the brothers collaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until a century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known for the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral sources and published in two volumes of &amp;lsquo;Nursery and Household Tales&amp;rsquo; in 1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as part of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was first published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon came into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar Taylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about fifty stories &amp;lsquo;with the amusement of some young friends principally in view.&amp;rsquo; They have been an essential ingredient of children&amp;rsquo;s reading ever since.&lt;/p&gt;" />
