  <title>THE STORY OF THE HERO MAKOMA - An African Tale from Across the Zambesi - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 368&lt;br /&gt;
In this 368th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Fairy Tale &amp;quot;THE STORY OF THE HERO MAKOMA&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, long, long ago and far, far away, in the town of Senna on the banks of the Zambesi, A great river in Africa, was born a child. He was not like other children, for he was very tall and strong; over his shoulder he carried a big sack, and in his hand an iron hammer. He could also speak like a grown man, but usually he was very silent.&lt;br /&gt;
One day his mother said to him: &amp;lsquo;My child, by what name shall we know you?&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
And he answered: &amp;lsquo;Call all the head men of Senna here to the river&amp;rsquo;s bank.&amp;rsquo; And his mother called the head men of the town, and when they had come he led them down to a deep black pool in the river where all the fierce crocodiles lived.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;O great men!&amp;rsquo; he said, while they all listened, &amp;lsquo;which of you will leap into the pool and overcome the crocodiles?&amp;rsquo; But no one would come forward. So he turned and sprang into the water and disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;
The people held their breath, for they thought: &amp;lsquo;Surely the boy is bewitched and throws away his life, for the crocodiles will eat him!&amp;rsquo; Then suddenly the ground trembled, and the pool, heaving and swirling, became red with blood, and presently the boy rose to the surface and swam to the shore.&lt;br /&gt;
But he was no longer just a boy! He was stronger than any man and very tall and handsome, so that the people shouted with gladness when they saw him.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;lsquo;Now, O my people!&amp;rsquo; he cried waving his hand, &amp;lsquo;you know my name&amp;mdash;I am Mak&amp;oacute;ma, &amp;ldquo;the Greater&amp;rdquo;; for I have slain the crocodiles in the pool where none would venture?&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Then he said to his mother: &amp;lsquo;Rest gently, my mother, for I go to make a home for myself and become a hero.&amp;rsquo; Then, entering his hut, he took Nu-&amp;eacute;ndo, his iron hammer, and throwing the sack over his shoulder, he went away.&lt;br /&gt;
Mak&amp;oacute;ma crossed the Zambesi, and for many moons he wandered towards the north and west......&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Where did Makoma go? What adventures did he have and did he become the Great Makoma? Well many things happened, some strange, some silly and some serious. To find the answers to these questions, and others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
