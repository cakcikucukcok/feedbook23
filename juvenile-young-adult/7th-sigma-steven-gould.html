  <title>7th Sigma - Steven Gould</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the territory. Leave your metal behind, all of it. The bugs will eat it, and they&#39;ll go right through you to get it...Don&#39;t carry it, don&#39;t wear it, and for god&#39;s sake don&#39;t come here if you&#39;ve got a pacemaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bugs showed up about fifty years ago--self-replicating, solar-powered, metal-eating machines. No one knows where they came from. They don&#39;t like water, though, so they&#39;ve stayed in the desert Southwest. The territory. People still live here, but they do it without metal. Log cabins, ceramics, what plastic they can get that will survive the sun and heat. Technology has adapted, and so have the people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kimble Monroe has chosen to live in the territory. He was born here, and he is extraordinarily well adapted to it. He&#39;s one in a million. Maybe one in a billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;7th Sigma, &lt;/i&gt;Gould builds an extraordinary SF novel of survival and personal triumph against all the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
