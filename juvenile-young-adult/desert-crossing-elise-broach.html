  <title>Desert Crossing - Elise Broach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There are some kinds of trouble you never see coming, like those thunderstorms that start from nothing at all. One minute the sky is bright blue and distant. Then, all of a sudden, it&#39;s dark and thick with clouds, pressing down right on top of you. The leaves turn silvery and twist in the wind, the air starts to hum, and the rain comes, so heavy and fast you can&#39;t even see. You almost never make it to the house on time.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A dead body on the road--who is responsible and how will it affect the lives of three teens?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fourteen-year-old Lucy Martinez, the moment when everything changes comes one night during a long car trip with her older brother and his friend Kit. They are on their way to visit Lucy&#39;s father for spring break, but never make it. While driving across northern New Mexico through a blinding rainstorm, their car hits something--an animal, they think. But when they backtrack, they find a dead body on the side of the road. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With amazing insight and compelling prose, Elise Broach charts a suspenseful journey full of danger, loss, and painful self-discovery. What will happen to the lives of three teenagers who can suddenly no longer pretend innocence?&lt;/p&gt;" />
