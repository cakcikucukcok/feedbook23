  <title>Flight Season - Marie Marquardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Marie Marquardt, the author of &lt;i&gt;Dream Things True&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Radius of Us&lt;/i&gt;, comes a story of two teenagers learning what to hold on to, what to let go of, and that sometimes love gets in the way of our plans.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back when they were still strangers, TJ Carvalho witnessed the only moment in Vivi Flannigan&#39;s life when she lost control entirely. Now, TJ can&#39;t seem to erase that moment from his mind, no matter how hard he tries. Vivi doesn&#39;t remember any of it, but she&#39;s determined to leave it far behind. And she will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Vivi returns home from her first year away at college, her big plans and TJ&#39;s ambition to become a nurse land them both on the heart ward of a university hospital, facing them with a long and painful summer together - three months of glorified babysitting for Ángel, the problem patient on the hall. Sure, Ángel may be suffering from a life-threatening heart infection, but that doesn&#39;t make him any less of a pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, though, Ángel Solís has a thing or two to teach them about all those big plans, and the incredible moments when love gets in their way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in alternating first person from the perspectives of all three characters, &lt;i&gt;Flight Season &lt;/i&gt;is a story about discovering what&#39;s really worth holding onto, learning how to let go of the rest, and that one crazy summer that changes your life forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
