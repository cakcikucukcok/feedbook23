  <title>This Is All Your Fault, Cassie Parker - Terra Elan McVoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this heartwarming companion to &lt;em&gt;Drive Me Crazy&lt;/em&gt;, twelve-year-old Fiona Coppleton is living a middle schooler&amp;#8217;s worst nightmare: her diary was made public and her best friend is partly to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fiona and Cassie are supposed to be best friends forever. No one else listens or makes Fiona laugh like Cassie, and that meant everything when Fiona&amp;#8217;s parents were divorcing. They love each other in spite of their (many) differences, and even though Cassie cares a little too much about being popular, Fiona can&amp;#8217;t imagine life without her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until Fiona&amp;#8217;s diary is stolen by the most popular girls at school, and her most secret thoughts are &lt;em&gt;read out loud on the bus.&lt;/em&gt; Even worse: Cassie was there, and she didn&amp;#8217;t do anything to stop it. Now, for some reason, she&amp;#8217;s ignoring Fiona. Suddenly the whole world has shifted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life without a best friend is confusing, scary, maybe impossible. But as Fiona navigates a summer of big changes, she learns more about herself&amp;#8212;and friendship&amp;#8212;than she ever thought possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
