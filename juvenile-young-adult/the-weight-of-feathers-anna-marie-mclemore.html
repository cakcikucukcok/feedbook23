  <title>The Weight of Feathers - Anna-Marie McLemore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For twenty years, the Palomas and the Corbeaus have been rivals and enemies, locked in an escalating feud for over a generation. Both families make their living as traveling performers in competing shows-the Palomas swimming in mermaid exhibitions, the Corbeaus, former tightrope walkers, performing in the tallest trees they can find. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lace Paloma may be new to her family&#39;s show, but she knows as well as anyone that the Corbeaus are pure &lt;i&gt;magia &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;negra,&lt;/i&gt; black magic from the devil himself. Simply touching one could mean death, and she&#39;s been taught from birth to keep away. But when disaster strikes the small town where both families are performing, it&#39;s a Corbeau boy, Cluck, who saves Lace&#39;s life. And his touch immerses her in the world of the Corbeaus, where falling for him could turn his own family against him, and one misstep can be just as dangerous on the ground as it is in the trees. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautifully written, and richly imaginative, Anna-Marie McLemore&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Weight of Feathers&lt;/i&gt; is an utterly captivating young adult novel by a talented new voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
