  <title>Bishops - Michael Keulemans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There has been no serious study of Anglican bishops since Kenneth Kirk published Apostolic Ministry in 1946.  This new book goes straight back to the New Testament and the Early Church to discover the little-known origins of episcopal ministry and how it came to Britain through the efforts of first the Celtic and then the Roman Church.  Increasing politicisation by William the Conqueror and his successors is examined in depth, as is Cranmer&#39;s rediscovery of its essentially teaching and pastoral functions of the episcopate at the Reformation.  
   Lancelot Andrewes&#39;s career is spotlighted to find the true qualities of the classic 17th century Anglican bishop before he declined into the political hack and social climber of the 18th century.  A chapter on the 19th century shows how Queen Victoria, her entourage, her Prime Ministers and her Archbishops of Canterbury all played lively parts in the appointment of new bishops, with considerable tussles frequently occurring between them.  The history can be truly absorbing!
    A  statistical analysis reveals how the English episcopate has changed in the century between 1905 and 2005,  noting that while the educational backgrounds of bishops have not altered greatly, with Oxbridge still a major influence, their social backgrounds and ecclesiastical careers now tend to follow a different path.  Has this produced a better episcopate?
   The episcopal histories of the Church in Wales and the Scottish Episcopal Church get a chapter each, which include a close-up of their contrasting methods for appointing bishops and the resulting difference in atmosphere between these two bodies.  The Scottish chapter shows how the Episcopalians&#39; democratic electoral system travelled to the USA at the end of the 18th century and subsequently influenced the episcopal organisation of nearly all newer branches of the Anglican Communion.
   A chapter on changing thinking about episcopacy in the Church of England and elsewhere reveals several trends, including moves towards collegial decision-making and a decline in emphasis upon the teaching and pastoral functions.  There is also a review of the growing phenomenon of extra-mural Anglicanism brought into being in the aftermath of ordaining women priests and adopting a less rigorous attitude towards marriage and other sexual matters.
   The results of a major statistical survey on the attitudes of clergy and laity and recently retired bishops towards the episcopate and its responsibilities are presented in detail.  The dioceses surveyed were Bradford, Leicester, Monmouth and Edinburgh.  These results highlight the huge pressures and varied calls upon a bishop&#39;s time, including his relationship with his parishes, attendance at the House of Lords, diocesan administration and clergy discipline.   Are bishops on a hiding to nowhere?
   The final chapter expands upon the lessons to be learnt from both the historical analysis and the results of the statistical survey, asking whether the existing episcopate is adequate to face the challenges of today and tomorrow.  Practical solutions are offered, which will stimulate action to promote the faith of Christ in an increasingly difficult religious, political, social and economic environment.  A suggestion is also made to help create a Church where both those for and against women priests can co-exist and flourish in their work without either side suffering offence or marginalisation.
   Unfortunately bishops are an embarrassing subject for clergy and laity to discuss, which is why they have been so little researched and so infrequently written about.  They are important people and wield great power.   For their own sakes and for the sake of the Church their role must be discussed sympathetically but realistically.  This important book should help start the process." />
