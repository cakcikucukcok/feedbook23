  <title>Before We Were Black - Eric A. McMiller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book adds the missing pages of history and restores the original first family to their rightful place by weaving together discoveries from the past thirty years with common knowledge about Africans and their descendants into a complete story. Written in the twenty-first century, this book is the first of its kind that asks its reader to think outside the box. The author takes on the challenge presented to Americans by Senator Barack Obama during his speech in Philadelphia on March 2008 when he addressed the issue of race relations in America. 
	Before We Were Black looks at old history from a different angle with a fresh pair of eyes. The reader will be asked to participate and take a ride with the author; suspend some of their own preconceived notions; and for the moment, look through the lens of the twenty-first century. The purpose of this book is not to accuse but to take a judicial approach where the facts complete the story. 
	Before We Were Black does not bog its reader down with demagoguery. Instead, the reader will feel like they are on an amusement park ridesometimes flying so high that it takes their breath away and other times falling so low that it brings them to tears; but when the reader has finished the book, they will look back and say, I want to read it again!
	A book of this kind comes along once every twenty years. Its a book rendered in the same genre as Why We Cant Wait by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; As a Man Thinketh by James Allen; The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin; and The Greatest Salesman in the World by Og Mandino. All relatively small books, yet they leave their reader with a life-long impression. This book is for everyone, young and old, and is a catalyst to the nations ongoing discussion about race relations. The time has come for a new model on race relations. Finally, the full story about world history is presentedare you ready?" />
