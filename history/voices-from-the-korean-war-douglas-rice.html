  <title>Voices from the Korean War - Douglas Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Voices from the Korean War&lt;/i&gt; presents a collection of first-person accounts of those who served in the Korean War.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Korean War is often dubbed the Forgotten War, although more than 36,000 soldiers died in this three-year conflict. In &lt;i&gt;Voices from the Korean War,&lt;/i&gt; author Douglas Rice makes certain the men who served are not forgotten as he shares first-person accounts from &lt;i&gt;seventy-nine&lt;/i&gt; soldiers who fought in the war from June of 1950 through July of 1953.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Voices from the Korean War&lt;/i&gt; follows the soldiers as they trek and fly over the mountainous terrain of the Korean peninsula. Through these eyewitness accounts, hear a soldier describe what happened to a small group of North Korean villagers who refused to divulge their location. Listen in as a wounded soldier tells a flight nurse the story of how he was rescued by American soldiers as he lay wounded in a North Korean home. Learn how some prisoners of war walked their imaginary dogs to irritate their captors.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This compilation of different soldiers perspectives conveys what it must have been like to be directly involved in the conflict. It serves as a reminder of the challenges and the sacrifices the soldiers made in the name of war.&lt;/p&gt;" />
