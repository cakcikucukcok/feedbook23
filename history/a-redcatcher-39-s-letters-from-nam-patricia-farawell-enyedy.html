  <title>A Redcatcher&#39;s Letters from Nam - Patricia Farawell Enyedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This sentimental book is a diary of a brother sent to Vietnam in 1968. Book 2 includes the first book &quot;A Redcatcher&#39;s Letters from Nam&quot; with the letters George wrote home along with the journey it sent his sister, Patricia, the author on for the next 45 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gold Star Sister she was embraced by her brother&#39;s unit the Redcatchers. Many vets&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;shared their memories with her over the years and are included. Special articles written by Robert Fromme he wrote later in life are included.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my children, grandchildren and family to remember a real Hero in their family who&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;was a fine athlete, good friend, loving son and brother. For my mom who lived to be 100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;years old she quietly missed her boy for 45 years.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For old friends who still remember their friend from childhood wrote wonderful heartfelt stories are included. So many still asking about the first book for their kids and&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;grandkids.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully leaving a small legacy for the young people of today to know the Vietnam War through the words and tears of a small town boy who was called to duty in 1968.&lt;/p&gt;" />
