      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;Visit these links: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bixandbones.com/ &quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.bixandbones.com/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lookpokergame.com/&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.lookpokergame.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This novel is based on a rumor.   The author was among the very first combat officers to arrive on the island of Kyushu, one of the islands of Japan, immediately following the signing of the peace aboard the USS Missouri on 9/3/45.  The Japanese civilians had been propagandized for years what monsters Americans were.  This story went around the Air Base about a very innocent pilot  too young to get a drivers license back home  in a poker game had won a Geisha House.  If, indeed, he were to fall in love with one of the adorable, feminine young ladies, trained to tend to a mans every wish, what effect that would have on him  which, in turn, would have influence on her.  Also, what would the officers in that command do about all this  an American officer owning a geisha house?   Add to that, the Stateside Commanders, officers who spent the whole war in the Training Command back home, who were sent overseas to relieve men with combat points, who were ready to get back home.  Also, add to relaxed, free-wheeling combat troops, these spit &amp; polish commanders who wanted to run their new commands by the book.  This story is all about 
mixing those two sets of complete opposites and this is one result." />
