  <title>Nazareth Gospel Sites - Trevor Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“This book’s relating of the biblical accounts to the sites of Nazareth that we know today is a welcome contribution.” ~ Ray Pritz Ph.D, former Director, Biblical Society in Israel
Although the centre of modern Nazareth has no archaeological evidence of a city in the time of Jesus, the Catholic Church of the Annunciation is the most likely location for the encounter of the Virgin Mary with the angel Gabriel. Furthermore, verifiable remains of a large Jewish city in 4 BC have been discovered in Nazareth’s outer suburbs at Yafia. The mystery of Nazareth involving these two localities can now be explained. 
This guide book provides: 
• An up-to-date guide to the key sites of Jesus in his hometown. 
• An easy to follow sequence for visitors, tourists and pilgrims to Nazareth. 
• A resource and devotional guide to sites mentioned in the New Testament Gospels. 
INCLUDED IN THIS BOOK 
• The latest archaeological evidence revealing the layout of Nazareth and its description at the time of Mary and Joseph. 
• The location of the incarnation and family home of Jesus. 
• The two workshops of Saint Joseph and their significance. 
• A proposal where Jesus made his prophetic declaration as the Messiah in the Nazareth Synagogue on the Day of Atonement in a Jubilee year. 
• A ‘stoning place’ locality where city leaders tried to execute Jesus. 
• Information on several prophetic sites that reveal Jesus as the Messiah." />
