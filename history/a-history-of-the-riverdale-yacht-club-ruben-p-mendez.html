  <title>A History of the Riverdale Yacht Club - Ruben P. Mendez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Riverdale Yacht Club is a small private association on the shoreline
of the Hudson River in the Riverdale section of New York Citys borough
of The Bronx. While author Ruben Mendez furnishes a chronicle of
the institution, he also discloses valuable historical information about
Riverdale, the Hudson River, the building of what is today the
Metro-North railroads Hudson Division, and the creation of the New
York-New Jersey Palisades into an interstate park.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Founded in 1931, the yacht clubs first decade coincided with the
Great Depression. During World War II, over sixty of its members
served in the military.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Mendez not only describes the sports and other activities that occurred
on the clubs ground, he also provides thumbnail sketches of some
noted members. They include Nobel Prize laureates; professors, deans
and presidents of institutions of higher education; journalists; authors;
diplomats; medical doctors; lawyers; and other figures of historical
importance. Thus he has produced a work recounting a little-known,
but essential part of the history of The Bronx and of New York City.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
