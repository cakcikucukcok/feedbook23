  <title>The Effectiveness of Airpower in the 20&lt;Sup&gt;Th&lt;/Sup&gt; Century - Capt. John O&#39;Connell Usn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book reviews the actual effectiveness of military air power in accomplishing desired military and political goals in a number of conflicts following WWII.&lt;p&gt;
During the Korean War and the Vietnam War, U.S. air power attempted a re-run of WWII aerial activities.  However, in both conflicts, political constraints prevented the United States from achieving its desired political results, although the 1972 B-52 strategic bombing campaign against Hanoi worked to bring the North Vietnamese back to the negotiating table.&lt;p&gt;
The Falklands/Malvinas War pitted the UK against Argentina in a remote corner of the South Atlantic.  Air power allowed a U.K victory, barely.&lt;p&gt;
The USSR held air supremacy over Afghanistan but was unable to subdue tough Afghan guerrillas, and was finally forced to withdraw after Stinger missiles were introduced.&lt;p&gt;
The Gulf War demonstrated the increasing effectiveness of precision aerial weaponry. The conflict in Kosovo finally produced a result long sought by air power enthusiasts-an end to fighting brought about by air attack alone." />
