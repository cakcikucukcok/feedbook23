  <title>Religious Rivalries and the Struggle for Success in Caesarea Maritima - Terence L. Donaldson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; We know how the story of the Roman Empire ended with the &quot;triumph&quot; of Christianity and the eventual Christianization of the Roman Mediterranean. But how would religious life have appeared to an observer at a time when the conversion of the emperor was only a Christian pipe dream? And how would it have appeared in one particular city, rather than in the Roman Empire as a whole? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; This volume takes a detailed look at the religious dimension of life in one particular Roman city Caesarea Maritima, on the Mediterranean coast of Judea. Caesarea was marked by a complex religious identity from the outset. Over time, other religious groups, including Christianity, Mithraism and Samaritanism, found a home in the city, where they jostled with each other, and with those already present, for position, influence and the means of survival. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Written by a team of seasoned scholars and promising newcomers, this book brings a new perspective to the study of religion in antiquity. Along with the deliberate goal to understand religion as an urban phenomenon, &lt;i&gt;Religious Rivalries and the Struggle for Success in Caesarea Maritima&lt;/i&gt; studies religious groups as part of the dynamic process of social interaction, spanning a spectrum from coexistence, through competition and rivalry, to open conflict. The cumulative result is a fresh and fascinating look at one of antiquity’s most interesting cities. &lt;/p&gt;" />
