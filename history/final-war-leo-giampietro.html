  <title>Final War - Leo Giampietro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the end there will be many wars; this will be one of the signs that the end is near. In Matthew 24:7-8, Jesus Christ foretold signs that would mark the time leading up to His return: &quot;For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places &quot;
We have certainly seen devastating earthquakes in recent years. The December 2004 earthquake off Indonesia was the most powerful in decades, unleashing a massive tsunami that took some 300,000 lives. Less than a year later, an earthquake in southern Asia killed another 30,000.
In Matthew 24:7, the Greek word translated &quot;earthquakes&quot; is seismos, from which we derive such English words as &quot;seismology,&quot; referring to the study of earthquakes. Strong&#39;s Lexicon defines it as &quot;a commotion, i.e. (of the air) a gale, (of the ground) an earthquakeearthquake, tempest. Seismos has a broader meaning than just the earth shaking.
Matthew 8 records how a violent storm overtook Jesus and His disciples on the Sea of Galilee, threatening to capsize their boat and drown themuntil Jesus miraculously calmed the winds and waves." />
