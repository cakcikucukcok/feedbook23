  <title>I&#39;m Staying with My Boys - Jim Proser, Jerry Cutter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m Staying with My Boys&lt;/i&gt; is a firsthand look inside the life of one of the greatest heroes of the Greatest Generation. Sgt. John Basilone held off 3,000 Japanese troops at Guadalcanal after his 15-member unit was reduced to three men. At Iwo Jima he single-handedly destroyed an enemy blockhouse, allowing his unit to capture an airfield. Minutes later he was killed by an enemy artillery round. He was the only Marine in World War II to have received the Medal of Honor, the Navy Cross, and a Purple Heart and is arguably the most famous Marine of all time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I&#39;m Staying with My Boys&lt;/i&gt; is the only family-authorized biography of Basilone, and it features photographs never before published. Distinctive among military biographies, the story is told in first person, allowing readers to experience his transformation, forged in the horrors of battle, from aimless youth to war hero known as &quot;Manila John&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
