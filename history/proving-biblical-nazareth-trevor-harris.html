  <title>Proving Biblical Nazareth - Trevor Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“This book provides challenging material that requires a re-think on the understanding of traditional Nazareth. The historical analysis has good correlation to biblical time frames.”
Dr. Murray Adamthwaite, Historian, Theologian, Linguist.
• The centre of modern Nazareth has no archaeological evidence of a city in the time of Jesus. However, verifiable remains of a large Jewish city in his time frame have been discovered in Nazareth’s outer suburbs. 
• Intriguing information supporting the traditional Catholic Church of the Annunciation. The site of the visit of the angel Gabriel to the Virgin Mary. 
• Documentation that refutes the claims by atheist scholars that Nazareth was an invented city and the title “Jesus of Nazareth” had no substance. 
• A proposed plan and locality of the Nazareth synagogue where Jesus made his dramatic declaration of the Gospel of Liberty. 
• Demonstrates that biblical geography in the Galilee is compatible with Jewish historian Josephus’ site descriptions with amazing implications. 
INCLUDED IN THIS BOOK 
• A description of the first Church in Nazareth founded by Jesus’ relatives. 
• A proposal for Cana of Galilee where Jesus turned water into wine. 
• The locality on Mount Tabor where a radiant Jesus met Moses and Elijah. 
• Joshua’s Mt. Ebal altar site and its prophetic connection to Nazareth. 
• Detailed maps illustrating God’s divine planning." />
