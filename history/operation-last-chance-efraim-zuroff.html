  <title>Operation Last Chance - Efraim Zuroff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sixty years after the end of World War II, not all those who were faithful to the Third Reich are dead--some members of the Nazi party and their collaborators are still alive, and increasingly difficult to track down. Time is rapidly running out, but Efraim Zuroff won&#39;t give up. Launching Operation Last Chance in 2002, he spearheaded a vast public campaign to locate and bring to justice the worst suspected Nazi criminals before ill health or death spare them from potential punishment. Despite the passage of many years, the reluctance of many governments to cooperate, and even death threats and a price on his head, Zuroff&#39;s project yielded the names of over 520 hereto unknown suspects in 24 different countries and led to dozens of murder investigations, as well as several indictments and extradition requests currently pending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the thrill of a detective story with the inherent poignancy of the history of World War II and its aftermath, &lt;i&gt;Operation Last Chance&lt;/i&gt; delivers the important and moving story of one man&#39;s heroic efforts to honor the victims of the Holocaust.&lt;/p&gt;" />
