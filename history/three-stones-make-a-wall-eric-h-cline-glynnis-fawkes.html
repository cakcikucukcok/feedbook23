  <title>Three Stones Make a Wall - Eric H. Cline, Glynnis Fawkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1922, Howard Carter peered into Tutankhamun&#39;s tomb for the first time, the only light coming from the candle in his outstretched hand. Urged to tell what he was seeing through the small opening he had cut in the door to the tomb, the Egyptologist famously replied, &quot;I see wonderful things.&quot; Carter&#39;s fabulous discovery is just one of the many spellbinding stories told in &lt;i&gt;Three Stones Make a Wall&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by Eric Cline, an archaeologist with more than thirty seasons of excavation experience, &lt;i&gt;Three Stones Make a Wall&lt;/i&gt; traces the history of archaeology from an amateur pursuit to the cutting-edge science it is today by taking the reader on a tour of major archaeological sites and discoveries, from Pompeii to Petra, Troy to the Terracotta Warriors, and Mycenae to Megiddo and Masada. Cline brings to life the personalities behind these digs, including Heinrich Schliemann, the former businessman who excavated Troy, and Mary Leakey, whose discoveries advanced our understanding of human origins. The discovery of the peoples and civilizations of the past is presented in vivid detail, from the Hittites and Minoans to the Inca, Aztec, and Moche. Along the way, the book addresses the questions archaeologists are asked most often: How do you know where to dig? How are excavations actually done? How do you know how old something is? Who gets to keep what is found?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking readers from the pioneering digs of the eighteenth century to the exciting new discoveries being made today, &lt;i&gt;Three Stones Make a Wall&lt;/i&gt; is a lively and essential introduction to the story of archaeology.&lt;/p&gt;" />
