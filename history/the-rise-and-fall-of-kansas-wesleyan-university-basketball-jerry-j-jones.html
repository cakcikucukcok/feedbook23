  <title>The Rise and Fall of Kansas Wesleyan University Basketball - Jerry J. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One hundred and sixteen years have passed since Kansas Wesleyan University (KWU) formed basketball teams known as the Wesleyans, the Methodists, the Preachers, and now, the Coyotes. Fathers, sons, and grandsons have worn the purple and gold colors, winning and losing but always striving to represent the university in a most positive manner. Head coaches had been students, middle school, high school, and college teachers. Like the players themselves, the coaches had come from different states, scattered in all directions. But they were here in Salina back in 1901 and continuing on in 2017 as teammates and brothers of the basketball, bound together by the mutual story that is Kansas Wesleyan basketball." />
