  <title>Jasper County - Cortez Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This unforgettable volume combines the two novels written by
Cortez Robinson. Enjoy your travels with me, as we journey back to a turbulent period of American History.                                   
                                   Jasper County
                                  Part One &amp; Two     
           Jasper County breaks the stereotype of the Civil War era with an array of men and women who have much to lose and much to gain in the beloved red soil of Georgia. But their common love of the land and hatred of Yankees cant bridge differences born of class, money, and race.
Jasper is home to plantation owner Frank Arlington who has a benevolent attitude towards his slaves, partly because he secretly loves Sara Brown, his house servant. His nemesis, James Fallen, is a bigoted small town lawyer, ever resentful of Arlingtons chronic disrespect. 
When Arlington gives 40 acres of prime bottomland to George Brown, his illegitimate son by Sara, the local farmers are enraged.
Fallen, courts their anger through the White Knights, a secret society that helps citizens, when the law wont.
And that is just the beginning. Murder, a savage war, and a fractured family at Arlington plantation ensue. The civil war is a tempest that ignites the best and worst in all characters
