  <title>Manifest Destinies - Laura E. Gómez</title>

G&amp;#243;mez explores the central paradox of Mexican American racial status as entailing the law&#39;s designation of Mexican Americans as &amp;#&amp;#8220;white&amp;#8221; and their simultaneous social position as non-white in American society. She tells a neglected story of conflict, conquest, cooperation, and competition among Mexicans, Indians, and Euro-Americans, the region&amp;#8217;s three main populations who were the key architects and victims of the laws that dictated what one&amp;#8217;s race was and how people would be treated by the law according to one&amp;#8217;s race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;G&amp;#243;mez&amp;#8217;s path breaking work&amp;#8212;spanning the disciplines of law, history, and sociology&amp;#8212;reveals how the construction of Mexicans as an American racial group proved central to the larger process of restructuring the American racial order from the Mexican War (1846&amp;#8211;48) to the early twentieth century. The emphasis on white-over-black relations during this period has obscured the significant role played by the doctrine of Manifest Destiny and the colonization of northern Mexico in the racial subordination of black Americans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
