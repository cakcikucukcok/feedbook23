  <title>Afghanistan’S Experiences - Hamid Hadi M.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan&#39;s Experiences is a sweeping analysis of the historic events and interplay between politics, religion, and terrorism in Afghanistan, the southeastern region of the country, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author has vividly explained the origin and the rise of Taliban to powerone of the most important sources of turmoil in contemporary time. Thus, one can perceive how the dynamics of the sinister politics, religious extremism, and terrorism has culminated in avoidable brutal wars and human tragedies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hamid Hadi has vividly described and put into political debate Afghanistan&#39;s history, the implications of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, the Americans, the Pakistanis&#39; and Saudis&#39; role in the civil war, and the creation of the Al-Qaeda that led to the 9/11 tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a unique research and analysis, the author has examined the acts of Islamic terrorists against the American people and institutions during the last 176 years and brilliantly deduced that Russian invasion of Afghanistan was a watershed era in formation of the contemporary terrorism, and the failure of both superpowers&#39; foreign policy in Afghanistan to a great extent has resulted in growth of the terror network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides detailed description of the 9/11 tragedy and Iraq war, Hamid Hadi has painstakingly brought the world religions and Abrahamic religions in particular into debate and discussed the reform of the Islamic faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
