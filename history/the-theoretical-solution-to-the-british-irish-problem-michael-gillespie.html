  <title>The Theoretical Solution to the British/Irish Problem - Michael Gillespie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This New book offers prescription to cure British-Irish conflict
Michael Gillespies thesis offers both an examination and corrective actions
DERRY/LONDONDERRY, Northern Ireland  Historians have a severe drawback in that they describe but dont prescribe, says author Michael Gillespie. They can describe events and problems but are lax in prescribing remedies for these. Gillespie does more in his new book The Theoretical Solution to the British/Irish Problem Using The General Theory of a Federal Kingdom clearly stated and fully discussed in this Thesis (published by AuthorHouse), which examines the perennial points of conflict between Britain and Ireland.
It is the purpose of Gillespies book to revive the concept of a federal kingdom in Ireland as a solution to the British/Irish problem. The kingdom was federal before the Acts of Union in 1707 and 1801. According to the author, the Act of Union which established the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was an attempt to devise a unitary state for the British Isles in which those islands were ruled directly from Westminster in London and the inhabitants of Ireland were British. This failed dismally and was resisted by federalists in Ireland throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. 
There is no simple solution to the British/Irish problem and half-measures of the Good Friday and St Andrews agreements at Stormont will fail. The coalition at Stormont of loyalists and Republicans is a constitutional obsenity Gillespie says. You are urged therefore to read this book in full to gain a valuable insight into the complexities of the nuts and bolts of this historic problem and find in the National Government of Ireland Act an approach that can be built in bricks and mortar in Ireland if the will of compromise among politicians and the people can be found to do it." />
