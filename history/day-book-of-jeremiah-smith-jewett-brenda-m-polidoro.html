  <title>Day Book of Jeremiah Smith Jewett - Brenda M. Polidoro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Day Book of Jeremiah Smith Jewett
Volume One
January 1, 1854  December 31, 1869
Jeremiah Jewett s impact on NH history and the Lakes Region was unknown until the recent discovery of his numerous, daily, handwritten journals, painstakingly recorded from 1854 unti l 1900.
His life in Warren and Lakeport/Laconia, NH found him wearing
many hats: husband, father, preacher, lawyer, railroad surveyor, merchant,undertaker and gentleman farmer. His vivid descripti ons of his life over 46 years and travels around the country at World Industrial Fairs, Methodist religious gatherings and railway excursions in NH, New England and beyond, are embellished by his emoti onal, notable accounts of the death of Abraham Lincoln, unknown medical diseases of the era, and the tragic loss of a beloved
son at age 19.
Probably no one impacted the towns of Warren, Lakeport (Meredith
Bridge) and Laconia, NH like Rev. Jeremiah S. Jewett . These volumes relate to
his daily experiences in the latt er years of his life.
Brenda M. Polidoro, editor, brings his history of NH to life, in his
own words and style, penned in bound leather. The authenti c transcribed
volumes are a riveti ng account of someti mes tragic and yet hopeful, positi ve
ti mes as seen by one person at the turn of the century." />
