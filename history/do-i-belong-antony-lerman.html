  <title>Do I Belong? - Antony Lerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Belonging&#39; is both a fundamental human emotion and a political project that affects millions. Since its foundation in 1957, the European Union has encouraged people across its member states to feel a sense of belonging to one united community, with mixed results. Today, faced with the fracturing impacts of the migration crisis, the threat of terrorism and rising tensions within countries, governments within and outside the EU seek to impose a different kind of belonging on their populations through policies of exclusion and bordering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this collection of original essays, a diverse group of novelists, journalists and academics reflect on their own individual senses of European belonging. In creative and disarming ways, they confront the challenges of nationalism, populism, racism and fundamentalism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do I Belong? offers fascinating insights into such questions as: Why fear growing diversity? Is there a European identity? Who determines who belongs? Is a single sense of &#39;good&#39; belonging in Europe dangerous? This collection provides a unique commentary on an insufficiently understood but defining phenomenon of our age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Authors include: Zia Haider Rahman, Goran Rosenberg, Isolde Charim, Hanno Loewy, Diana Pinto, Nira Yuval-Davis and Doron Rabinovici among others." />
