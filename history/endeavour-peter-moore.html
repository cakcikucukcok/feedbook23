  <title>Endeavour - Peter Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;An immense treasure trove of fact-filled and highly readable fun.&quot; --Simon Winchester, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times &lt;/i&gt;(U.K.) Best Book of 2018 and W&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;inner of the Mary Soames Award for History&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;An unprecedented history of the storied ship that Darwin said helped add a hemisphere to the civilized world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Enlightenment was an age of endeavors, with Britain consumed by the impulse for grand projects undertaken at speed. &lt;i&gt;Endeavour&lt;/i&gt; was also the name given to a collier bought by the Royal Navy in 1768. It was a commonplace coal-carrying vessel that no one could have guessed would go on to become the most significant ship in the chronicle of British exploration.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The first history of its kind, Peter Moore&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Endeavour: The Ship That Changed the World&lt;/i&gt; is a revealing and comprehensive account of the storied ship&#39;s role in shaping the Western world. &lt;i&gt;Endeavour&lt;/i&gt; famously carried James Cook on his first major voyage, charting for the first time New Zealand and the eastern coast of Australia. Yet it was a ship with many lives: During the battles for control of New York in 1776, she witnessed the bloody birth of the republic. As well as carrying botanists, a Polynesian priest, and the remains of the first kangaroo to arrive in Britain, she transported Newcastle coal and Hessian soldiers. NASA ultimately named a space shuttle in her honor. But to others she would be a toxic symbol of imperialism.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Through careful research, Moore tells the story of one of history&#39;s most important sailing ships, and in turn shines new light on the ambition and consequences of the Age of Enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
