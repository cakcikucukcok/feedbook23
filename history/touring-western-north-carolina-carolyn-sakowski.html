  <title>Touring Western North Carolina - Carolyn Sakowski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever been to the mountains of western North Carolina and wanted to see the scenery but escape the crowds? Maybe you were tempted to take off down a side road but hesitated, fearful of getting lost. Now, Touring the Western North Carolina Backroads can help you make that escape. The book’s 21 tours cover the entire mountain region of western North Carolina and provide numerous opportunities for seeing unspoiled landscapes and pastoral scenes. But scenery is not the only focus. Once you’re on the backroads, you might speculate about the history behind the old white clapboard farmhouse that dominates the valley ahead, or you might wonder about the rest of the story behind the two sentences on the historical marker at the side of the road. Touring the Western North Carolina Backroads fills in those details. Drawing from local histories and early travel writings, each tour is designed to be a journey through the history of the area. Tales of eccentric characters, folklore that has been passed down through the ages, and stories about early settlers combine to present a perspective that makes the scenery come alive. This third edition features updated directions, additional sites, new photographs, and nearby recreational opportunities. Use this guidebook to plan your next day trip, weekend getaway, or cycling adventure! John F. Blair’s Touring the Backroads™ series includes travel books that literally take readers off the beaten path to historic sites and landmarks. Each book departs the highways and thoroughfares in favor of the backroads, giving directions, suggested routes, and historical details along the way. These books can be read at home, or they make excellent travel companions for those looking for something beyond the norm." />
