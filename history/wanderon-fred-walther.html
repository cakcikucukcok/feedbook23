  <title>Wanderon - Fred Walther</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Our true story begins in Hungary with the Hungarian hussars, a group of mercenaries, and ends with the third generation, an American icon, Minnesota Fats, the hustler and entertainer known around the world. The lives of the three Wanderons have touched historys most memorable events from the past one hundred years of revolutions and wars around the world to audiences with world leaders, movie stars, corporate tycoons, mobsters and gangsters, famous entertainers, dignitaries, and celebrities.
History has been made clearer from the lives of the Wanderons as they travelled through decades of time spawning an incredible spirit of challenge and adventure. It is not only their adventure throughout the past 150 years and the uniqueness of the Wanderons, but also their secret of success and their ability to earn this success that mystifies the tablets of love and memory. It is not only the search for the keys to this successful formula, but also the keys to happiness that fuels this book.
Behind the scenes of many accepted historical accounts and explanations, there often exists hidden and undiscovered information yet to be brought to the surface. The desire to know the complete truth and the curious need to know the why of historical accounts is often void of the complete story as we know history today. But Wanderon will add spice and flavor and give a new perspective to the past while revealing a unique formula to the Wanderon success." />
