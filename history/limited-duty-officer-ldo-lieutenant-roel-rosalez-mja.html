  <title>Limited Duty Officer (Ldo) - Lieutenant Roel Rosalez Mja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;So why do they call limited duty officers in the U.S. Navy mustangs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats because mustangs are wild horses that are hard to tame, and even when they are broken, you have to be careful because at any time, they can revert to their old, wild ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LDOs come from the enlisted ranks but have crossed over to become commissioned officers, which requires them to adapt to a new lifestyle and perform accordinglysomething the author, Lt. Roel Ro Rosalezlearned firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He writes from the perspective of a man who was struggling to make ends meet and who wanted to provide for his family. In sharing his struggle, he explains what you need to focus on when trying to stand out as a candidate, how to fill out the application, and how to present yourself in a manner that improves your chance of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont be one of those sailors who always dreamed of becoming an LDO but who never applied. Find the motivation you need to advance, and make a successful leap with the guidance in Limited Duty Officer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
