  <title>The Great Okeechobee Hurricane of 1928 - Wayne Neely</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you live in the Caribbean or Florida, youve probably heard tales about the Great Okeechobee Hurricane, which killed thousands and left behind wide swaths of destruction.
Also known as the Saint Felipe (Phillip) Segundo Hurricane, it developed in the far eastern Atlantic before making its way over land and taking the lives of Bahamian migrant workers and Florida residents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thoroughly researched history considers the storm and its aftermath, exploring an important historical weather event that has been neglected. Through historical photographs of actual damage and personal recollections, author and veteran meteorologist Wayne Neely examines the widespread devastation that the hurricane caused. Youll get a detailed account on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	workers who were caught unprepared on the farms in the Okeechobee region of Florida;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	challenges that those involved in the recovery effort faced after the hurricane passed;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	personal and community turmoil that took decades to fully overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This massive storm killed at least 2,500 people in the United States of which approximately 1,400 were Bahamians migrant workers, becoming the second deadliest hurricane in the history of the United States, behind only the Great Galveston Hurricane of 1900. To this day, it remains the deadliest hurricane to ever strike the Bahamas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
