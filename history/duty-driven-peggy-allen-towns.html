  <title>Duty Driven - Peggy Allen Towns</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DUTY DRIVEN
The Plight of North Alabamas 
African Americans During the Civil War
For over a century and a half, history has not adequately captured the voices of African Americans during the Civil War. Duty Driven vividly summarizes the remarkable stories of North Alabamas African Americans, during this pivotal period in our history. The first person stories and eyewitness accounts bring together historical evidence that validate the past and bridge the truth, while emphasizing the crucial roles of African Americans during the War. 
Duty Driven explores the enlistment of United States Colored Troops in Decatur, the only Alabama town to actually raise such a regiment. It documents the surrender and capture of the 106th, 110th and 111th Colored Troops by General Nathan Bedford Forrest, at Athens and Sulphur Branch Trestle, Alabama and provides the names of prisoners of war taken to Mobile to work on the fortifications. Their gripping stories paint a vivid picture of their courage, valor and sacrifice. Drawing on personal accounts, extraordinary facts are uncovered about African Americans who served in integrated Federal troops, as well as those who served with the Confederate Army. Additionally, an enlightening glimpse of the contributions of women to this war of freedom is presented. 
The powerful narratives are proof that freedom comes at a great cost. As Americans, it is our duty to remember these extraordinary heroes and to acknowledge the truth of our Nations heritage." />
