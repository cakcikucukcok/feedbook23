  <title>Sons of Assumption: A History of a French Parochial High School In Massachusetts - Nancy Rocheleau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sons of Assumption explores the rich history of Assumption High School, then later Assumption Prep, which prepared boys for the priesthood for almost sixty-five years before closing in 1970.  With classes taught in French, it was not uncommon for Canadian and French families to entrust the school to turn their sons into godly men. In their own words, the graduates describe their feelings of homesickness, struggles with discipline, and how their experiences allowed them to succeed in their careers.  The author doesn&#39;t just provide a careful retelling of the graduates&#39; experiences, she also delves into the history of Worcester, Massachusetts, and how the school&#39;s buildings that its alumni hold so dear have since been repurposed.  As a distinctive and proud Franco-American Catholic boarding school, Assumption High offered its pupils an education that was rigorous, religious, and designed to preserve the French-Canadian language and culture that its students and their families cherished." />
