  <title>The Light of Asia - Sir Edwin Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this poetic masterpiece, Sir Edwin Arnold describes the life and teachings of Buddha. The man who was to become known as Buddha to the world was born as Prince Gautama of India but he rejected the worldly riches and abandoned the reigns of power when he embarked on a journey to discover the meaning of life. This poem reveals Buddha&amp;rsquo;s life from the Buddhist perspective but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a Buddhist to appreciate this poetic work. As you read about Buddha&amp;#39;s journey you will embark on your own course of discovery.&lt;br /&gt;
First published in 1879, the book has become a classic and has been published in many editions and many languages. Not only is it deeply philosophical in nature, but because of its poetic form and its narrative of the dramatic incidents in Siddhartha&amp;#39;s life, it is delightful and absorbing reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sir Edwin Arnold&lt;/strong&gt; (1832-1904), was an English author. After serving as principal of the government college in Pune, India, he joined (1861) the staff of the &amp;#39;London Daily Telegraph&amp;#39;. He won fame for his blank-verse epic &amp;#39;The Light of Asia&amp;#39; (1879), dealing with the life of Buddha. The poem was attacked for its alleged distortion of Buddhist doctrine and for its tolerant attitude toward a non-Christian religion. Besides other volumes of poetry, he wrote a number of picturesque travel books and translated Asian literature, inclding &amp;#39;The Bhagavad Gita&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
