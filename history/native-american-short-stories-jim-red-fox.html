  <title>Native American Short Stories - Jim Red Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jim Sarles AKA Jim Red Fox, was raised in the Catskill Mountains in
New York. On December 19, 2004, he suffered a debilitating stroke.
One positive result of this traumatic experience was a new ability to
think very creatively and to put these thoughts on paper. He began
writing about his childhood experiences in Livingston Manor.
He always knew that his blood line went back to the Lakota Sioux.
In 2009, he became a member of the Native American Cultural
Center where he is a member of the board. He is also a member of
the Thunder Bear Drum Circle. He was given the title of Story
Teller and the Indian name, Red Fox in 2010.
He began writing short stories of Native American Indians, reading to school children
and various Powwows. This is his first book but more will follow." />
