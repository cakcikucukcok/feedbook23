  <title>1944 Diary - Hans Keilson, Damion Searls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;[&lt;i&gt;1944 Diary&lt;/i&gt;] is a deeply personal account, made even more remarkable that it was written during World War II and the horrors of the Holocaust . . . A moving and fascinating read.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, FSG published two novels by the German- Jewish writer Hans Keilson:&lt;i&gt; Comedy in a Minor &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key&lt;/i&gt;--written in 1944 while Keilson was in hiding in the Netherlands, first published in German in 1947, and never before in English--and &lt;i&gt;The Death &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;of the Adversary&lt;/i&gt;, begun in 1944 and published in 1959, also in German. With their Chekhovian sympathy for perpetrators and bystanders as well as for victims and resisters, Keilson&#39;s novels were, as Francine Prose said on the front page of &lt;i&gt;The &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;masterpieces&quot; by &quot;a genius&quot; on her list of &quot;the world&#39;s very greatest writers.&quot; Keilson was one hundred years old, alive and well and able to enjoy his belated fame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1944 Diary&lt;/i&gt;, rediscovered among Keilson&#39;s papers shortly after his death, covers nine months he spent in hiding in Delft with members of a Dutch resistance group, having an affair with a younger Jewish woman in hiding a few blocks away and striving to make a moral and artistic life for himself as the war and the Holocaust raged around him. For readers familiar with Keilson&#39;s novels as well as those new to his work, this diary is an incomparable spiritual X-ray of the mind and heart behind the art: a record of survival and creativity in what Keilson called &quot;the most critical year of my life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering further insight into Keilson are the sonnets he wrote for his lover, Hanna Sanders, which appear in translation at the back of this volume.&lt;/p&gt;" />
