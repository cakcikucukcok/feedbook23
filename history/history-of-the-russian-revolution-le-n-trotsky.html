  <title>History of the Russian Revolution - León Trotsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;During the first two months of 1917 Russia was still a Romanov monarchy. Eight months later the Bolsheviks stood at the helm. They were little known to anybody when the year began, and their leaders were still under indictment for state treason when they came to power. You will not find another such sharp turn in history especially if you remember that it involves a nation of 150 million people. It is clear that the events of 1917, whatever you think of them, deserve study.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;--Leon Trotsky, from &lt;I&gt;History of the Russian Revolution &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regarded by many as among the most powerful works of history ever written, this book offers an unparalleled account of one of the most pivotal and hotly debated events in world history. This book reveals, from the perspective of one of its central actors, the Russian Revolution&amp;#8217;s profoundly democratic, emancipatory character.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Originally published in three parts, Trotsky&amp;#8217;s masterpiece is collected here in a single volume. It serves as the most vital and inspiring record of the Russian Revolution to date.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;[T]he greatest history of an event that I know.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;--C. L. R. James&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;In Trotsky all passions were aroused, but his thought remained calm and his vision clear.... His involvement in the struggle, far from blurring his sight, sharpens it.... The History is his crowning work, both in scale and power and as the fullest expression of his ideas on revolution. As an account of a revolution, given by one of its chief actors, it stands unique in world literature.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;--Isaac Deutscher&lt;/div&gt;" />
