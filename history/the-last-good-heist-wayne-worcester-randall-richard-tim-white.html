  <title>The Last Good Heist - Wayne Worcester, Randall Richard, Tim White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Aug. 14, 1975, eight daring thieves ransacked 148 massive safe-deposit boxes at a secret bank used by organized crime, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;La Cosa Nostra,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and its associates in Providence, R.I. The crooks fled with duffle bags crammed full of cash, gold, silver, stamps, coins, jewels and high-end jewelry. The true value of the loot has always been kept secret, partly because it was ill-gotten to begin with, and partly because there was plenty of incentive to keep its true worth out of the limelight. It&amp;#39;s one thing for authorities to admit they didn&amp;#39;t find a trace of goods worth from $3 million to $4 million, and entirely another when what was at stake was more accurately valued at about $30 million, the equivalent of $120 million today. It was the biggest single payday in the criminal history of the Northeast. Nobody came close, not the infamous James &amp;quot;Whitey&amp;quot; Bulger, not John &amp;quot;The Dapper Don&amp;quot; Gotti, not even the Brinks or Wells Fargo robbers. The heist was bold enough and big enough to rock the underworld to its core, and it left &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;La Cosa Nostra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; in the region awash in turmoil that still reverberates nearly 38 years later. &amp;quot;The Last Good Heist&amp;quot; is the inside story of the robbery and its aftermath.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
