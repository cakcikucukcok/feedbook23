  <title>Murder on the Underground Express - P. A. Gawel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Hollywood California resident, a low keyed yet aristocratic man was cherry picking high profile private investigations as he followed in his grandfather&#39;s footsteps. With the passing of his not so famous parents he inherited a great deal of money which made his driven ambition to obtain greatness in the world as a private eye only an egotistical goal as opposed to one of any financial return.  As it turned out, the twisted hand of fate dealt the celebrated Thin Man third generation offspring a fatal financial blow.  From the glitz and glamour of Hollywood to the blue collar life in Detroit; The Son of a Son of the Thin Man, Nicholas Charles III made the transition from millionaire to bar keep!  Left with only a small checking account, his health plus a dilapidated beer garden in Detroit Michigan Nick made his way to the Motor City to start life anew.  Up against the likes of Detroit&#39;s notorious Purple Gang revitalized after over eighty years, Nick teamed up with a hodgepodge group of amateur sleuths to battle the guerilla tactics of his nemesis; but who is he or she or they?  In the process Nick allies himself with ghosts, hookers, detectives, murderers, accountants, a lawyer, a few common folk and several dirty filthy stinking two legged rats to uncover an abominable terrorist attack on America&#39;s youth!   As one murder after another is committed, the Spirit of Detroit, a Detroit Icon for over 50 years almost gives up hope on Detroit.  The Spirit is put to the task of guiding the city back to prosperity by a second grade inner city school student, named Anna.  Her ideals combined with a spattering of urban renewal entrepreneurs inspire the Spirit of Detroit to take his place back as Detroit&#39;s guardian with a renewed vigor for another 50 years!" />
