  <title>Jean Bodin, &#39;this Pre-eminent Man of France&#39; - Howell A. Lloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jean Bodin was a figure of great importance in European intellectual history, known as a jurist, associate of kings and courtiers in sixteenth-century France, and author of influential works in the fields of constitutional and social thought, historical writing, witchcraft, and a great deal else besides.  Best known for his contribution to formulating the modern doctrine of sovereignty, Bodin was a scholar of exceptional range, whose works provoked controversy in his
own time and have continued to do so down the centuries. Hugh Trevor-Roper described him as &#39;the Aristotle, the Montesquieu of the sixteenth century, the prophet of comparative history, of political theory, of the philosophy of law, of the quantitative theory of money, and of so much else&#39;.
Much has been written on Bodin and his ideas, but in this new intellectual biography, Howell A. Lloyd presents the first rounded treatment of the thinker and his times, his writings (major and minor), and his ideas in their contemporary context, as well as in that of broader intellectual traditions." />
