  <title>Charlestown - David C. Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charlestown is a fictional story about the plight of Boston Taxi Cab drivers in the early 1980s and their struggle to form a Union as their answer to achieving better earnings and working conditions.  Harry Sharpstone, Union organizer, is dispatched by the Teamsters Union of Chicago to orchestrate this union organization.  Conflict, coalitions and struggle result.  Is resolve achieved?  Typically, Management and Unions never achieve permanent resolve, just a temporary platform for a truce.
     The coalitions are the Taxi Cab owners and Taxi Medallion owners who are frequently from Charlestown and the North End and are supported by the enforcement of local Mafia types associated with known racketeer Raymond Patriarca of Providence Mafia fame.  Since the issuance of these valuable Taxi Medallions is controlled by Boston Chief of Police Bratton he may be lending favor to the owners.  The other faction is the Taxi Cab Drivers.  They are supported by the efforts of the Teamsters which is ruled by James Hoffa, State Senate President Billy Bulger, who is known to favor the struggle of the blue collar worker, and Billys brother, Whitey Bulger, the suspected leader of the Winter Hill Gang and rackets in South Boston.  When these two factions clash over the power struggle between the Taxi Cab Medallion owners and the Taxi Cab Drivers the situation ranges from intense to combustible.     
     Local political and social culture creates a distinct Boston flavor as the story twists, turns and unfolds   Relax and enjoy for as long you can.  You may find yourself sliding to the edge of your seat not sure of how you got there." />
