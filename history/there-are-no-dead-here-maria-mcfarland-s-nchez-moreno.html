  <title>There Are No Dead Here - Maria McFarland Sánchez-Moreno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The bloody story of the rise of paramilitaries in Colombia, told through  three characters--a fearless activist, a dogged journalist, and a  relentless investigator--whose lives intersected in the midst of  unspeakable terror.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Colombia&#39;s drug-fueled cycle of terror, corruption, and tragedy did not end with Pablo Escobar&#39;s death in 1993. Just when Colombians were ready to move past the murderous legacy of the country&#39;s cartels, a new, bloody chapter unfolded. In the late 1990s, right-wing paramilitary groups with close ties to the cocaine business carried out a violent expansion campaign, massacring, raping, and torturing thousands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;There Are No Dead Here&lt;/i&gt; is the harrowing story of three ordinary Colombians who risked everything to reveal the collusion between the new mafia and much of the country&#39;s military and political establishment: Jesús María Valle, a human rights activist who was murdered for exposing a dark secret; Iván Velásquez, a quiet prosecutor who took up Valle&#39;s cause and became an unlikely hero; and Ricardo Calderón, a dogged journalist who is still being targeted for his revelations. Their groundbreaking investigations landed a third of the country&#39;s Congress in prison and fed new demands for justice and peace that Colombia&#39;s leaders could not ignore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking readers from the sweltering Medellín streets where criminal investigators were hunted by assassins, through the countryside where paramilitaries wiped out entire towns, and into the corridors of the presidential palace in Bogotá, &lt;i&gt;There Are No Dead Here&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable portrait of the valiant men and women who dared to stand up to the tide of greed, rage, and bloodlust that threatened to engulf their country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
