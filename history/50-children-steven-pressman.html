  <title>50 Children - Steven Pressman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Based on the acclaimed HBO documentary, the astonishing true story of how one American couple transported fifty Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Austria to America in 1939&amp;#8212;the single largest group of unaccompanied refugee children allowed into the United States&amp;#8212;for readers of &lt;em&gt;In the Garden of Beasts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;A Train in Winter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early 1939, America&amp;#39;s rigid immigration laws made it virtually impossible for European Jews to seek safe haven in the United States. As deep-seated anti-Semitism and isolationism gripped much of the country, neither President Roosevelt nor Congress rallied to their aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet one brave Jewish couple from Philadelphia refused to silently stand by. Risking their own safety, Gilbert Kraus, a successful lawyer, and his stylish wife, Eleanor, traveled to Nazi-controlled Vienna and Berlin to save fifty Jewish children. Steven Pressman brought the Kraus&amp;#39;s rescue mission to life in his acclaimed HBO documentary, &lt;em&gt;50 Children&lt;/em&gt;. In this book, he expands upon the story related in the hour-long film, offering additional historical detail and context to offer a rich, full portrait of this ordinary couple and their extraordinary actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing from Eleanor Kraus&amp;#39;s unpublished memoir, rare historical documents, and interviews with more than a dozen of the surviving children, and illustrated with period photographs, archival materials, and memorabilia, &lt;em&gt;50 Children&lt;/em&gt; is a remarkable tale of personal courage and triumphant heroism that offers a fresh, unique insight into a critical period of history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
