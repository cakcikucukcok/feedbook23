  <title>MoveOn&#39;s 50 Ways to Love Your Country - MoveOn.org</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With more than 2 million members, MoveOn is at the cutting edge of a new model for political activism. In their first-ever book, they take their message offline with MoveOn&#39;s 50 Ways to Love Your Country: How to Find Your Political Voice and Become a Catalyst for Change, in an effort to jumpstart an even broader civic dialogue and inspire all to become involved in our political process. With introductions by Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi, Gail Sheehy, David Fenton, and the MoveOn staff, MoveOn&#39;s 50 Ways to Love Your Country is a political call-to-action guide that includes 50 essays from MoveOn members across the country. Each essay is a compelling personal story with action items and resources. Simple ideas are illuminated, such as &quot;Vote, No Matter What,&quot; about a dying man&#39;s wish to cast a ballot, as are more dynamic actions, such as &quot;Start a Petition,&quot; which chronicles a couple&#39;s quest to protect endangered wolves in Alaska. For those who feel powerless or overwhelmed, angry or apathetic — or just want to do something, but don&#39;t know how — MoveOn&#39;s 50 Ways to Love Your Country answers the question so many people are asking, &quot;What can I do?&quot;" />
