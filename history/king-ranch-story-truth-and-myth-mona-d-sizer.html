  <title>King Ranch Story: Truth and Myth - Mona D. Sizer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The King Ranch Story is the love story of an ambitious young man and his dream of creating a great empire on Texas land. It&#39;s about the love between a man and woman, Captain Richard King and his wife Henrietta Chamberlain, the driving force behind King&#39;s success. It&#39;s a story of passion and power and success on a scale never seen before on this continent. King began his great enterprise with 15,500 acres of arid land called Rincon de Santa Gertrudis, purchased for $300 in 1853. From there it has grown to become an international legend. It was here that the great Santa Gertrudis cattle, and the indispensable western quarter horse were developed. The book also includes terrifying stories of ancient ghosts and hauntings that still imbue many of the secret places on the ranch with a sense of mystery and fear." />
