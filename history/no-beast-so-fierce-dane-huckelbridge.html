  <title>No Beast So Fierce - Dane Huckelbridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;#160;astonishing true story of the man-eating tiger that claimed a record 437 human lives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Thrilling. Fascinating. Exciting.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &amp;#8226; &quot;&lt;/em&gt;Riveting. Haunting.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nepal, c. 1900:&amp;#160;A lone&amp;#160;tigress&amp;#160;began stalking humans, moving like a phantom through the lush foothills of the Himalayas. As the death toll reached an astonishing 436 lives, a young local hunter was dispatched to stop the man-eater before it struck again. This is the&amp;#160;extraordinary true story of the &quot;Champawat Man-Eater,&quot; the deadliest animal in recorded history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One part pulse-pounding thriller, one part soulful natural history of the endangered Royal Bengal tiger, &lt;em&gt;No Beast So Fierce&lt;/em&gt; is Dane Huckelbridge&amp;#8217;s&amp;#160;gripping&amp;#160;nonfiction account&amp;#160;of the Champawat tiger, which terrified northern India and Nepal from 1900 to 1907, and Jim Corbett, the legendary hunter who pursued it. Huckelbridge&amp;#8217;s masterful telling also reveals that the tiger, Corbett, and the forces that brought them together are far more complex and fascinating than a simple man-versus-beast tale. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the twentieth century as British rule of India tightened and bounties were placed on tiger&amp;#8217;s heads, a tigress was shot in the mouth by a poacher. Injured but alive, it turned from its usual hunting habits to easier prey&amp;#8212;humans. For the next seven years, this man-made killer terrified locals, growing bolder with every kill. Colonial authorities, desperate for help, finally called upon Jim Corbett, a then-unknown railroad employee of humble origins who had grown up hunting game through the hills of Kumaon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a detective on the trail of a serial killer, Corbett tracked the tiger&amp;#8217;s movements in the dense, hilly woodlands&amp;#8212;meanwhile the animal shadowed Corbett in return. Then, after a heartbreaking new kill of a young woman whom he was unable to protect, Corbett followed the gruesome blood trail deep into the forest where hunter and tiger would meet at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing upon on-the-ground research in the Indian Himalayan region where he retraced Corbett&amp;#8217;s footsteps, Huckelbridge brings to life one of the great adventure stories of the twentieth century. And yet Huckelbridge brings a deeper, more complex story into focus, placing the episode into its full context for the first time: that of colonialism&amp;#8217;s disturbing impact on the ancient balance between man and tiger; and that of Corbett&amp;#8217;s own evolution from a celebrated hunter to a&amp;#160; principled conservationist who in time would earn fame for his devotion to saving the Bengal tiger and its habitat. Today the Corbett Tiger Reserve preserves 1,200 km of wilderness; within its borders is Jim Corbett National Park, India&amp;#8217;s oldest and most prestigious national park and a vital haven for the very animals Corbett once hunted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unforgettable tale, magnificently told, &lt;em&gt;No Beast So Fierce &lt;/em&gt;is an epic of beauty, terror, survival, and redemption for the ages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
