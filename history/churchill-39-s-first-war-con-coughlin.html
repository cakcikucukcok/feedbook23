  <title>Churchill&#39;s First War - Con Coughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Churchill&#39;s First War &lt;/i&gt;by Con Coughlin is a fascinating account of Winston Churchill&#39;s early military career fighting in the 1890 Afghan campaign, offering fresh and revealing parallels into today&#39;s war in Afghanistan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Just over a century ago British troops were fighting a vicious frontier war against Pashtun tribeman on the North West Frontier--the great-great-grandfathers of the Taliban and tribal insurgents in modern-day Afghanistan. Winston Churchill, then a young cavalry lieutenant, wrote a vivid account of what he saw during his first major campaign. &lt;i&gt;The Story of the Malakand Field Force&lt;/i&gt;, published in 1898, was Churchill&#39;s first book and, a hundred years later, is required reading for military commanders on the ground, both British and American.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Churchill&#39;s First War&lt;/i&gt;, acclaimed author and foreign correspondent, Con Coughlin tells the story of that campaign, a story of high adventure and imperial success, which contains many lessons and warnings for today. Combining historical narrative, interviews with contemporary key players, and the journalist&#39;s eye for great color and analysis, &lt;i&gt;Churchill&#39;s First War &lt;/i&gt;affords us a rare insight into both the nineteenth-century &quot;Great Game&quot; and the twenty-first-century conflict that has raged longer than World War II.&lt;/p&gt;" />
