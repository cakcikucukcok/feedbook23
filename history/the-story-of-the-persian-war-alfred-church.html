  <title>The Story of the Persian War - Alfred Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="King Darius gave Myrcinus that is on the river Strymon, in the land of Thrace, to Histi&amp;aelig;us, lord of Miletus, for a reward; for Histi&amp;aelig;us had done him good service in his warfare against the Scythians. But when the man began to build a wall about the place, one said to the King, &amp;quot;O King, what is this that thou hast done, giving this city in Thrace to a man that is a Greek, and wise moreover and crafty? For in that country is great store of timber for ship-building, and mines also of silver and there are many inhabitants, both Greeks and barbarians, who will take this fellow for a leader, and will do what he shall bid them, working day and night. Do thou therefore stay him in this work; but stay him with soft words. Bid him come to thee, and when he is come, take good care that he never go among the Greeks any more.&amp;quot; This counsel seemed good to the King. Wherefore he sent a messenger to Histi&amp;aelig;us, saying, &amp;quot;Thus saith the King, I am persuaded that there is no better man disposed to me and to my kingdom than thou. Come therefore to me, for I have great matters in hand and would fain ask thy counsel about them.&amp;quot; So Histi&amp;aelig;us, taking these words to be true, and counting it a great thing to be the King&amp;#39;s counselor, came to Sardis to Darius. And when he was come, Darius said to him, &amp;quot;Hear now the cause wherefore I have sent for thee. Since the day that thou didst depart from me I have desired nothing so much as to see thee and talk with thee; for in my judgment there is nothing so precious as a friend that is both faithful and wise; and this I know thee to be. Leave now thy city of Miletus, and that also which thou art building in Thrace, and come with me to Susa, for all that I have is thine, and thou shalt live with me, and be my counselor.&amp;quot;" />
