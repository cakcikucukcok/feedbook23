  <title>Journey to a Brave New World - David Watts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our Way of life and our very existence are under threat.&lt;/br&gt;
Get educated and resist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Aldous Huxleys Brave New World, published in 1932, we are provided with a view into a possible future that shows humanity under total control. Its a world in which babies are created in the laboratory to fit specific job functions and a small number of savages live in the restricted wild lands. &lt;i&gt;Journey to a Brave New World&lt;/i&gt; uses examples of news reports and the real history not always the version taught in the classroom to show how we are being managed and manipulated to allow for a total tyrannical takeover and massive depopulation that could lead us to Huxleys vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over six years, author David Watts has undertaken deep research into the real history of the world and the ways in which it is being manipulated toward a future that only benefits an elite few. He provides many news reports, official documents and quotes from the so called elites to piece the puzzle together. He presents a cohesive exploration of what to expect in the future if we dont become involved in determining our own fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Journey to a Brave New World&lt;/i&gt; seeks to help everyone to put the pieces together, deprogram, and understand both how we are being manipulated and how we can change direction now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
