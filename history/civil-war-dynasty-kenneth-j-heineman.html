  <title>Civil War Dynasty - Kenneth J. Heineman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;For years the Ewing family of Ohio has been lost in the historical  shadow cast by their in-law, General William T. Sherman. In the era of  the Civil War, it was the Ewing family who raised Sherman, got him into  West Point, and provided him with the financial resources and political  connections to succeed in war. The patriarch, Thomas Ewing, counseled  presidents and clashed with radical abolitionists and southern  secessionists leading to the Civil War. Three Ewing sons became Union  generals, served with distinction at Antietam and Vicksburg, marched  through Georgia, and fought guerrillas in Missouri. The Ewing family  stood at the center of the Northern debate over emancipation, fought for the soul of the Republican Party, and waged total war against the  South.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Civil War Dynasty&lt;/em&gt;, Kenneth J. Heineman brings  to life this drama of political intrigue and military valor&amp;#8212;warts and  all. This work is a military, political, religious, and family history,  told against the backdrop of disunion, war, violence, and grief. &lt;/div&gt;" />
