  <title>The Hamilton Collection - Dan Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The subject of a &lt;i&gt;New York Time&lt;/i&gt;s best-selling biography and a  Pulitzer-Prize winning musical, interest in Alexander Hamilton is at an  all-time high. This carefully curated collection of Hamilton&#39;s writings  gives the reader an intimate glimpse into the mind of our most  misunderstood founding father.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The smash-hit musical &lt;i&gt;Hamilton &lt;/i&gt;presents  its central character as a truth-telling immigrant boot-strapper who  used his extraordinary intelligence to make good--but what was he really  like? Let the man himself, a prolific and  extremely effective writer, tell his story in his own words. &lt;br&gt;Organized  chronologically, this collection of Alexander Hamilton&#39;s personal  letters, business and governmental correspondence, and excerpts from his  most important published writings (including the Federalist Papers)  gives readers first-hand insight into this highly influential founding  father who             engineered the ratification of the US Constitution, created the United&lt;br&gt;States&#39; financial system, and established friendly trade relations with Britain. &lt;br&gt;The  book includes love letters to Elizabeth Schuyler, who became his wife,  and correspondence with his friend-turned-nemesis, Aaron Burr, which led  to the duel in Weehawken that ended Hamilton&#39;s life at the age of 47.  Also included are responses from some of his correspondents that give a  360-degree  view of the man so esteemed by his protector and friend, George  Washington, but reviled by others, including Washington&#39;s successor as  president, John Adams.&lt;br&gt;Illustrated with 50 illustrations, drawings, document facsimiles and more,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;the text is accompanied throughout by explanatory annotations from editor Dan Tucker who also provides introductions to each  chapter and a preface.&lt;br&gt;" />
