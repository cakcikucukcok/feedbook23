  <title>The Road to Delhi - M. Sivaram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Although the peaceful struggles of Mahatma Gandhi are well known in the West, the armed resistance of many Indians during World War II is far less understood; this epic drama ads an important layer to the history of India and the British Empire. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The east Asian battlefronts serve as the backgrounds for this story of the attempt by patriotic Indians to drive the British out of their Motherland and gain independence; of the fanatic ambition to attain this goal by the man who chose to be called &quot;Nataji&quot; (the leader), Subhas Chandra Bose; and of the Indian Independence League, ingratiating themselves to the Japanese to further their end while the Japanese happily appeared to reciprocate to gain the Indians&#39; support against the British.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The action and drama that filled this battle within the larger scale war is vividly told in this first person narrative by one who remembers what it feels like to have closely escaped death and is grateful to be alive to tell about it.  Author Sivaram, who enjoyed the confidence of Netaji Bose and was appointed by him to several positions of responsibility during the Free India campaign, is uniquely qualified to tell this stirring tale.&lt;/div&gt;" />
