  <title>Nelson - the New Letters - Colin White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Nelson was a letter writer of great flair and somehow, between his naval service and recovering from various illnesses and wounds and, of course, despite his famously tangled love-life, he managed to write an extraordinary number of them, on all subjects and addressed to all manner of recipients. This widely-praised volume collects together over 500 of those letters, dating from 1777 to just days before the Battle of Trafalgar that would seal both his fate and his fame. They range from detailed battle orders to passionate love letters, from the business of securing - or giving - patronage to diplomatic reports for kings, queens, politicians and dignitaries. &lt;br&gt; All aspects of Nelson&#39;s life are covered here, particularly his seldom-glimpsed family life, so that the reader cannot fail to see him in a new light. Nor can any reader fail to marvel at the combination of traits that made the man great: his brilliant leadership and organisation, his daring and ruthless military mind and, not least, his very real compassion, even for his enemies.&lt;br&gt; Dr COLIN WHITE is Director of the Royal Naval Museum in Portsmouth, UK. One of Britain&#39;s leading naval historians, he is recognised worldwide as an authority on Nelson. In 2005, he was the mastermind behind the hugely successful &#39;Trafalgar Festival&#39;, for which he was awarded the Longman-History Today Trustees Prize.&lt;br&gt; Published in association with the National Maritime Museum and the Royal Naval Museum.&lt;/div&gt;" />
