  <title>It Shouldn&#39;t Happen (to a Dog) - Don Freeman, Todd DePastino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Army life didn&#39;t agree with GI Albert C. Bedlington, Jr. He felt like he was always crawling on all fours, and one day when the very thing he&#39;d feared for months finally happened &amp;#8212; he had become a dog! The fellas all recognized him, so he carried on as usual, going on a furlough, visiting the USO, getting in and out of trouble, and serving with the K-9 corps.&lt;BR&gt;Recounted chiefly in winsome illustrations, this fantasy was written and drawn by Don Freeman, author of &lt;I&gt;Corduroy&lt;/I&gt; and other children&#39;s books. His witty and unusual take on World War II&amp;#8211;era life among the enlisted men and on the home front was hailed by the &lt;I&gt;Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/I&gt; as a &quot;fantastic and captivating story&quot; and by the &lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune &lt;/I&gt;as &quot;wonderful fun.&quot;&lt;I&gt; &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
