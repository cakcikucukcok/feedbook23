  <title>One Man Against the World - Tim Weiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A shocking and riveting look at one of the most dramatic and  disastrous presidencies in US history, from Pulitzer Prize and National  Book Award winner Tim Weiner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Based largely on documents declassified only in the last few years, &lt;i&gt;One Man Against the World &lt;/i&gt;paints  a devastating portrait of a tortured yet brilliant man who led the  country largely according to a deep-seated insecurity and distrust of  not only his cabinet and congress, but the American population at large.  In riveting, tick-tock prose, Weiner illuminates how the Vietnam War  and the Watergate controversy that brought about Nixon&#39;s demise were  inextricably linked.  From the hail of garbage and curses that awaited  Nixon upon his arrival at the White House, when he became the president  of a nation as deeply divided as it had been since the end of the Civil  War, to the unprecedented action Nixon took against American citizens,  who he considered as traitorous as the army of North Vietnam, to the  infamous break-in and the tapes that bear remarkable record of the most  intimate and damning conversations between the president and his  confidantes, Weiner narrates the history of Nixon&#39;s anguished presidency  in fascinating and fresh detail.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crucial new look at the greatest political suicide in history, &lt;i&gt;One Man Against the World&lt;/i&gt;  leaves us not only with new insight into this tumultuous period, but  also into the motivations and demons of an American president who saw  enemies everywhere, and, thinking the world was against him, undermined  the foundations of the country he had hoped to lead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
