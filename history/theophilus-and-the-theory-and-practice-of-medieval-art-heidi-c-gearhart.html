  <title>Theophilus and the Theory and Practice of Medieval Art - Heidi C. Gearhart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this study of the rare twelfth-century treatise &lt;em&gt;On Diverse Arts&lt;/em&gt;, Heidi C. Gearhart explores the unique system of values that guided artists of the High Middle Ages as they created their works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in northern Germany by a monk known only by the pseudonym Theophilus, &lt;em&gt;On Diverse Arts&lt;/em&gt; is the only known complete tract on art to survive from the period. It contains three books, each with a richly religious prologue, describing the arts of painting, glass, and metalwork. Gearhart places this one-of-a-kind treatise in context alongside works by other monastic and literary thinkers of the time and presents a new reading of the text itself. Examining the earliest manuscripts, she reveals a carefully ordered, sophisticated work that aligns the making of art with the virtues of a spiritual life. &lt;em&gt;On Diverse Arts&lt;/em&gt;, Gearhart shows, articulated a distinctly medieval theory of art that accounted for the entire process of production&amp;mdash;from thought and preparation to the acquisition of material, the execution of work, the creation of form, and the practice of seeing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An important new perspective on one of the most significant texts in art history and the first study of its kind available in English, &lt;em&gt;Theophilus and the Theory and Practice of Medieval Art&lt;/em&gt; provides fresh insight into the principles and values of medieval art making. Scholars of art history, medieval studies, and Christianity will find Gearhart&amp;rsquo;s book especially edifying and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
