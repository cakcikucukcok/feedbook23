  <title>Taking out the Garbage - Robert Clayton Buick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The front cover of this book depicts the true and fatal wounds to President
John F. Kennedy that was never revealed by the Warren Commission or by the
official autopsy report. Instead, the United States Government and high ranking
government officials responsible for the assassination of President Kennedy
covered up the truth in an attempt to hide the coup de tat assassination.
This is the story of Jimmy Sutton the Mafia Grassy Knoll Shooter who fired
the fatal shot to the right temple of President Kennedy ordered and carried
out by Organized Crime. Lee Harvey Oswald never fired a shot at President
Kennedy. The author Robert Clayton Buick who was aware of the plot prior to
the assassination of President Kennedy pulls no punches as he clarifies and
substantiates every element of the hit on the President of the United States,
the crime of the century for financial gain, political power and vengeance. This
is a nonfictional and true depiction of what really happened that fateful day in
Dallas." />
