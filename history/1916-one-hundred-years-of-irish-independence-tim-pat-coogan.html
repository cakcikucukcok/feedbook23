  <title>1916: One Hundred Years of Irish Independence - Tim Pat Coogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s &lt;i&gt;before &lt;/i&gt;1916 and then there&#39;s &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt;. Between them lies the Easter Rising, when Irish republicans took up arms against British rule and changed the course of their country&#39;s history forever. For though the resistance failed, it failed gloriously; the rebels were no longer a group of cranks and troublemakers in the public eye, but martyrs and national heroes, their example set the way for others and their mission lived on through the century to come.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But what sort of country did the Rising create? And how does post-1916 Ireland compare with the aspirations of the rebellion&#39;s leaders, the hopes of Thomas MacDonagh and John MacBride, of James Connolly and Patrick Pearse?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One hundred years later, Tim Pat Coogan offers a personal perspective on the Irish experience that followed the Rising. He charts a flawed history that is marked as much by complacency, corruption, and institutional abuse as it is by the building of a nation and the sacrifices of the Republic&#39;s founding fathers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
