  <title>America&#39;s War Machine - James McCartney, Molly Sinclair McCartney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When President Dwight D. Eisenhower prepared to leave the White House in 1961, he did so with an ominous message for the American people about the &quot;disastrous rise&quot; of the military-industrial complex. Fifty years later, the complex has morphed into a virtually unstoppable war machine, one that dictates U.S. economic and foreign policy in a direct and substantial way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on his experiences as an award-winning Washington-based reporter covering national security, James McCartney presents a compelling history, from the Cold War to present day that shows that the problem is far worse and far more wide-reaching than anything Eisenhower could have imagined. Big Military has become &quot;too big to fail&quot; and has grown to envelope the nation&#39;s political, cultural and intellectual institutions. These centers of power and influence, including the now-complicit White House and Congress, have a vested interest in preparing and waging unnecessary wars. The authors persuasively argue that not one foreign intervention in the past 50 years has made us or the world safer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With additions by Molly Sinclair McCartney, a fellow journalist with 30 years of experience, &lt;i&gt;America&#39;s War Machine&lt;/i&gt; provides the context for today&#39;s national security state and explains what can be done about it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
