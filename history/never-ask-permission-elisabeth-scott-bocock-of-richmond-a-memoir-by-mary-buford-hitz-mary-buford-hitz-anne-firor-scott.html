  <title>Never Ask Permission: Elisabeth Scott Bocock of Richmond, A Memoir by Mary Buford Hitz - Mary Buford Hitz, Anne Firor Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Some cities, through hardship or glory or a combination of both, produce     extraordinary women. Richmond in the early twentieth century, dominated by its prominent     families and still haunted by the ghosts of its Confederate past, produced a galaxy of such     characters, including Ellen Glasgow, Mary Cooke Branch Munford, and Lila Meade Valentine.     Elisabeth Scott Bocock, Victorian in values but modern in outlook, carried on this tradition     with her unique combination of family wealth and connections, boundless energy, eccentricity,     and visionary zeal. Her daughter Mary Buford Hitz&#39;s candid memoir reveals the pleasures and     frustrations of growing up with a woman who expected so much from her children and from the city     whose self-appointed guardian she became.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elisabeth Bocock&#39;s vision was of a     city that would take historic preservation seriously, of a society that would accept the     importance of conservation. Impatient with process and society&#39;s conventions, she used her     enormous personal magnetism to circumvent them when founding many of the institutions Richmond     takes for granted today. In the creation of the Historic Richmond Foundation, the Carriage     Museum at Maymont, the Hand Workshop, and the Virginia Chapter of the Nature Conservancy she     played the dual roles of visionary and bulldozer. While part of a tradition of strong southern     women, Elisabeth Bocock&#39;s tactics were unique, as she sought to convince others of both the     practical and aesthetic links between preservation and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of     the &quot;five little Scotts,&quot; children of the founder of the investment firm Scott &amp;amp;     Stringfellow, she grew up with great privilege, and she schooled her children in how to take     advantage of such privilege and how to ignore it. Whether in their winter residence at 909 West     Franklin Street in Richmond or at their summer home, Royal Orchard, in the Blue Ridge Mountains,     in her household she insisted both on achievement and on avoiding boredom at all     costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mary Buford Hitz recounts with intelligence and feeling, her mother     often seemed like a natural force, leveling anything that stood in its way but leaving in its     wake a brighter, changed world. Never Ask Permission is not only a daughter&#39;s honest portrait of     a charismatic and difficult woman who broke the threads of convention; in Elisabeth Scott Bocock     we recognize the flawed but feisty, enduring character of Richmond.&lt;/p&gt;" />
