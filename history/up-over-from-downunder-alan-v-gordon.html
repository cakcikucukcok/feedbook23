  <title>Up over from Downunder - Alan V. Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Dr Shane Woods, a young archaeologist, is working on his first independent dig in Central Australia, when he finds among the remains of an ancient camp-fire a large bone upon which is engraved an unusual ritual scene of two figures standing arms outstretched, completely surrounded by a serpent in the shape of a sun-disk. Could this be evidence of a pre-historic belief system? Was this the earliest evidence of the &quot;Dreaming&quot;, a time before time itself, when the divine Sky Spirits had created the earth and mankind?&lt;p&gt;Next he discovers what he considers to be tangible evidence of aboriginal occupation, later dated over 500,000 years. This leads him to challenge the traditional &quot; Out of Africa&quot; hypothesis, with his own controversial viewpoint that modern man&#39;s origins are from the Australian Aborigines, who were a distinctly different species of Homo Sapiens,that had migrated along &quot;Sacred Path&#39;s&quot; during the Pleistocene period, coming &quot;Out of Australia&quot;, across land bridges which had connected the supercontinent of Sahuland, consisting of Tasmania,Australia,New Guinea and the thousands of islands that are now part of the Indonesian and 
Philippine island chains.&lt;p&gt;The enormity of his finds, make him realize that he needs a prestigious senior person to help him to confirm the authenticity of his discoveries,so he calls upon his old friend Dick Goldman, a Professor of Archaeology 
from UCLA. It is with his arrival to the Northern Territory, that this adventure into man&#39;s deepest past, begins its most unusual journey.&lt;p&gt;This book traces the twists and turns of this journey, the near arrest of the archaeologists by the CIA and US military, for tresspassing on US controlled land in the heart of Aboriginal Australia, and the dismissal 
these highly controversial explanations and radical new views on the origins of modern man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
