  <title>The Story of My Life - Ehsanullah Sherdil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book leads you through Afghani religion, politics, and culture in different times of history. This country has always been invaded by surrounding countries, as well as super powers. However, Afghans are free people, who are fond of freedom, with a free hospitable spirit and have always pushed the invaders back to their place. Afghanistan has its own tradition of food, sport and music, which are now world re known. Afghanistan is also a beautiful country with mountains, rivers, and lovely valleys, which unfortunately are over-shadowed by the politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book gives you information about the problems, that Afghanistan has and why they are difficult to resolve, despite a lot of help from other countries and international organizations. The political competition from neighboring countries and super powers may cause Afghanistan to either move ahead quickly or be destroyed to the ground. Almost all of the weapons come to this country from different parts of the world. None are made in Afghanistan. Afghan people are mostly making carpets, handicrafts, furniture, clothes, shoes, coats, and jewelery, and etc. not weapons. Most of the people were and are farmers, not soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This books is a call for people to work shoulder to shoulder, in order to bring peace and prosperity to this beautiful country. It is a cry&lt;br /&gt;to work together with the noble people of Afghanistan to stop killing, torturing, and suffering in this part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
