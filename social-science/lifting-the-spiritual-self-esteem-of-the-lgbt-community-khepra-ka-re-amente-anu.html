  <title>Lifting the Spiritual Self-Esteem of the Lgbt Community - Khepra Ka-Re Amente Anu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lifting the Spiritual Self-Esteem of the LGBT Community&lt;/i&gt; is written for all peoplewhether heterosexual or members of the LGBT communitywho are disgusted with the judgmental and discriminatory way that religions project and impose their beliefs onto the lives of others in the self-righteous name of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;Author Khepra Ka-Re Amente Anu provides source material for readers to counter and fight back against religious institutions, organizations, and individuals who condemn any lifestyle that does not conform to their own narrow ideology. He offers a critique of the man-made, mythological religions of Africa-Egypt/Ethiopia, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the exception of Buddhism, religions are violent; the scriptures of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are manuals that provide instructional and operational guidelines for the enslavement of humans. Hinduism promotes a brutal and discriminatory caste system, while Christianity and Judaism give instructions about enslaving children, breeding male and female slaves, and the beating and killing of slaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No benevolent God would approve of violence or slavery. Religions are nothing more than man-made myths that should be cast in the same light as Santa Claus, Peter Pan, or Tinker Bell.&lt;/p&gt;" />
