  <title>How You Can Command Respect and Be Loved for It - James TAYLOR</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After writing &#39;I Want What They&#39;ve Got&#39; which gives a plan for all round self-improvement, I felt there was a need for a book which dealt more specifically with &#39;presence&#39; and &#39;leadership&#39;, hence &#39;How You Can Command Respect And Be Loved For It&#39;                                                                                                                                                                                                                      This book is for people who wish to become more assertive and more respected, and is full of exercises and tips to raise your social status. For example, in a conversation where you wish to impress, you probably agree a lot of the time which you know will generate rapport. If you disagree sometimes you will show that you have your own mind, and may stimulate more conversation. Agreement is compliance which generates rapport, disagreement generates status, careful balance is needed.&lt;p&gt;
People may bully you, using presuppositions to lower your status. Presuppositions are nasty put-downs which are hard to respond to quickly. Examples,&#39;You know you can&#39;t do it!&#39; or &#39;Do you realize you&#39;re letting the team down?&#39; This book examines presupposition patterns with many exercises and examples, enabling you to respond to them quickly and effectively.&lt;p&gt;
If you wish to speak to a busy person you risk being nervous, speaking too quickly and losing status. You can make them WANT to hear your words, also you can use this &#39;being busy&#39; phenomena to YOUR advantage!&lt;p&gt;
This book is full of exercises, tips, eye openers and social dynamics to change your life for the better, for ever." />
