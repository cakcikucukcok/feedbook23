  <title>Culture in Conflict - Paula Holmes-Eber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In response to the irregular warfare challenges facing the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2005, General James Mattis—then commander of Marine Corps Combat Development Command—established a new Marine Corps cultural initiative. The goal was simple: teach Marines to interact successfully with the local population in areas of conflict. The implications, however, were anything but simple: transform an elite military culture founded on the principles of &quot;locate, close with, and destroy the enemy&quot; into a &quot;culturally savvy&quot; Marine Corps.
&lt;I&gt;Culture in Conflict: Irregular Warfare, Culture Policy, and the Marine Corps&lt;/I&gt; examines the conflicted trajectory of the Marine Corps&#39; efforts to institute a radical culture policy into a military organization that is structured and trained to fight conventional wars. More importantly, however, it is a compelling book about America&#39;s shifting military identity in a new world of unconventional warfare." />
