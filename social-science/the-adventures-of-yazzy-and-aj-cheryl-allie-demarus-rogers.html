  <title>The Adventures of Yazzy and Aj - Cheryl Allie, Demarus Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yazzy imagines her dad as a little boy in Freetown, Sierra Leone. She often asks what was this place that holds the answer to so many of her questions about her familys history? The springtime visit to Sapelo Island was far beyond AJ and Yazzys imagination! They couldnt believe that there was so much history on the island! The best part of the visit was learning that the people who live there have a family history that is exactly like hers  ancestors from Freetown, Sierra Leone! The twins become intrigued with the continent of Africa, especially Sierra Leone. They ask lots of questions and become increasingly curious about the land, the people, the animals, and traditional foods like her dad and grandma cooks. At the start of summer vacation, Yazzys wish comes true and the twins are overjoyed to know they will now see the place their father grew up!The family arrives in Freetown and is greeted to many hugs and kisses, lots of food and laughter, and the wonderful sights and sounds of the land. They are introduced to many family members and make many new friends. The most interesting friend they meet is Colobus, the monkey. Colobus introduces the twins to the lovely habitats and history of Sierra Leone. AJ and Yazzy are more curious about all of Africa with more questions than Colobus can answer, so he seeks the answers from the Wise Old Owl who lives on Bunce Island. The Wise Old Owl answers questions for the two in the form of a riddle. In order to find the answer to questions and riddles, the pair will have to travel back in time through the Old Slave Fort to understand more about present day cultures after their explorations." />
