  <title>The Division of Heaven and Earth - Shokdung, Matthew Akester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a translation of one of the most influential and important books from Tibet in the modern era, a passionate indictment of Chinese policies and an eloquent analysis of protests that swept Tibet from March, 2008 - the &#39;Earth Rat&#39; year according to the Tibetan calendar - as a re-awakening of Tibetan national consciousness and solidarity.
The Division of Heaven and Earth was banned by the Chinese government on publication, and led to Shokdung being &quot;disappeared&quot; and imprisoned for nearly six months. This English translation is being made available for the first time since copies began to circulate underground in Tibet.
The author, Tagyal -- who uses the pen name Shokdung, meaning &quot;morning conch&quot;-- one of Tibet&#39;s leading intellectuals, wrote his book in response to an unprecedented wave of bold demonstrations and expressions of Tibetan solidarity and national identity.
In his foreword Matthew Akester, a Tibet specialist who translated this book into English, offers an account of the significance of these developments, which transformed the political landscape across the plateau and led to a sustained and violent crackdown by the Chinese authorities that continues to this day.
Shokdung&#39;s book is regarded as the most daring and wide-ranging critique of China&#39;s policies in Tibet since the 10th Panchen" />
