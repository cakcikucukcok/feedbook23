  <title>An American Speaks Out - N. E. Parks, Jed Helmers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are fundamental flaws in our political system and the policies, cost, and function of the federal government that seriously need to be corrected for this country to be the great country it once was for all those seeking the American dream. The American dream is different and personal for each individual, but the concept revolves around the ability for all people to be free to self-actualize their talents, abilities, and desires, not just for fame and fortune, but in order to live a happy and prosperous life. 
Thus, the American dream is about ensuring that we look out for the greater good in our policies and legislation that support opportunities for health, education, housing, research and development, innovation, jobs, and retirement. We have contracted with our government officials to carry this out. If they are not willing to act, then we must react by seeking out good candidates and voting for them. 
In a timely discussion, her book provides some common sense ideas on how to put the government back in the hands of the people who have had their lives turned upside down from loss of jobs, the mortgage crisis, high cost of education and healthcare, risky 401ks, and an insecurity in the future not seen since the Great Depression. 
She outlines how the nation got into such a mess and proposes a domestic plan to focus on the national priorities most Americans are concerned about. She outlines how to get Americans back to work, reduce the federal budget deficit, establish national priorities, make congress functional so it can do its job, make the federal government more effective and efficient, better educate our children, improve our infrastructure, and, as a result, hopefully reduce crime and create opportunity for our people." />
