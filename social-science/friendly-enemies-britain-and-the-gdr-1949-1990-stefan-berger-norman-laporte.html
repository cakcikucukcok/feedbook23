  <title>Friendly Enemies: Britain and the GDR, 1949-1990 - Stefan Berger, Norman Laporte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 	During the Cold War, Britain had an astonishing number of contacts and connections with one of the Soviet Bloc&#39;s most hard-line regimes: the German Democratic Republic. The left wing of the British Labour Party and the Trade Unions often had closer ties with communist East Germany than the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). There were strong connections between the East German and British churches, women&#39;s movements, and peace movements; influential conservative politicians and the Communist leadership in the GDR had working relationships; and lucrative contracts existed between business leaders in Britain and their counterparts in East Germany. Based on their extensive knowledge of the documentary sources, the authors provide the first comprehensive study of Anglo-East German relations in this surprisingly under-researched field. They examine the complex motivations underlying different political groups&#39; engagement with the GDR, and offer new and interesting insights into British political culture during the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;" />
