  <title>Arguing with God - J. T. Hutcherson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The battle over the gay question continues, and its much more than a simple disagreement over sexual preference or orientation. Its an emotionally charged issue debated by politicians and preachers alike that threatens to topple the house of Christianity. In &lt;i&gt;Arguing with God,&lt;/i&gt; author J. T. Hutcherson addresses relevant issues that spark the debate between Christian fundamentalists and homosexuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through a dialogue between friendsEli, an evangelical, fundamentalist Christian; and Jay, a religious liberal and former fundamentalist ChristianHutcherson offers an authentic discussion about God, religion, bigotry, and homosexuality. &lt;i&gt;Arguing with God&lt;/i&gt; presents opposing perspectives on the issue of homosexuality and gives a clear portrait of the gap dividing the body of believers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advance Praise for &lt;i&gt;Arguing with God&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hutcherson is a light in the spiritual and religious darkness. He offers an analytical offensivea loving and informed response to Christian fundamentalism. Using weapons of theological knowledge and mature discourse, he faces the ultimate challenge of The Other and gives answers to young Christians and adults estranged from the ordinary. He not only finds a place for himself, but becomes a model for all those disenfranchised and criticized the world around.&lt;/p&gt;
