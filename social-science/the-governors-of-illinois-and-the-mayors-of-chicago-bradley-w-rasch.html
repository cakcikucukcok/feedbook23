&lt;p&gt;In this study, author Bradley W. Rasch explores the history of the state, its politics, and its power brokers and details little-known facts about some of the important people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Edward Coles, who served as governor from 1822 to 1826, was an abolitionist long before it was fashionable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Gov. Joseph Duncans (18341838) major accomplishment was moving the state capital to Springfield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	William Ogden is called Chicagos founder and served as the first mayor after its incorporation, which he helped facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;	Mayor Augustus Garrett served as mayor twice but is best known for having his second election invalidated due to fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
