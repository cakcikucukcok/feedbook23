  <title>Living Beyond the Borders - Edward Shizha, Rosemary Kimani-Dupuis, Priscilla Broni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Cross-border migration has resulted in many social, cultural, economic, and political challenges that need attention. Globalization, migration, and transnationalism have a strong impact on the lives of diasporic immigrants and refugees. Transnationalism and diaspora, which result from globalization and migration, create transnational social spaces, fields, and formations that affect the everyday practices and engagements of migrants and refugees. &lt;I&gt;Living Beyond the Borders&lt;/I&gt; highlights the Canadian immigration policies and the challenges faced by migrants, particularly visible minorities. The book further presents multiple perspectives and arguments on how immigrants and refugees react to their &quot;new home&quot; in the north and how they maintain memories of their country of origin.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The contributors to this volume analyze the impact of transnational lives on the identity construction of migrants and how they acquire and negotiate their multiple identities. The book further interrogates these identities by questioning the experiences of immigrants and refugees living precarious lives in their country of permanent or temporary settlement. This book contributes knowledge and literature that is intended for academic scholars, researchers, and undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of immigration studies, global studies, sociology, political science, development studies, and interdisciplinary studies. Its multidisciplinary approach has significant value to readers, as it integrates perspectives on the multidimensionality and complexity of transnational migration, settlement, and integration in the contemporary globalized world.&lt;/P&gt;" />
