  <title>Dressed Up for a Riot - Michael Idov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A memoir of revolution, reaction, and Russian men&#39;s fashion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this crackling memoir, the journalist and novelist Michael Idov recounts the tempestuous years he spent living alongside--and closely observing--the media and cultural elite of Putin&#39;s Russia. After accepting a surprise offer to become the editor in chief of &lt;i&gt;GQ Russia&lt;/i&gt;, Idov and his family arrive in a Moscow still seething from a dubious election and the mass anti-Putin rallies that erupted in response. Idov is fascinated by the political turmoil but nonetheless finds himself pulled in unlikely directions. He becomes a tabloid celebrity, acts in a Russian movie with Snoop Dogg, befriends the members of Pussy Riot, punches an anti-Semitic magazine editor on the steps of the Bolshoi Theatre, sells an autobiographical sitcom pilot that is later changed into an anti-American farce, and writes Russia&#39;s top-grossing domestic movie of 2015. Meanwhile, he becomes disillusioned with the splintering opposition to Putin and is briefly attracted to a kind of jaded Putinism lite--until Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine thoroughly changes his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Dressed Up for a Riot&lt;/i&gt;, Idov writes openly, sensitively, and stingingly about life in Moscow and his place in a media apparatus that sometimes undermined but more often bolstered a state system defined by cynicism, corruption, and the fanning of fake news. With humor and intelligence, he offers a close-up glimpse of what a declining world power can become.&lt;/p&gt;" />
