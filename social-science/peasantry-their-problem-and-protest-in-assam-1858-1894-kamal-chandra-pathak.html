  <title>Peasantry Their Problem and Protest in Assam (1858-1894) - Kamal Chandra Pathak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book especially deals with the peasant unrest and uprisings in the erstwhile three districts of Assam viz. Kamrup, Darrang, and Nowgong from 1858 to 1894. The year 1858 has been taken as a starting point, as it has a special importance in the history of the British India. After the Great Mutiny of 1857, Assam, like other parts of India, went into the hands of the British Crown in 1858. The colonial government decided to augment the rate of revenue on land from this year with a view to meet their loss in the Great Mutiny. Hence, this year may be termed as the confrontation Year between the peasants and the government, which continued up to 1894 and even beyond that. The peasant unrest of Assam has fetched some new aspects into focus, and some of them has been referred herein proper places. The specific period (185894) has yet not been studied, albeit lots have been done in this field. It is because of that that it has received not due attention as is given to the same phenomena in other parts of India. This work is an endeavor to give as far as possible a comprehensive, accessible, and crystal picture of a series of complex scenario." />
