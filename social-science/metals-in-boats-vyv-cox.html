  <title>Metals in Boats - Vyv Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Metals have been used in boats for thousands of years, as components of the vessel&#39;s construction, as load-bearing parts of the rigging and steering systems, and for a wide variety of domestic and service duties.  Due to misunderstandings of the properties of the metals used, and in some cases to questionable design and manufacture, there have been spectacular and sometimes tragic failures of boats&#39; metalworking.  These continue even today.  This new book explains in layman&#39;s terms how a wide variety of metal alloys may best be selected, formed and manufactured to give optimum performance in the typical conditions of a sailing or powered vessel.  Subjects as wide-ranging as anodes, batteries, hulls, skin fittings and rigging components are described in detail, enabling the boat owner to select the preferred material for his vessel. This practical and instructional book will be of great interest to sailors, boat owners and those involved in boat maintenance, and is fully illustrated with 90 colour photographs and 20 diagrams." />
