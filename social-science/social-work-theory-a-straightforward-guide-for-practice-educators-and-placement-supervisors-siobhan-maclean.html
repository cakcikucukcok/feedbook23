  <title>Social Work Theory: A Straightforward Guide for Practice Educators and Placement Supervisors - Siobhan Maclean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Social work students need to be able to link theory to their practice on placement. The need to support students in this area often causes anxiety for practice educators and placement supervisors. The first edition of this book was used widely by practice educators in supporting student learning in relation to theory and practice. It was so popular that many students started to use the book themselves - in response we published another book written specifically for students &quot;Theory and Practice: A Straightforward Guide for Social Work Students&quot;. This all new edition of Social Work Theory still begins by introducing the concept of theory and practice, reminding practice educators and supervisors about the ways in which they use and apply theory every day in some aspect of their practice. Ideas are given on exercises to assist students in developing their own understanding of the use of theory in their practice. Subsequent sections briefly outline some of the key social work theories and models which will apply to any practice learning environment. Suggestions for further reading are provided throughout the text as are ideas for exercises to use with students. This second edition sees the inclusion of some newer theories and models such as the McDonaldization of social work. All the chapters have been reviewed and updated and more recent thinking on the theories and models is included. Siobhan Maclean has been a practice educator since 1992. She has worked with more than 200 students since then, mostly as an independent off site practice educator. Siobhan continues to learn from students every day. Rob Harrison has worked in several voluntary sector settings since 1996. He completed his Practice Teaching Award in 2007 and has enjoyed working with several social work students as an on site practice educator and supervisor." />
