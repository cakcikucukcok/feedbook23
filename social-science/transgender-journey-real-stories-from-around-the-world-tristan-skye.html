  <title>Transgender Journey: Real Stories from Around the World - Tristan Skye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="*Digital Version* In January 2015, I asked 10 questions. These questions were answered by Transgender / Gender Queer individuals from all around the world that included: all walks of life, all shapes, sizes and ages with different beliefs and life experiences. I had no idea the profound responses I would receive. This book is an intricate look inside the personal lives of almost 40 people located in countries spanning from the United States all the way to small dot on the map called Slovenia. The words inside this book reach into the depths of the soul, awakening anyone who picks it up to read. This book is perfect for those who are new to the journey, for family and friends who want to learn more, or for anyone who loves reading about the fascinating journeys of others. You may laugh, you may cry. No doubt this book will make a lasting impression in your mind (and heart) for years to come. Real Stories. Real Lives. Real Answers." />
