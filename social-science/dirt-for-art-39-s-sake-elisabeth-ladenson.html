  <title>Dirt for Art&#39;s Sake - Elisabeth Ladenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;em&gt;Dirt for Art&#39;s Sake&lt;/em&gt;, Elisabeth Ladenson recounts the most visible of modern obscenity trials involving scandalous books and their authors. What, she asks, do these often-colorful legal histories have to tell us about the works themselves and about a changing cultural climate that first treated them as filth and later celebrated them as masterpieces?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ladenson&#39;s narrative starts with &lt;em&gt;Madame Bovary&lt;/em&gt; (Flaubert was tried in France in 1857) and finishes with &lt;em&gt;Fanny Hill &lt;/em&gt;(written in the eighteenth century, put on trial in the United States in 1966); she considers, along the way, Les Fleurs du Mal, &lt;em&gt;Ulysses&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Well of Loneliness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lady Chatterley&#39;s Lover&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tropic of Cancer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt;, and the works of the Marquis de Sade. Over the course of roughly a century, Ladenson finds, two ideas that had been circulating in the form of avant-garde heresy gradually became accepted as truisms, and eventually as grounds for legal defense. The first is captured in the formula &quot;art for art&#39;s sake&quot;-the notion that a work of art exists in a realm independent of conventional morality. The second is realism, vilified by its critics as &quot;dirt for dirt&#39;s sake.&quot; In Ladenson&#39;s view, the truth of the matter is closer to -dirt for art&#39;s sake-&quot;the idea that the work of art may legitimately include the representation of all aspects of life, including the unpleasant and the sordid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Ladenson also considers cinematic adaptations of these novels, among them Vincente Minnelli&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Madame Bovary&lt;/em&gt;, Stanley Kubrick&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Lolita&lt;/em&gt; and the 1997 remake directed by Adrian Lyne, and various attempts to translate de Sade&#39;s works and life into film, which faced similar censorship travails. Written with a keen awareness of ongoing debates about free speech, &lt;em&gt;Dirt for Art&#39;s Sake&lt;/em&gt; traces the legal and social acceptance of controversial works with critical acumen and delightful wit." />
