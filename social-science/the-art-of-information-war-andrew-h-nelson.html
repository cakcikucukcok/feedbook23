  <title>The Art of Information War - Andrew H. Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first edition of this book was published in 1995.  At that time, a very limited number were printed, with a very closed and exclusive distribution of those prints, in order to communicate and share first principles as we  developed our capabilities. There are eternal principles of war that endure through time, technology, concepts of operation, and organizational change.   This is a book of first principles.  It is for the reader to judge if these principles of war still ring true.
For those of us with the first copy of the book, I salute you for your quiet dedication to the service of your country.   We are well prepared now, thanks to you, for the wars we are fighting now in this domain.
For our enemies, read this and learn.   It will help you improve, definitely, but it should give you pause. We were light years ahead of where you are now,  in 1995, and weve had all this time to improve.   Be warned." />
