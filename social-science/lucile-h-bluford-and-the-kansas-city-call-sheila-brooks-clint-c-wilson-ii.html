  <title>Lucile H. Bluford and the Kansas City Call - Sheila Brooks, Clint C. Wilson Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book on publisher and editor Lucile H. Bluford examines her journalistic writings on social, economic, and political issues; her strong opinionated views on African Americans and women; and whether there were consistent themes, biases, and assumptions in her stories that may have influenced news coverage in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Kansas City Call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It traces the beginnings of her activism as a young reporter seeking admission to the graduate program in journalism at the University of Missouri and how her admissions rejection became the catalyst for her seven-decade career as a champion of racial and gender equality. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Bluford&amp;rsquo;s work at the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Kansas City Call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; demonstrates how critical theorists used storytelling to describe personal experiences of struggle and oppression to inform the public of racial and gender consciousness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Lucile H. Bluford and the&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; Kansas City Call illustrates how she used her social authority in the formidable power base of the weekly Black newspaper she owned, shaping and mobilizing a broader movement in the fight for freedom and social justice. This book focuses on a selection of Bluford&amp;rsquo;s news stories and editorials from 1968 to 1983 as examples of how she articulated a Black feminist standpoint advocating a Black liberation agenda&amp;mdash;equal access to decent jobs, affordable health care and housing, and a better education in Kansas City, Missouri. Bluford&amp;rsquo;s writings represented what the mainstream news ignored, exposing injustices and inequalities in the African American community and among feminists.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
