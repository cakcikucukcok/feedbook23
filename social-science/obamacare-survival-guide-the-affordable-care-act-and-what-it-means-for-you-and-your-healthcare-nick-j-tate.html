  <title>ObamaCare Survival Guide: The Affordable Care Act and What It Means for You and Your Healthcare - Nick J. Tate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, he handed Americans one of the most sweeping pieces of social legislation in U.S. history. Now that the Supreme Court has upheld ObamaCare, it is imperative that the American people understand the overwhelming impact it will have on their lives. The Affordable Care Act totals more than 2,700 pages and comprises nearly 500 provisions. For the first time, Humanix Books provides an easy-to-read guide to the law and its implications for every American. The ObamaCare Survival Guide: The Affordable Care Act and What It Means for You and Your Healthcare is the first guide book to help Americans understand the intricacies of ObamaCare. It serves as a valuable resource for those currently insured, those who are not, and the tens of millions of seniors, youth, business people and others who will be affected by the new law. The ObamaCare Survival Guide reveals: · How the currently insured will be affected, including rising premium costs · Medicare shocker: cuts in benefits, new rules · New protections for the uninsured · Hidden fees and levies · New taxes for the affluent · Small businesses, new requirements, tax credits · Prescription drug users: new fees · A timetable for each part of the healthcare plan · Essential benefits insurance companies must provide · ObamaCare&#39;s impact on long-term care · Your responsibilities and penalties under the new laws · How to maximize your healthcare dollar on the new plan · The cost to you as a consumer · And much, much more..." />
