  <title>Constitution for a Free People, for City, County, Provincial, State and National Governments - Douglas Robinson Buck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Constitution for a Free People presents all the principles and tools needed to create a charter for freedom for any government: city, county, state, nation, or colony on the Moon or Mars.
It is based on the inspired original Constitution for the United States, with worthy safeguards to secure liberty for the people and curb the growth of power by any person or special group.
It assumes that men and women are born free and that most, when they arrive at the years of majority, are able to come together, deliberate on their common needs, and solve problems.
It hails the U.S. Constitution as a charter of liberty and shows how the ideas behind its creation can become the basis for any government. Many statements from the Founders of the United States are given in support.
This is not a history book, although some history is included.  It is not a political science tome, although may be used as a handbook for students and statesmen.  It is not a political tract, although conservative by nature.  And it is not a novel or fiction.
It is a plan for a government of the people, by the people and for the people, a plan to keep most political decision making close to home, a plan to secure for all people their best hope for liberty, prosperity and happiness." />
