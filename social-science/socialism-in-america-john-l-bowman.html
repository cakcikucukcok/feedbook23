  <title>Socialism in America - John L. Bowman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville predicted a &quot; species of oppression [with] which democratic nations are menaced unlike anything which ever before existed in the world &quot; It was a despotism that &quot; would be more extensive and would degrade men without tormenting them.&quot; It would be a force that &quot; compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a people, till each is reduced to be nothing better than a flock of timid animals, of which the government is the shepherd.&quot; Tocqueville was predicting socialism in America, a new form of oppression that did not exist in his time. He could not name it at the time because the word socialism had not yet appeared in the English language and Karl Marx had not yet published his &lt;i&gt;Communist Manifesto&lt;/i&gt;. America has become a socialist state and &lt;i&gt;Socialism in America&lt;/i&gt; is about what socialism is doing to America today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Socialism is an oppression that has caused America to discard the rule of law, forsake justice, limit freedom, attenuate individuality, create dependence, degrade social norms, attack sources of wealth, and divide the culture. This form of despotic totalitarianism has irreversibly commenced the destruction of American culture and nation. &lt;i&gt;Socialism in America&lt;/i&gt; offers the reader the perspective of how and why this is happening. It explains the history of socialism, and in particular the history of socialism in America. It discusses the roles of socialism&#39;s foremost vectors, which are primarily the unions and Democratic Party. It critically dissects the philosophy of socialism itself and examines other countries&#39; struggles to survive under the heavy socialist boot. Every freedom-loving American should read &lt;i&gt;Socialism in America&lt;/i&gt;." />
