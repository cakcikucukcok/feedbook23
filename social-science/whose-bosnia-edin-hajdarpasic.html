  <title>Whose Bosnia? - Edin Hajdarpasic</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the site of the assassination that triggered World War I and the place where the term &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; was invented during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, Bosnia has become a global symbol of nationalist conflict and ethnic division. But as Edin Hajdarpasic shows, formative contestations over the region began well before 1914, emerging with the rise of new nineteenth-century forces—Serbian and Croatian nationalisms as well as Ottoman, Habsburg, Muslim, and Yugoslav political movements—that claimed this province as their own. &lt;em&gt;Whose Bosnia?&lt;/em&gt; reveals the political pressures and moral arguments that made this land a prime target of escalating nationalist activity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To explain the remarkable proliferation of national movements since the nineteenth century, Hajdarpasic draws on a vast range of sources—records of secret societies, imperial surveillance files, poetry, paintings, personal correspondences—spanning Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia, Turkey, and Austria. Challenging conventional readings of Balkan histories, &lt;em&gt;Whose Bosnia?&lt;/em&gt; provides new insight into central themes of modern politics, illuminating core subjects like &quot;the people,&quot; state-building, and national suffering. Hajdarpasic uses South Slavic debates over Bosnian Muslim identity to propose a new figure in the history of nationalism: the &lt;em&gt;(br)other&lt;/em&gt;, a character signifying at the same time the potential of being both &quot;brother&quot; and “Other,” containing the fantasy of both complete assimilation and insurmountable difference. By bringing such figures into focus, &lt;em&gt;Whose Bosnia?&lt;/em&gt; shows nationalism to be an immensely dynamic and open-ended force, one that eludes any clear sense of historical closure.&lt;/p&gt;" />
