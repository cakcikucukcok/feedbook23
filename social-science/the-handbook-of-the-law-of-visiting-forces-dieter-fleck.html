  <title>The Handbook of the Law of Visiting Forces - Dieter Fleck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The legal position of visiting forces transcends domestic and international law and is of growing importance in our increasingly globalized and insecure world. &#39;In area&#39; and &#39;out of area&#39; operations, both for the purpose of establishing and maintaining peace and in connection with the conduct of other military operations and training, are likely to become more frequent for a variety of reasons. Finding where the applicable law places the balance between the
interests, sensitivities and needs of the host state and the requirements, often practical in nature, of the visiting force is a key objective in ensuring that the relationship between hosts and &#39;guests&#39; is and remains harmonious. All of this must be achieved in an increasingly complex legal environment.
This fully updated second edition of The Handbook of the Law of Visiting Forces addresses the issues surrounding visiting forces and provides a full overview of the legal framework in which they operate. Through an analysis of jurisprudence and historical developments, it offers a comparative commentary to the UN, NATO, and other SOFA rules. The Handbook then continues its analysis through cases studies of visiting forces in key countries, including a fully updated chapter on Iraq that
considers the various stages of the conflict with withdrawal and then reintroduction of forces, before offering conclusions on the current state of the law and its likely future development." />
