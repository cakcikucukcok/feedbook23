  <title>Up in Arms - John Temple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;IT&amp;rsquo;S TIME! They have my cattle and now they have one of my boys. Range War begins tomorrow at Bundy Ranch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These words, pounded out on a laptop at Cliven Bundy&amp;rsquo;s besieged Nevada ranch on April 6, 2014, ignited a new American revolution. Across the country, a certain type of citizen snapped to attention: This was the flashpoint the they&amp;rsquo;d been waiting for, a chance to help a fellow American stand up to a tyrannical and corrupt federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Up in Arms&lt;/em&gt; chronicles how an isolated clan of desert-dwelling Mormons became the guiding light&amp;mdash;and then the outright leaders&amp;mdash;of America&amp;rsquo;s Patriot movement. The nation was riveted in 2014, when hundreds of armed Bundy supporters forced federal agents to abandon a court-ordered cattle roundup in the largest gathering of government-loathing organizations the FBI had ever witnessed. Then, in 2016, Ammon Bundy, one of Cliven&amp;rsquo;s 13 children, led a 41-day armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those events and the subsequent shootings, arrests, and trials captured headlines, but they&amp;rsquo;re just part of a story that has never been fully told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Temple, award-winning journalist and author of &lt;em&gt;American Pain&lt;/em&gt;, gives readers an unprecedented and objective look at the real people and families at the heart of this highly publicized standoff. Eye-opening and instantly gripping,&lt;em&gt; Up in Arms&lt;/em&gt; offers a propulsive and thoroughly researched narrative populated by rifle-toting cowboys, apocalyptic militiamen, undercover infiltrators, and the devout and charismatic Bundys themselves. In its main storyline, the book chronicles Ammon Bundy&amp;rsquo;s transformation from successful Phoenix businessman to the leader of an armed insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In engrossing and plainspoken prose, Temple uses the Bundy family&amp;rsquo;s story to illuminate the rise of the Patriot militia movement in America. A seasoned investigative reporter, Temple embedded himself in a corner of the West where many citizens believe they&amp;rsquo;re treated like colonial subjects, not full-fledged Americans. Neither mainstream nor conservative media outlets have contextualized the religious, political, environmental, and economic factors, decades in the making, that set the stage for these events. &lt;em&gt;Up In Arms&lt;/em&gt; presents the Bundys and their supporters as they truly are: neither violent criminals nor folk heroes, but a diverse collection of American rebels who believe government overreach justifies the taking up of arms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
