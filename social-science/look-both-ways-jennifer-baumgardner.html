  <title>Look Both Ways - Jennifer Baumgardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the acclaimed author and activist Jennifer Baumgardner, bisexuality has always been more than the &quot;sexual non-preference of the &#39;90s.&quot; In &lt;i&gt;Look Both Ways&lt;/i&gt;, Baumgardner takes a close look at the growing visibility of gay and bisexual characters, performers, and issues on the national cultural stage. Despite the prevalence of bisexuality among Generation X and Y women, she finds that it continues to be marginalized by both gay and straight cultures, and dismissed either as a phase or a cop-out. With intimacy and humor, Baumgardner discusses her own experience as a bisexual, and the struggle she&#39;s undergone to reconcile the privilege she&#39;s garnered as a woman who is perceived as straight and the empowerment and satisfaction she&#39;s derived from her relationships with women.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part memoir, part pop-culture study, &lt;i&gt;Look Both Ways &lt;/i&gt;connects the prominent dots of a bisexual community (Alix Kates Shulman, Ani DiFranco, Rebecca Walker, and, of course, Anne Heche) that Baumgardner argues have bridged feminist aims with those of the gay rights movement. &lt;i&gt;Look Both Ways &lt;/i&gt;is a compelling and current study in bisexual lives lived secretly and openly, and an exploration of the lessons learned by writers, artists, and activists who have refused the either/or paradigm defended by both gay and straight communities.&lt;/p&gt;" />
