  <title>First, Do No Harm: The President&#39;s Cousin Explains Why His Hippocratic Oath Requires Him to Oppose ObamaCare - Milton Wolf, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New from Broadside Books&#39; Voices of the Tea Party.&lt;/strong&gt; The discussion what role&amp;#8212;if any&amp;#8212;the government should play in regulating and dictating the delivery of health care in the United States has become ground zero in the much larger age-old struggle between statism and individual liberty. Personifying this struggle is the conflict between the big government schemes of President Barack Obama and the free market principles of the President&#39;s own cousin, the private practice physician Milton R. Wolf, M.D. When Barack Obama and Dr. Milton Wolf met for the first time in May 2010, it marked the beginning of a new phase in this all-American family feud. In this work, Dr. Wolf takes the gloves off and describes the results of decades of government intervention in health care, the disastrous doubling down on failure of ObamaCare and finally the alternative free market reforms that will save our system and ultimately our nation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
