  <title>The Girl From Kathmandu - Cam Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Book Review Editor&#39;s Choice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shocking story of the massacre of a group of Nepalese men working as Defense contractors for the United States Government during the Iraq War, and the widow who dedicated her life to finding justice for her husband and the other victims&amp;#8212;a riveting tale of courageous heroes, corporate war profiteers, international business, exploitation, trafficking, and human rights in the age of global capitalism that reveals how modern power truly works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August of 2004, twelve men left their village in Nepal for jobs at a five-star luxury hotel in Amman, Jordan. They had no idea that they had actually been hired for sub-contract work on an American military base in Iraq. But fate took an even darker turn when the dozen men were kidnapped and murdered by Islamic extremists. Their gruesome deaths were captured in one of the first graphic execution videos disseminated on the web&amp;#8212;the largest massacre of contractors during the war. Compounding the tragedy, their deaths received little notice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why were these men, from a remote country far removed from the war, in Iraq? How had they gotten there? Who were they working for? Consumed by these questions, award-winning investigative journalist Cam Simpson embarked on a journey to find answers, a decade-long odyssey that would uncover a web of evil spanning the globe&amp;#8212;and trigger a chain of events involving one brave young widow, three indefatigable human rights lawyers, and a formidable multinational corporation with deep governmental ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A heart-rending, page-turning narrative that moves from the Himalayas to the Middle East to Houston and culminates in an epic court battle,&lt;em&gt; The Girl from Kathmandu&lt;/em&gt; is a story of death and life&amp;#8212;of the war in Iraq, the killings of the twelve Nepalese, a journalist determined to uncover the truth, and a trio of human rights lawyers dedicated to finding justice. At its heart is one unforgettable young woman, Kamala Magar, who found the courage to face the influential men who sent her husband to his death&amp;#8212;a model of strength hope, bravery, and an unbreakable spirit who reminds us of the power we all have to make a difference.&lt;/p&gt;" />
