  <title>New Challenges for Maturing Democracies in Korea and Taiwan - Larry Diamond, Gi-Wook Shin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;New Challenges for Maturing Democracies in Korea and Taiwan&lt;/I&gt; takes a creative and comparative view of the new challenges and dynamics confronting these maturing democracies. 
Numerous works deal with political change in the two societies individually, but few adopt a comparative approach—and most focus mainly on the emergence of democracy or the politics of the democratization processes. This book, utilizing a broad, interdisciplinary approach, pays careful attention to post-democratization phenomena and the key issues that arise in maturing democracies. 
What emerges is a picture of two evolving democracies, now secure, but still imperfect and at times disappointing to their citizens—a common feature and challenge of democratic maturation. The book demonstrates that it will fall to the elected political leaders of these two countries to rise above narrow and immediate party interests to mobilize consensus and craft policies that will guide the structural adaptation and reinvigoration of the society and economy in an era that clearly presents for both countries not only steep challenges but also new opportunities." />
