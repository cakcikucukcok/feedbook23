  <title>China&#39;s Great Train - Abrahm Lustgarten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A vivid account of China&#39;s unstoppable quest to build a railway into Tibet, and its obsession to transform its land and its people&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2006, the Chinese government fulfilled a fifty-year plan to build a railway into Tibet. Since Mao Zedong first envisioned it, the line had grown into an imperative, a critical component of China&#39;s breakneck expansion and the final maneuver in strengthening China&#39;s grip over this remote and often mystical frontier, which promised rich resources and geographic supremacy over South Asia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the lives of the Chinese and Tibetans swept up in the project, &lt;i&gt;Fortune&lt;/i&gt; magazine writer Abrahm Lustgarten explores the &quot;Wild West&quot; atmosphere of the Chinese economy today. He follows innovative Chinese engineer Zhang Luxin as he makes the train&#39;s route over the treacherous mountains and permafrost possible (for now), and the tenacious Tibetan shopkeeper Rinzen, who struggles to hold on to his business in a boomtown that increasingly favors the Han Chinese. As the railway--the highest and steepest in the world--extends to Lhasa, and China&#39;s &quot;Go West&quot; campaign delivers waves of rural poor eager to make their fortunes, their lives and communities fundamentally change, sometimes for good, sometimes not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lustgarten&#39;s book is a timely, provocative, and absorbing first-hand account of the Chinese boom and the promise and costs of rapid development on the country&#39;s people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
