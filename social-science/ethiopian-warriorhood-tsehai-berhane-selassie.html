  <title>Ethiopian Warriorhood - Tsehai Berhane-Selassie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Today best known for their role in defending Ethiopia from Italian invasion 1935-41, when more than 7,000 fought against colonial forces, chewa warriors protected Ethiopia for centuries. Yet, depictedby some 19th-century Western observers as little more than &quot;a horde&quot; of warmongers, and later suppressed by Ethiopian monarchs who sought to create a centralized modern state, their contribution hasbeen neglected. Drawing on oral and written sources, as well as the &lt;I&gt;zeraf&lt;/I&gt; poetry through which they expressed themselves, this book explores for the first time in depth the history, practices and principles of warriorhood of the &lt;I&gt;chewa&lt;/I&gt;, and their wider influence on society and state. Often self-trained individuals who began by defending their communities, by the end of the 19th century there were &lt;I&gt;chewa&lt;/I&gt;warrior groups from almost all linguistic groups who fought together to resist foreign invaders. Some &lt;I&gt;chewa&lt;/I&gt; enrolled in the service of the Ethiopian &quot;kings of kings&quot;, who organized them as named corps that supplemented the formal defence of the state. Today, &lt;I&gt;chewa&lt;/I&gt; political identity, which transcended social, familial, political and other groupings, remains deeply rooted in Ethiopian society.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Tsehai Berhane-Selassie taught Social Anthropology, Gender and Development Studies in universities in Ethiopia, the UK, the USA and Ireland. She is a member of The Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton. Her publications include editing &lt;I&gt;Gender Issues in Ethiopia&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
