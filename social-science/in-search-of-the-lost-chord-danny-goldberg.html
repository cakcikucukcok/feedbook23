  <title>In Search of the Lost Chord - Danny Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;Danny Goldberg is a relentless tracker of people. However elusive this Lost Chord may be, Danny G. searches it out and nails it to the tree flesh. Eternity now! 1967 forever!&quot;&lt;BR&gt; --&lt;B&gt;Wavy Gravy&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Danny Goldberg&amp;#8217;s deeply personal and political history of 1967 and the hippie idea weaves together rollicking, rousing, wonderfully colorful and disparate narratives to remind us how the energies and aspirations of the counterculture were intertwined with protest and reform. There is a direct line from many of the events, movements, and people of 1967 to our times.

It is, he writes in the introduction, &amp;#147;an attempt at trying to remember the culture that mesmerized me, to visit the places and conversations I was not cool enough to have been a part of.&amp;#8221; It is also a refreshing and new analysis of the era; by looking at not only the political causes, but also the spiritual, musical, and psychedelic movements, Goldberg provides a unique perspective on how and why the legacy of 1967 lives on today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1967 was the year of the release of the Beatles&amp;#8217;s &lt;I&gt;Sgt. Pepper&amp;#8217;s Lonely Hearts Club Band,&lt;/I&gt; and of debut albums from the Doors, the Grateful Dead, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, among many others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In addition to the thriving music scene, 1967 was also the year of the Summer of Love; the year that millions of now-illegal LSD tabs flooded America; Muhammad Ali was convicted of avoiding the draft; Martin Luther King Jr. publicly opposed the war in Vietnam; Stokely Carmichael championed Black Power; Israel won the Six-Day War, and Che Guevara was murdered. It was the year that hundreds of thousands of protesters vainly attempted to levitate the Pentagon. It was the year the word &amp;#147;hippie&amp;#8221; peaked and died, and the Yippies were born.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Exhaustively researched and informed by interviews with Allen Ginsberg, Timothy Leary, Ram Dass, Tom Hayden, Cora Weiss, and Gil Scott-Heron (one of many of Goldberg&amp;#8217;s high school classmates who entered the culture), &lt;I&gt;In Search of the Lost Chord&lt;/I&gt; is a mosaic of seminal moments in the psychedelic, spiritual, rock-and-roll, and political protest cultures of 1967.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Dispatches from the Culture Wars: How the Left Lost Teen Spirit&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Years from now, if the Democrats have long faded from American memory, anthropologists and historians will ask, Didn&amp;#8217;t any of them read this book by Danny Goldberg?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;B&gt;Michael Moore&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Praise for &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;Bumping into Geniuses&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Goldberg believes in the transcendental power and beauty of rock and roll and at the same time has a unique perspective on the business which has presented and preserved it.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--&lt;B&gt;Patti Smith&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
