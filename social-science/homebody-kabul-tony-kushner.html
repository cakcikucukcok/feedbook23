  <title>Homebody/Kabul - Tony Kushner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;Mr. Kushner&amp;#8217;s glorious specialty is in giving theatrical life to internal points of view, in which our thoughts meld with a character&amp;#8217;s wayward speculations or fantasies... He makes the personal and the universal, the trivial and the cosmic come simultaneously to life in a single character&amp;#8217;s bewilderment.&amp;#8221; &amp;#150;Ben Brantley,&lt;I&gt; New York Times&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;An extraordinary play&amp;#133;a deeply felt, expansively ruminative drama.&amp;#8221; &amp;#150;Paul Taylor, &lt;I&gt;Independent&lt;/I&gt; (London)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;What a feast of a play. No playwright in the English language has a greater passion for language than Kushner. And to this Kushner adds that rare quality in American theater, a yearning to go beyond domestic stories and into the great world of political struggle. Brilliant. It keeps us thinking.&amp;#8221; &amp;#150;Richard Christiansen, &lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;This eerily timely work about Afghanistan is comparably mesmerizing and mournful, vast and intimate, emotionally generous and stylistically fabulist, wildly verbal, politically progressive and scarily well informed.&amp;#8221; &amp;#150;Linda Winer, &lt;I&gt;Newsday&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Homebody/Kabul&lt;/I&gt;, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner, author of &lt;I&gt;Angels in America&lt;/I&gt;, has turned his penetrating gaze to the arena of global politics to create this suspenseful portrait of a dangerous collision between cultures. Written before 9/11, &lt;I&gt;Homebody/Kabul&lt;/I&gt; premiered in New York in December 2001 and has had highly successful productions in London, Providence, Seattle, Chicago and Los Angeles. This version incorporates all the playwright&#39;s changes and is now the definitive version of the text.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Tony Kushner&lt;/B&gt;&amp;#8217;s plays include &lt;I&gt;Angels in America&lt;/I&gt;; &lt;I&gt;Hydriotaphia, or the Death of Dr. Brown&lt;/I&gt;; &lt;I&gt;The Illusion&lt;/I&gt;, adapted from the play by Pierre Corneille; &lt;I&gt;Slavs!&lt;/I&gt;; &lt;I&gt;A Bright Room Called Day&lt;/I&gt;; &lt;I&gt;Homebody/Kabul&lt;/I&gt;;&lt;I&gt; Caroline, or Change&lt;/I&gt;, a musical with composer Jeanine Tesori; and &lt;I&gt;The Intelligent Homosexual&amp;#8217;s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures&lt;/I&gt;. He wrote the screenplays for Mike Nichols&amp;#8217;s film of &lt;I&gt;Angels in America&lt;/I&gt; and for Steven Spielberg&amp;#8217;s &lt;I&gt;Munich&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Lincoln&lt;/I&gt;. His books include&lt;I&gt; The Art of Maurice Sendak: 1980 to the Present; Brundibar&lt;/I&gt;, with illustrations by Maurice Sendak; and &lt;I&gt;Wrestling with Zion: Progressive Jewish-American Responses to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict&lt;/I&gt;, co-edited with Alisa Solomon.&lt;br&gt;Among many honors, Kushner is the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, two Tony Awards, three Obie Awards, two Evening Standard Awards, an Olivier Award, an Emmy Award, two Oscar nominations, and the Steinberg Distinguished Playwright Award. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 2012, he was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President Barack Obama.
