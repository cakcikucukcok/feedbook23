  <title>The Call for African Pride - Zandile Dlamini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about two of the most prominent leaders of South Africa, leaders whose respective roles shaped and influenced South Africa, both positively and negatively. Those leaders were Dr H. F. Verwoerd, better known historically as an architect of apartheid, and Nelson Mandela, the doctor of the soul, known for his peace and reconciliation policy. Verwoerd was a doctor of psychology, a profession he used to his advantage to cripple the minds of black men; hence black people are still suffering even in the new dispensation from inferiority complex strongly argued in the book by the author. 
The author is appreciatively of these two heads of state, who came from different backgrounds. Verwoerd had no regard whatsoever for black people, but in many other ways, he was much like Mandela in character and reasoning capacity. What cannot be disputed about these two remarkable leaders is that they both created a rich history for South Africa, which we owe to both Dr Nelson Mandela and Dr H. F. VerwoerdVerwoerd with his apartheid policy and Mandela with his peace and reconciliation policy. 
Both had strong characters, being idealists and philosophers in their own rights, men who stood for what they believed in and held firm to their convictions, knowing that greater success comes with pain and at a high price. Where they differed was in their outlook on life. Ones focus of interest was a minority group (whites), while Mandelas was on all races, including both blacks and whites. Hence, he received the title of Father of the Nation, while Verwoerd was the god of the white people only. 
So the book shall take you on a journey of how these great mens ideals and beliefs had influenced the people of South Africa and the world in general and how detrimental was the policy of apartheid in the lives of many who until this day and age are still struggling to detached themselves from that belief of inferiority. They were taught by apartheid and Dr Verwoerd that it defines their existence and that belief keeps holding back the millions of black African people from forging ahead in order to be the greatest they can be as proud Africans, irrespective of the way forward presented to them by Dr Nelson Mandela. There is a star and a hero in every one of us, so the book is taking everyone on a journey to self-discovery and pride in their own identity." />
