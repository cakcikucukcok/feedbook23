  <title>Excavating Modernity - Joshua Arthurs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The cultural and material legacies of the Roman Republic and Empire in evidence throughout Rome have made it the &quot;Eternal City.&quot; Too often, however, this patrimony has caused Rome to be seen as static and antique, insulated from the transformations of the modern world. In &lt;em&gt;Excavating Modernity&lt;/em&gt;, Joshua Arthurs dramatically revises this perception, arguing that as both place and idea, Rome was strongly shaped by a radical vision of modernity imposed by Mussolini&#39;s regime between the two world wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Italian Fascism&#39;s appropriation of the Roman past-the idea of Rome, or &lt;em&gt;romanità&lt;/em&gt;- encapsulated the Fascist virtues of discipline, hierarchy, and order; the Fascist &quot;new man&quot; was modeled on the Roman legionary, the epitome of the virile citizen-soldier. This vision of modernity also transcended Italy&#39;s borders, with the Roman Empire providing a foundation for Fascism&#39;s own vision of Mediterranean domination and a European New Order. At the same time, romanità also served as a vocabulary of anxiety about modernity. Fears of population decline, racial degeneration and revolution were mapped onto the barbarian invasions and the fall of Rome. Offering a critical assessment of &lt;em&gt;romanità&lt;/em&gt; and its effects, Arthurs explores the ways in which academics, officials, and ideologues approached Rome not as a site of distant glories but as a blueprint for contemporary life, a source of dynamic values to shape the present and future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
