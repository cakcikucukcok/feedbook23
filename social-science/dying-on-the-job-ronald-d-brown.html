  <title>Dying on the Job - Ronald D. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Dying on the Job &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is the first book on workplace violence to focus exclusively on workplace &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;murder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;. While some perpetrators are certainly mentally impaired, many workplace murders are committed by people considered to be &amp;ldquo;normal.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Brown explores the various motives and drives that spark workplace murder, and answers hundreds of questions that are usually asked only after a workplace murder rampage has already occurred. Are men or women more likely to commit workplace homicide? How can people more easily spot those likely to commit workplace murder? What are some of the warning signs? How often is &amp;quot;suicide&amp;quot; used as workplace revenge? The answers to these questions and more are based on more than 350 actual cases of workplace murder, and the answers are often surprising. Brown also addresses different areas of prevention, counseling, and rehabilitation, and analyzes different approaches to gun control for both management and employees to make their job a safer place to work.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
