  <title>Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work - Mo Yee Lee, Celia C. H. Y. Chan, Cecilia L. W. Chan, Siu-Man Ng...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Integrative therapy focuses on the mind-body-spirit relationship, recognizes spirituality as a fundamental domain of human existence, acknowledges and utilizes the mind&#39;s power as well as the body&#39;s, and reaches beyond self-actualization or symptom reduction to broaden a perception of self that connects individuals to a larger sense of themselves and to their communities.
When it was published in 2009, &lt;em&gt;Integrative Body-Mind-Spirit Social Work&lt;/em&gt; was the first book to strongly connect Western therapeutic techniques with Eastern philosophy and practices, while also providing a comprehensive and pragmatic agenda for social work, and mental health professionals. This breakthrough text, written by a cast of highly regarded researchers from both Asia and America, presented a holistic, therapeutic approach that ties Eastern philosophy and practical techniques to Western forms of therapy in order to help bring about positive, transformative changes in individuals and families. This second features a major reorganization of Part III: Applications and Treatment Effectiveness, renamed to &quot;Evidence-informed Translational Practice and Evidence.&quot; Based on systematic reviews of Integrative body-mind-spirit practices, Part III provides a &quot;resource guide&quot; of different types of integrative practices used in diverse health and mental health conditions.  A new companion website includes streaming video clips showing demonstrations of the BMS techniques described in the book and worksheets and client resources/handouts.
Here, the authors provide a pragmatic, step-by-step description of assessment and treatment techniques that employ an integrative, holistic perspective. They begin by establishing the conceptual framework of integrative body-mind-spirit social work, then expertly describe, step-by-step, assessment and treatment techniques that utilize integrative and holistic perspectives. Numerous case studies demonstrate the approach in action, such as one with breast cancer patients who participated in body-mind-spirit and social support groups and another in which trauma survivors used meditation to get onto a path of healing. These examples provide solid empirical evidence that integrative body-mind-spirit social work is indeed a practical therapeutic approach in bringing about tangible changes in clients. The authors also discuss ethical issues and give tips for learning integrative body-mind-spirit social work. Professionals in social work, psychology, counseling, and nursing, as well as graduate students in courses on integral, alternative, or complementary clinical practice will find this a much-needed resource that complements the growing interest in alternatives to traditional Western psychotherapy." />
