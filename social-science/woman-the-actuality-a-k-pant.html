  <title>Woman, the Actuality - A.K. Pant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marriage is not a moral sexual debauchment consented by the society instead it describes an ethical limit of morality in sexual relations beyond which the sexual relations are considered to be illicit or adultery. Marriage is a great attempt to keep the society free from
sexual debauchment by assigning one man for one lady and one lady for one man. Marriage is not a compulsion instead it is a confession done with mutual consent to live a peaceful life
devotedly with each other. From the point of view of sexual relations, marriage is a factor which distinguishes human from animals. It is sacred tribute to ancestors. It is an indication of
family succession or genealogy. Marriage is a ritual to provide social as well as legal acceptance to the child in the womb. Marriage is an indication of the death of the parents in the form of coming generations as it assures the eternal truth that older one has to end to provide the life and opportunities to the incoming generations. For men, marriage is in fact performing the moral, ritualistic and materialistic duties while for women this is mere the accomplishing of sanctifying rites and following the codes of conduct. Marriage is not an agreement done on behalf of a legal contract instead it is a complete dedication
free from compulsions. Wherever forementioned feelings do not exist in the background of the objectives of marriage, there marriage means mere accomplishment of sexual satisfaction and false ego and in this situation, marriage is just like a contract which if done by a man with one lady or four ladies, is mere sexual debauchment in the point of view of the morals and ethics." />
