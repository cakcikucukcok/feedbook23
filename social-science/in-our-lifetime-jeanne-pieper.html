  <title>In Our Lifetime… - Jeanne Pieper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Nun 
The Bishop
The Suburban Housewife and Mother.. 
What do they have in common?
Sister Maureen Connally has little sympathy for the agenda of the radical feminist nuns until the U.S. Bishops edit her sensitive report on &quot;Women in the Catholic Church&quot; into superficial nothingness and publish it under the name of a well known male cleric.
John O&#39;Malley, Bishop of San Francisco, has never been a risk taker until his innocent attendance at a feminist Mass for a dying nun brings angry Vatican accusations that he is sanctioning priesthood for women. 
Linda Bonn, the loving mother of three teenagers, is a dutiful wife and the pillar of her local parish church until her husband, jealous of her sudden success as a suburban Real Estate Agent, tricks her into an unwanted pregnancy. 
Equally oppressed by inflexible &quot;superiors&quot; and forced to confront personal fears and inadequacies they have never before acknowledged, these three devote Catholics discover both problem and solution in their religion. Upset by the out of touch official pronouncements of the Vatican, as well as the dishonest machinations for the hierarchy, yet unable and unwilling to break the spiritual ties of their childhood, they come to believe that THEY are the Catholic Church. At last, with their help, the time bomb that is within the Catholic Church in American today explodes IN THEIR LIFETIME." />
