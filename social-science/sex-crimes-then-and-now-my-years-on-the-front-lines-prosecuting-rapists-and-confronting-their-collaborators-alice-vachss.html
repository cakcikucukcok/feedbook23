  <title>Sex Crimes: Then and Now: My Years on the Front Lines Prosecuting Rapists and Confronting Their Collaborators - Alice Vachss</title>

Included are close-ups of her most harrowing cases, among them the predatory pedophile who headed a boy&amp;#39;s club to get closer to victims; the serial rapist who terrorized the city as &amp;quot;The Stalker&amp;quot;: and the violent incest offender who tortured his &amp;quot;property&amp;quot; (his own daughter.)&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;My first lesson about sex crimes prosecution,&amp;quot; Vachss writes, &amp;quot;was that perpetrators were not the only enemy.&amp;quot; She shows how the system is heavily weighted against victims.

Would she return to the front line? &amp;lsquo;Am I willing to put up with the politics of running for office, or the backstabbing and infighting of being an employee of an elected official? That&amp;#39;s a much tougher question.&amp;rsquo;&amp;quot; [Julie Bindel, &amp;quot;The rapists&amp;#39; enemy&amp;quot;]&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Sex Crimes Now&lt;/em&gt; finds Alice Vachss, still the same, back in the trenches insisting to a jury: &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have to prove motive. The motive for rape&lt;em&gt; is&lt;/em&gt; rape,&amp;quot; and battling a system hell-bent on freeing a monster. Inevitably, Vachss reached a point of no return, &amp;ldquo;Years before, Richard A.

Ever-aware of the politics of prosecution, Brown had waited until he was elected, not simply appointed, before taking it upon himself to decide how much weight &amp;lsquo;doing an excellent job&amp;rsquo; would or would not carry in his office.
