  <title>Studies in Contemporary Jewry: Volume XV: People of the City: Jews and the Urban Challenge - Ezra Mendelsohn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Jews have been an urban people par excellence, and their influence on the urban landscape is unmistakable. Who can imagine modern Vienna, Berlin, Warsaw, or New York, to name just a few examples, without their large, vibrant, and creative Jewish populations? Conversely, the urban experience has been a decisive factor in modern Jewish history.     This new volume in the acclaimed Studies in Contemporary Jewry series is devoted to the theme of Jews and the modern city. It features essays on Orthodox Jewry in the city, Jewish-Christian relations, klezmer music, the impact of urbanization on German Jewry, the Jewish communities in New York and St. Petersburg, and the emergence of the first Hebrew City (Tel-Aviv). It also includes a discussion of the new prayer book of the Conservative movement in Israel.     Like others in the series, this book presents current scholarship in the form of a symposium, essays, and book reviews by distinguished experts in Jewish studies from around the world. Published annually by the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Studies in Contemporary Jewry continues to be an invaluable resource for scholars of modern history and culture." />
