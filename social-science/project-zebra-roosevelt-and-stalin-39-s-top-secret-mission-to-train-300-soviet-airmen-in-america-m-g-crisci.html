  <title>Project Zebra: Roosevelt and Stalin&#39;s Top-Secret Mission to Train 300 Soviet Airmen in America - M.G. Crisci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Top-Secret Project Zebra was/is the only time in history that Soviet airmen were trained in America by Americans. Their mission: to fly a state-of-the-art amphibious warplane produced in Philadelphia. Incredibly, 185 of these huge, heavily-armed PBN-Nomad, painted with bright Red Army stars, were then ferried to the sleepy, patriotic town of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, without a single media leak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There, 11 hand-picked Naval officers befriended and trained 300+ Soviet airmen over a period of 18 months before the planes were dispatched to the Atlantic and Pacific theaters where they destroyed numerous Nazi U-Boats and Japanese submarines without losing a single plane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Project Zebra was more than a military mission. It became a historic human event.  The Soviet and American teams shared experiences that created bonds of trust and mutual respect, despite their language barriers and cultural differences &amp;ndash; something that might serve us well to model during these uncertain Russian-American moments. Project Zebra was declassified on December 31, 2012, and remains one of WWII&amp;#39;s last never-been-told stories. Until now!&lt;br&gt;" />
