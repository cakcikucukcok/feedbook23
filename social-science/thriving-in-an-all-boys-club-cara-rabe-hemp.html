  <title>Thriving in an All-Boys Club - Cara Rabe-Hemp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In 1845 women entered the career of policing, and ever since it&amp;rsquo;s been an evolving history for them. There are countless stories of women shaping this career, adding particular gifts and abilities to the profession. There are, also, countless stories of their struggles to fit in and survive in this &amp;ldquo;all-boys club.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Thriving in an All Boys Club: Female Police and Their Fight for Equality&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; examines one of the most debated issues surrounding female police officers &amp;ndash; their ability to find acceptance in the male subculture. Through the stories of women who joined policing in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s, readers learn that women&amp;rsquo;s acceptance in policing is complex and officer&amp;rsquo;s experiences are wide-ranging. Stories of resistance and harassment by colleagues, the glass ceiling in promotion, and gender specific obstacles related to pregnancy and childcare are common. Their stories show a strong sense of determination and perseverance to perform the duties of police officer. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;The potential for enduring change in the field of policing is growing as women continue to make strides in achieving high ranks, breaking down assignments barriers, and ensuring just opportunities for future generations of female police officers. Despite the struggles that women face to survive in the &amp;ldquo;all-boys club&amp;rdquo; of policing, women not only survive, most thrive in this almost exclusively male occupation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
