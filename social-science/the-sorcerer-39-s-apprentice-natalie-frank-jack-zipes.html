  <title>The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice - Natalie Frank, Jack Zipes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice&quot; might conjure up images of Mickey Mouse from the Disney film &lt;i&gt;Fantasia&lt;/i&gt;, or of Harry Potter. As this anthology reveals, however, &quot;sorcerer&#39;s apprentice&quot; tales&amp;#8212;in which a young person rebels against, or complies with, an authority who holds the keys to magical powers&amp;#8212;have been told through the centuries, in many languages and cultures, from classical times to today. This unique and beautifully illustrated book brings together more than fifty sorcerer&#39;s apprentice stories by a plethora of writers, including Ovid, Sir Walter Scott, and the Brothers Grimm. From Goethe&#39;s &quot;The Pupil in Magic&quot; to A. K. Ramanujan&#39;s &quot;The Guru and His Disciple,&quot; this expansive collection presents variations of a classic passed down through countries and eras.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers enter worlds where household objects are brought to life and shape-shifting occurs from human to animal and back again. We meet two types of apprentice: &quot;The Humiliated Apprentice,&quot; a foolish bumbler who wields magic ineffectively and promotes obedience to authority; and &quot;The Rebellious Apprentice&quot; who, through ambition and transformative skills, promotes empowerment and self-awareness. In an extensive introduction, esteemed fairy-tale scholar Jack Zipes discusses the significance and meaning of the apprentice stories, the contradictions in popular retellings, and the importance of magic as a tool of resistance against figures who abuse their authority. Twenty specially commissioned black-and-white illustrations by noted artist Natalie Frank bring the stories to visual life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice&lt;/i&gt; enlightens and entertains readers with enduring, spellbinding tales of sorcery that have been with us through the ages.&lt;/p&gt;" />
