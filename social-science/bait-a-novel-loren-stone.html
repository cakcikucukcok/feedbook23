  <title>Bait - A Novel - Loren Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s been years, since radical lesbian Jax Madigan had much contact with her conservative family. Her independence long ago ruled out peaceful co-existence with her relatives. Her only steady contact with her past is with her brother, Danny, who keeps in touch, despite his objection to her &quot;lifestyle choices.&quot;  But when Danny meets and brings home the woman of his dreams, Jax finds herself once more drawn into a family dynamic that is both rewarding and punishing, and even after all these years, intimately familiar. Danny&#39;s girl, Jenn, is beautiful, poised, articulate, and eager to spend time with the black sheep of the family. And it only takes a few visits to reveal she&#39;s as attracted to both Jax and Danny, as they are to her.  Bait explores the limits of love and loyalty, sibling rivalry and tempting taboo. In a volatile mix of wit and wantonness, brother and sister, parents and children, in-laws and outlaws, must all decide how far they will go, to save someone&#39;s soul." />
