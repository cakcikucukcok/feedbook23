  <title>Appeals to Interest - Dean Mathiowetz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It has become a commonplace assumption in modern political debate that white and rural working- and middle-class citizens in the United States who have been rallied by Republicans in the &amp;ldquo;culture wars&amp;rdquo; to vote Republican have been voting &amp;ldquo;against their interests.&amp;rdquo; But what, exactly, are these &amp;ldquo;interests&amp;rdquo; that these voters are supposed to have been voting against? It reveals a lot about the role of the notion of interest in political debate today to realize that these &amp;ldquo;interests&amp;rdquo; are taken for granted to be the narrowly self-regarding, primarily economic &amp;ldquo;interests&amp;rdquo; of the individual. Exposing and contesting this view of interests, Dean Mathiowetz finds in the language of interest an already potent critique of neoliberal political, theoretical, and methodological imperatives&amp;mdash;and shows how such a critique has long been active in the term&amp;rsquo;s rich history. Through an innovative historical investigation of the language of interest, Mathiowetz shows that appeals to interest are always politically contestable claims about &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; somebody is&amp;mdash;and a provocation to action on behalf of that &amp;ldquo;who.&amp;rdquo; &lt;em&gt;Appeals to Interest&lt;/em&gt; exposes the theoretical and political costs of our widespread denial of this crucial role of interest-talk in the constitution of political identity, in political theory and social science alike.&lt;/p&gt;" />
