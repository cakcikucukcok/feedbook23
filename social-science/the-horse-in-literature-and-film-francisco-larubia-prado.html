  <title>The Horse in Literature and Film - Francisco LaRubia-Prado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Horses serve as central characters in great literary works that span ages and cultures. But why? In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Horse in Literature and Film: Uncovering a Transcultural Paradigm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Francisco LaRubia-Prado, Ph.D. explores the deep symbolic meaning, cultural significance, and projective power that these magnificent animals carry in literature, film, and the human psyche. Examining iconic texts and films from the Middle Ages to the present&amp;mdash;and from Western and Eastern cultural traditions&amp;mdash;this book reveals how horses, as timeless symbols of nature, bring harmony to unbalanced situations. Regardless of how disrupted human lives become, whether through the suffering caused by the atrocities of war, or the wrestling of individuals and society with issues of authenticity, horses offer an antidote firmly rooted in nature.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Horse in Literature and Film &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is a book for our time. After an introduction to the field of animal studies, it analyzes celebrated works by authors and film directors such as Leo Tolstoy, Heinrich von Kleist, D.H. Lawrence, Akira Kurosawa, John Huston, Girish Karnad, Michael Morpurgo, and Benedikt Erlingsson. Exploring issues such as power, the boundaries between justice and the law, the meaning of love and home, the significance of cultural belonging, and the consequences of misguided nationalism, this book demonstrates the far-reaching consequences of human disconnection from nature, and the role of the horse in individual and societal healing. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
