  <title>The Death of the Grown-Up - Diana West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Diana West sees a US filled with middle-age guys playing air guitar and thinks &quot;No wonder we can&#39;t stop Islamic terrorism.&quot;  She sees Moms Who Mosh and wonders &quot;Is there a single adult left anywhere?&quot;  But, the grown-ups are all gone.  The disease that killed them was incubated in the sixties to a rock-and-roll score, took hold in the seventies with the help of multiculturalism and left us with a nation of eternal adolescents who can&#39;t decide between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot;, a generation who can&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;.  From the inability to nix a sixteen year-old&#39;s request for Marilyn Manson concert tickets to offering adolescents parentally-funded motel rooms on prom night to rationalizing murderous acts of Islamic suicide bombers with platitudes of cultural equivalence, West sees us on a slippery slope that&#39;s lead to a time when America has forgotten its place in the world.  In &lt;i&gt;The Death of the Grown-Up&lt;/i&gt; Diana West serves up a provocative critique of our dangerously indecisive world leavened with humor and shot through with insight.&lt;/p&gt;" />
