  <title>Japan Restored: How Japan Can Reinvent Itself and Why This Is Important for America and the World - Clyde Prestowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;How Japan Can Reinvent Itself and Why This Is Important for America and the World.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In 1979, the book &lt;I&gt;Japan as Number One: Lessons for America&lt;/I&gt; by Harvard University professor Ezra Vogel caused a sensation in the United States by pointing out that Japan was surpassing America as world economic leader; the book remains to this day the all-time bestseller in Japan of non-fiction by a Western author. The book was timely: Japan&#39;s subsequent &quot;bubble era&quot; of the 1980s saw the country booming. But since the economic bubble burst at the start of the 1990s, Japan has been in decline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Japan Restored&lt;/I&gt; by Clyde Prestowitz, taking up Vogel&#39;s baton, is written as a vision of Japan in the year 2050, when the country&#39;s economic recovery has made it a world leader in every area of human endeavor. Prestowitz looks back to the year 2014 as such a low point for Japan that a special reform commission was set up that helped the country regain its former position as a leader in technology, in business, and geopolitically. Looking at education, innovation, the role of women, corporate organization, energy, infrastructure, domestic government, and international alliances Prestowitz draws up a fascinating and controversial blueprint for the future success of Japan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the eyes of the world turn towards Japan in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics, &lt;I&gt;Japan Restored&lt;/I&gt; is as timely as the 1979 Vogel book that inspired it.&lt;/div&gt;" />
