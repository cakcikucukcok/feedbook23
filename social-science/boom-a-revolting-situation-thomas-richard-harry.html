  <title>Boom! a Revolting Situation - Thomas Richard Harry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The idea of revolution is to take action. The goal of revolution is positive change.&lt;br&gt;
Thomas Richard Harry&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Boom! A Revolting Situation&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;BOOM!&lt;/i&gt; is a tough-minded eye-opening appraisal of American Democracy that highlights serious lack of choice in todays political arena. Party identification is unraveling; increasingly voters opt not to be identified with them. Nothing has yet developed to fill this void. The result: millions of political Independents with no place to turn come election time except to these two Parties they apparently reject. Today these non-aligned conservative and liberal Americans surpass either Democrats or Republicans. Contrary to some, Independents do represent a powerful political potentialthey just dont realize it yet. A plurality of our electorate, they have no option other than a least-worst political choice. That seems a democratic absurdity. Thats akin to political coercion, at best; political disenfranchisement, at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;BOOM!&lt;/i&gt; clarifies the primary historical (and on-going) antagonism in American politics and identifies what may well be the political objective of Independents. It then walks its readers through how this plurality of political orphans might achieve this goal. Its an option that doesnt rely on the failed ideological approach of todays duopoly. It could reinvigorate politics and change the direction of government towards achieving a more balanced outcomeall within our existing electoral system!&lt;/p&gt;" />
