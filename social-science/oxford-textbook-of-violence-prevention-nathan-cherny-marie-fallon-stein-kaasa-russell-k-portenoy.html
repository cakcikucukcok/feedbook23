  <title>Oxford Textbook of Violence Prevention - Nathan Cherny, Marie Fallon, Stein Kaasa, Russell K. Portenoy...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Violence has always been, and is to this day, a primary cause of tension and suffering the world over. More than half a million people are murdered each year around the world, making homicide the leading cause of death among people aged 15-44. The Oxford Textbook of Violence Prevention brings together an international team of experts to provide an extensive global account of the mortality and morbidity burden caused by violence. It does this by examining the
causes of violence, and what can be done to prevent and reduce violence.
Divided into six sections, the textbook analyses how a public health approach can help to prevent violence. This multidisciplinary book tackles interpersonal violence in all its forms. Early chapters describe epidemiology and consequences, followed by chapters that present the current state of the evidence in interventions. Policies for violence reduction are discussed, and finally recommendations are made for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers. The Oxford Textbook of Violence
Prevention is an essential resource for anyone involved in seeking to reduce the role of violence in modern society.
The print edition is complimented with 12 months free access to the online version. Featuring the full comprehensive and authoritative text of the book, the online edition has the added convenience and flexibility of an online resource and is available on oxfordmedicine.com." />
