  <title>Run in My Shoes (Second Edition) - Phillip Bell Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Run In MY Shoes is a chronological historical account regarding the political and social economic reasons
concerning the development of Racism in American History.  Written by an author who grew up during the turbulent
Sixties/Civil Rights Struggles regarding the Black/White divide.  Run In My Shoes highlights the American social
economical historical facts and periods that define the American Social adaptations.  The author personally
highlights his personal social experiment of being the third  African American to integrate St. Stephen&#39;s school, 
an elite all white male college preparatory school in the state of Virginia during the late 60&#39;s.  The author also
highlights other pioneers regarding the history of race relations in America in order to show the comparisons and contrasts
of the depths of social impacts affecting not only an individual , but America&#39;s racial problems, social issues, contributions and experiences of others
whom contributed to the legacy of race relations.  However, an important theme of the book is the author&#39;s reasons for writing
 this book.  He wanted to highlight his unique experiences, passions, education, and life long academic research towards uncovering of the 
truths and facts from historical racist myths in order to showcase important realities regarding racism for profit, as well as for permanent
control and dominance over African Americans people from slavery to the present.
     Run In My Shoes defines the pace and passion that the author wanted to highlight in order to help sensitize the reader&#39;s consciousness
 concerning the discriminating racially violent sociological world of America&#39;s black and white realities no matter whatever one&#39;s hue,
, black, white, brown, yellow, or red.  It brings to light the pain and suffering regarding  what did stem from the American Peculiar Institution past and present.
  The author makes an attempt to show how much effort we still need for all Americans to work towards a change in our system.  Racism has and to this day
 continues to effect the social, economic, cultural,educational, and spiritual relations in this country since the arrival of the Europeans to America.
  Racism is designed to establish one group of humans over the other races as the owners of resources and greater privileges while maintaining
 a master/servant hierarchy that allows for the institution to exist. 
     Lastly, Run In My Shoes was intended to be a therapeutic study regarding the true historical facts concerning Racism, and a re-education plan towards helping
to improve the self esteem of African Americans and to improve the factual knowledge levels of all it&#39;s citizens in order to enhance a non violence approach to the
 present and future generations in order to create a more perfect American Union.  Also to truly showcase America&#39;s resolve to make the improvements in human
 relations in our country so that abroad we do not appear so totally hypocritical regarding our spreading our way of life to other countries." />
