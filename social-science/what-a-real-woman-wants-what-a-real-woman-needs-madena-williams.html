  <title>What a Real Woman Wants, What a Real Woman Needs - Madena Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THIS IS HOW YOU SEARCH FOR A MATE. IT ONLY WORKS IF YOU ACTUALLY USE IT.
Having a True Friend 
A lot of people use the word too loosely. I believe that most people dont know what a real friend is, but I do and I will share my thoughts. You see, a true friend is someone who doesnt play games with your feelings, and doesnt give false hope to you. A true friend is a person who guides you in a positive way, who takes it upon themselves to be true confidant to you, and doesnt reveal any personal secrets. A true friend is someone who doesnt put you in danger or dangerous situations. A true friend is understanding, loving, and a positive influence on your character. A friend like this can turn into the true mate that you may be in search for. 
If this is the type of mate you want, then you must seek this type of friend, give the friendship 6 mos. to a year, then ( If permitted) turn it into a relationship. (Something to think about)
