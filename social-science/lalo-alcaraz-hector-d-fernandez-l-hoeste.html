  <title>Lalo Alcaraz - Hector D. Fernandez L’Hoeste</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amid the controversy surrounding immigration and border control, the work of California cartoonist Lalo Alcaraz (b. 1964) has delivered a resolute Latino viewpoint. Of Mexican descent, Alcaraz fights for Latino rights through his creativity, drawing political commentary as well as underlining how Latinos confront discrimination on a daily basis. Through an analysis of Alcaraz&amp;#8217;s early editorial cartooning and his strips for &lt;i&gt;La Cucaracha&lt;/i&gt;, the first nationally syndicated, political Latino daily comic strip, author H&amp;#233;ctor D. Fern&amp;#225;ndez L&amp;#8217;Hoeste shows the many ways Alcaraz&amp;#8217;s art attests to the community&amp;#8217;s struggles.&lt;p&gt;Alcaraz has proven controversial with his satirical, sharp commentary on immigration and other Latino issues. What makes Alcaraz&amp;#8217;s work so potent? Fern&amp;#225;ndez L&amp;#8217;Hoeste marks the artist&amp;#8217;s insistence on never letting go of what he views as injustice against Latinos, the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States. Indeed, his comics predict a key moment in the future of the United States&amp;#8212;that time when a racial plurality will steer the country, rather than a white majority and its monocultural norms.&lt;p&gt;Fern&amp;#225;ndez L&amp;#8217;Hoeste&amp;#8217;s study provides an accessible, comprehensive view into the work of a cartoonist who deserves greater recognition, not just because Alcaraz represents the injustice and inequity prevalent in our society, but because as both a US citizen and a member of the Latino community, his ability to stand in, between, and outside two cultures affords him the clarity and experience necessary to be a powerful voice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
