  <title>Culture of Opportunity: Obama&#39;s Chicago - Rebecca Janowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rebecca Janowitz&#39;s portrait of Hyde Park-the Chicago South Side neighborhood long noted for its progressive politics-offers an expert, insider&#39;s social and political perspective on this intriguing community that in many ways nurtured Barack Obama&#39;s political career and made possible his run for the presidency. Sixty years ago-due to a major community grassroots organizing effort, followed by a publicly funded urban renewal program-the Hyde Park-Kenwood area of Chicago emerged as a diverse, politically confident community in a key lakefront location within a city noted for its segregated neighborhoods, cultivating a rich and congenial cultural tradition. Before achieving racial balance, Hyde Park had become a center of progressive politics dating from the late nineteenth century. Scholarly reformers-many from the University of Chicago, by then a part of the community-as well as clergy, women, and blacks had sought more influence in the city from a base in Hyde Park. The neighborhood offered a political alternative for people throughout Chicago who were dissatisfied with the city&#39;s corrupt patronage politics. Hyde Park was ready for Barack Obama as a political contender before he was ready to assume that role. As early as the 1960s, Hyde Park reformers were looking for strong black leaders to serve a progressive white constituency as well as the black community. The willingness of Hyde Parkers, especially progressive Jews, to rally behind Harold Washington helped him become Chicago&#39;s first black mayor and a mayor committed to reform. In the course of Obama&#39;s rise to power, Hyde Park proved its usefulness again as a sounding board, support system, and launching pad for political change. Culture of Opportunity will introduce you to one of the most distinctive and unusual neighborhoods in the United States." />
