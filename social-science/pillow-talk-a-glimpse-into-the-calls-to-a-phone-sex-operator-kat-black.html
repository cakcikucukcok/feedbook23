  <title>Pillow Talk: A Glimpse Into the Calls to a Phone Sex Operator - Kat Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What makes a man, or for that matter, a woman as well, call a phone sex line? Phone Sex lines cater to all walks of life. Bankers, construction workers, lawyers, doctors, teachers, etc... you name it, I&#39;ve most likely talked to someone in any position. Even celebrities. Everyone has his or her needs.    Everyone has a fantasy, whether it&#39;s having sex in a public place, spanking or being spanked, having a chick with a dick, a male being f****d anally with a strap-on by a woman, a woman who is bi-curious, or even a grown man dressing up as a baby and being cared for by an older woman. Yep, I&#39;ve acted out all those fantasies... well on the phone.  I must say though, my sex life certainly has become interesting, to say the least. One thing I have learned while being Phone Sex Operator is what men and women want.     In this book, I will not only explain some of the terminology that a Phone Sex Operator (from now on I will call her/him a PSO) needs to know and my experiences over the years as one." />
