  <title>Rights Gone Wrong - Richard Thompson Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Notable Book for 2011 &lt;br&gt;Since the 1960s, ideas  developed during the civil rights movement have been astonishingly  successful in fighting overt discrimina­tion and prejudice. But how  successful are they at combating the &lt;i&gt;whole &lt;/i&gt;spectrum of social  injustice-including conditions that aren&#39;t directly caused by bigotry?  How do they stand up to segregation, for instance-a legacy of racism,  but not the direct result of ongoing discrimina­tion? It&#39;s tempting to  believe that civil rights litigation can combat these social ills as  efficiently as it has fought blatant discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Rights Gone Wrong&lt;/i&gt;, Richard Thompson Ford, author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Notable Book &lt;i&gt;The Race Card&lt;/i&gt;,  argues that this is seldom the case. Civil rights do too much and not  enough: opportunists use them to get a competitive edge in schools and  job markets, while special-interest groups use them to demand special  privileges. Extremists on both the left and the right have hijacked  civil rights for personal advantage. Worst of all, their theatrics have  drawn attention away from more seri­ous social injustices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ford,  a professor of law at Stanford University, shows us the many ways in  which civil rights can go terribly wrong. He examines newsworthy  lawsuits with shrewdness and humor, proving that the distinction between  civil rights and personal entitlements is often anything but clear.  Finally, he reveals how many of today&#39;s social injustices actually &lt;i&gt;can&#39;t &lt;/i&gt;be  remedied by civil rights law, and demands more creative and nuanced  solutions. In order to live up to the legacy of the civil rights  movement, we must renew our commitment to civil rights, and move beyond  them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
