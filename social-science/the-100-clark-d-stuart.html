  <title>The 100 - Clark D Stuart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An absolute truth, sometimes called a universal truth, is an unalterable and permanent fact.  It means that something is true no matter where you are and who says it, i.e., 2 +2 = 4, no matter where you go you get the same answer.  A universal truth is something anyone can benefit from.  They are simple lessons containing wisdom that often goes unnoticed or gets lost in the daily hustle and bustle of our over-stimulated lives.  This book is a testament to the struggles that we all face every day in our lives that we must rise up to and overcome in order to be our best and to achieve the miracle that we want to see. 
These principles are used as a part of Clarks Executive Presentations Skills Training Course.  Each has its own significance and each is able to stand alone.  Although numbered for reference purposes, they are not presented in any particular order of importance.  Clearly, there are far more than 100 principles of communications, but these are the ones most likely to resonate.  Like all great truths, they have a timeless quality making them just as meaningful today as they were in the beginning of time and ensuring that they will maintain their significance far into the future." />
