  <title>Earthmovers in Scotland: Mining, Quarries, Roads and Forestry - David Wylie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As Scottish Correspondent for Earthmovers Magazine, David Wylie has enjoyed privileged access to the mines, quarries, road projects and forestry sites across Scotland. On his visits he has seen some of the biggest and arguably the best, earthmoving machinery in the world, in action. Earthmovers in Scotland brings together 32 of David&#39;s reports from these visits to tell the story of the highly skilled, experienced owners, drivers and managers that work with earthmoving equipment and explains why they select, maintain and operate these machines. The book features some of the largest earthmovers in the UK, such as Caterpillar&#39;s D11R bulldozer, Liebherr&#39;s massive 320 tonne R9350s and the mighty 520 tonne Q&amp;K RH200 at Banks Mining Shotton surface mine in Northumberland, a short hop over the Scottish border. It also takes a look at a 1.5 tonne mini digger, special trailers that can lift and transport 1800 tonne bridges into position, and covers Demag&#39;s H485 record breaking mining shovel amongst others.Taking pride of place in the book are over 400 stunning photographs, many of which have not been seen before and many of which feature machines that were the first of their kind.Each high quality photo has been carefully composed to capture each machine in all its power and brilliance with the spectacular Scottish scenery as a backdrop and 80 of the most important and detailed images are presented as double pages to help you get close to the action. This beautiful book sets out to provide its owner with a comprehensive look at Scottish earthmovers scene, and will be of interest to enthusiasts, owners, drivers and site managers worldwide." />
