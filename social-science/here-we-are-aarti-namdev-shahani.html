  <title>Here We Are - Aarti Namdev Shahani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here We Are &lt;/i&gt;is a heart-wrenching memoir about an immigrant family&#39;s American Dream, the justice system that took it away, and the daughter who fought to get it back, from NPR correspondent Aarti Namdev Shahani.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Shahanis came to Queens--from India, by way of Casablanca--in the 1980s. They were undocumented for a few unsteady years and then, with the arrival of their green cards, they thought they&#39;d made it. This is the story of how they did, and didn&#39;t; the unforeseen obstacles that propelled them into years of disillusionment and heartbreak; and the strength of a family determined to stay together.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Here We Are: American Dreams, American Nightmares&lt;/i&gt; follows the lives of Aarti, the precocious scholarship kid at one of Manhattan&#39;s most elite prep schools, and her dad, the shopkeeper who mistakenly sells watches and calculators to the notorious Cali drug cartel. Together, the two represent the extremes that coexist in our country, even within a single family, and a truth about immigrants that gets lost in the headlines. It isn&#39;t a matter of good or evil; it&#39;s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;i&gt;Here We Are&lt;/i&gt; is a coming-of-age story, a love letter from an outspoken modern daughter to her soft-spoken Old World father. She never expected they&#39;d become best friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
