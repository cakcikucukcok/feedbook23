  <title>The Injustice of Justice - Donald Grady II</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Injustice of Justice is a purposeful book designed to introduce the public as well as the profession to an alternate method of policing with a whole-community and responsibility-based approach. Don has written the book from the perspective of a businessman whose interest and subsequent involvement stems first from his employee, then a compassionate and compelling group of individuals in law enforcement and our justice system.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Equal protection under the law is one of the basic premises of the American justice system. Yet many Americans feel this concept is not only elusive, but virtually impossible to attain. It&amp;#39;s something we hope for and work to make real. Chief Grady has given us a practical approach to seeking justice while at the same time practicing reality. His book should be a must read for courses in community-police relations and for individuals and groups who want to better understand how our criminal justice system works, what good policing is, what changes are needed, and how we can all engage in making it happen. One of the great divides in our country is how different racial, ethnic, gender and age groups view law enforcement and the criminal justice system. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Donald Grady, Ph.D. has written an easy-to-read, easy-to-understand and easy-to-decipher book that becomes more intriguing with each page. I love it!&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&amp;mdash;Danny K. Davis, Ph.D.; U.S. Representative; 7th Congressional District, Illinois" />
