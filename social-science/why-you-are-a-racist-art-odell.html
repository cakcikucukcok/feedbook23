  <title>Why You Are a Racist - Art Odell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;CENTER&gt;TEAR DOWN THAT WALL OF GUILT!&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are trying to raise a respectful and respectable American family and are embarrassed by the liberal medias filth and perversion you and your children are subjected to on a daily basis, remember one thing: Liberalism is at its core, licentious, morally degrading and abusive to family life. To stop the abuse you must embrace the truth: Conservatism conserves and protects family values that have made America the shining beacon of Christian family life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To preserve the American family you must make a decision not merely to eschew liberalism and degradation but to champion conservatism and our traditional American values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do so you must first TEAR DOWN THAT WALL OF GUILT! You must know you are guilty of nothing that may have happened to a Negro, Indian, Asian or Jew at any time in our recent or ancient past, and you must stop bowing at the silly altar of political correctness. You must regain your dignity, your individuality and your moral certitude. You must rise up and be counted as an American heart and soul, in spirit and purpose; willing to sacrifice whatever it takes to preserve America as it was founded to be and for which so many fought and died for it to be. Your children are counting on you. They will not survive as free Americans without your courage and your resolve. TEAR DOWN THAT WALL OF GUILT! LET THE RECLAMATION OF AMERICA BEGIN! &lt;/p&gt;" />
