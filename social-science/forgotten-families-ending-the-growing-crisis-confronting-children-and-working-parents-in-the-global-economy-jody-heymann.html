  <title>Forgotten Families: Ending the Growing Crisis Confronting Children and Working Parents in the Global Economy - Jody Heymann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the last half-century, radical changes have rippled through the workplace and the home from Boston to Bombay. In the face of rapid globalization, these changes affect us all, and we can no longer confine ourselves to addressing working and social conditions within our own borders without simultaneously addressing them on a global scale. Based on over a thousand in-depth interviews and survey data from more than 55,000 families spanning five continents, Forgotten Families is the first truly global account of how the changing conditions of work threaten children, women and men, and the infirm.  It addresses problems faced by working families in industrialized and developing countries alike, touching on issues of child health and development, barriers to parents getting and keeping jobs, problems families confront daily and in times of crisis, and the roles of growing inequalities.  Rich in individual stories and deeply human, Heymanns book proposes innovative and imaginative ideas for solving the problems of the truly belabored together as a global community. " />
