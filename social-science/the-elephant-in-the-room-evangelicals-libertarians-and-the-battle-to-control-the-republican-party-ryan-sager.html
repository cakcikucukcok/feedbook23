  <title>The Elephant in the Room: Evangelicals, Libertarians, and the Battle to Control the Republican Party - Ryan Sager</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praise for The Elephant in the Room&lt;P&gt;&quot;This funny, sobering, smart book reminds Republicans that having beliefs isn&#39;t good enough. You have to act on them. Winning isn&#39;t enough; you have to win with a purpose in mind. Ryan Sager sounds a real call to arms. The party would be wise to hear it.&quot;--Peggy Noonan, columnist, The Wall Street Journal&lt;BR&gt;&quot;An insightful and eminently readable account of the current conservative crackup. Anyone who wants to understand American politics today needs to read Sager&#39;s chronicle of the ongoing civil war in the conservative ranks.&quot;--Paul Begala, coauthor of Take It Back&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Two feisty American factions are at daggers drawn. No, the fight is not conservatives versus liberals. Rather, it is libertarian conservatives versus &#39;social issues&#39; conservatives. In this illuminating examination of the changing ideological geography of American politics, Ryan Sager suggests that the conservatives must choose between Southern and Western flavors of conservatism. He prefers the latter.&quot;--George F. Will, syndicated columnist&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Sager picks up where Bruce Bartlett left off with Impostor. The Elephant in the Room tells us how libertarians and the Christian conservatives are at swords&#39; point over Bush&#39;s &#39;big government conservatism.&#39; Anyone who wants to understand this important debate should get a copy of Sager&#39;s book.&quot;--John B. Judis, coauthor of The Emerging Democratic Majority&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Ryan Sager offers an eloquent, elegant argument that the GOP has lost its way--an argument that even those of us who disagree with many of his criticisms and object passionately to many of his characterizations must take with the utmost seriousness.&quot;--John Podhoretz, author of Can She Be Stopped?" />
