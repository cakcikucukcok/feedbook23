  <title>Enda the Road - Gavan Reilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;By many measures Enda Kenny was Fine Gael’s most successful leader of all time, but his position as Taoiseach was thrown into turmoil in February 2017 by an explosive political scandal – one which threatened to collapse his government, and ultimately cost Kenny his job. In &lt;i &gt;Enda the Road: Nine Days That Toppled a Taoiseach&lt;/i&gt;, Gavan Reilly offers an enthralling blow-by-blow account of the Maurice McCabe scandal: how a Garda whistleblower was targeted by a national smear campaign, and how the government’s botched response led to a fatal loss of trust in its leader.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;p &gt;Compiled through exhaustive research and interviews with dozens of key figures and witnesses, &lt;i&gt;Enda the Road&lt;/i&gt; is the ultimate account of a nine-day political hurricane whirlwind that brought down a Taoiseach.&lt;/p&gt;
