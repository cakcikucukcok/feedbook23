  <title>The Indians’ New World - James H. Merrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This eloquent, pathbreaking account follows the Catawbas from their first contact with Europeans in the sixteenth century until they carved out a place in the American republic three centuries later. It is a story of Native agency, creativity, resilience, and endurance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Upon its original publication in 1989, James Merrell&#39;s definitive history of Catawbas and their neighbors in the southern piedmont helped signal a new direction in the study of Native Americans, serving as a model for their reintegration into American history. In an introduction written for this twentieth anniversary edition, Merrell recalls the book&#39;s origins and considers its place in the field of early American history in general and Native American history in particular, both at the time it was first published and two decades later.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
