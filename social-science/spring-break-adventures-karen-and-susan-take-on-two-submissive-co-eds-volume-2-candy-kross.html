  <title>Spring Break Adventures: Karen and Susan Take On Two Submissive Co-eds Volume 2 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;There are always college girls who want to stay here for Spring Break, you remember how it was when we were their age? Party, party, party.&quot; Karen laughed.    &quot;They do look like they know how to party too! Their outfits are to die for, darling!&quot; Lucy said.  Karen&#39;s friends were older sexy mature lesbians, who loved young girls, but Brenda and Kelly didn&#39;t know that yet. As the mature women looked up and down the young girls bodies in approval. The night had just begun and already they were feeling horny.    They are now playing spin the bottle:     Lucy slid her panties back on and went to spin the bottle. It landed on Donna. Donna drew a slip of paper. &quot;Make Brenda and Kelly strip naked by having them do a strip tease for you and then have them give you a lap dance.&quot; Donna untied Brenda&#39;s silk bonds around her wrists.     Brenda and Kelly stood up and Donna sat in Kelly&#39;s chair. They had never done a strip tease before and began to dance slowly and grind up against each other." />
