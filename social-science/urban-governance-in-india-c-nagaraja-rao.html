  <title>Urban Governance in India - C. Nagaraja Rao</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The importance of efficient urban governance needs no elaboration in an increasingly urbanising world. Cities with high population densities throw significant challenges of transportation, safety, urban revitalisation, social inclusion and cohesion, environmental protection, water, air, energy, sanitation and climate changes which will magnify in the near future if not properly addressed now. These socio-economic changes necessitate augmentation of urban finances for investment in well-planned urban development and to bring about reforms in governance to enforce efficient urban governance at all levels to cater to the needs of urbanites and to make cities inclusive, congestion-free, safe, resilient and sustainable in which all people have access to basic services, housing and mobility. The urban local governance structures, mechanism and arrangements should aim at facilitating the adoption and implementation of successful policies to meet the challenges of sustainable, safe and equitable urbanisation. This book discusses measures to stimulate revitalisation and foster better economic and social development through developing cooperation mechanism between local and national governments so that the challenges of urbanisation can be best utilised as opportunities of innovation, economic growth and employment." />
