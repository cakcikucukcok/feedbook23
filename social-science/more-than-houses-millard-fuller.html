  <title>More Than Houses - Millard Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In these pages you will find inspiring, true stories of people who didn&#39;t have hope?until they had a home. Stories of children who gained identity and confidence for their future. Of families made stronger and healthier and prison inmates who are now giving back to their communities. Of entire communities bonding together around an ethic of hard work and mutual respect. Of denominational, political, and racial barriers falling with every swing of the hammer. Of a growing host of young people engaged in the quest to end poverty housing. And even some wonderful love stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result is nothing less than the transformation of lives, communities, and families?one person, one home at a time. Which, of course, has always been the dream?to build more than houses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Habitat for Humanity is building much more than houses. By building hope it is building relationships, strengthening communities, and nurturing families.&quot; ?Actor Paul Newman, Habitat supporter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rosalynn and I believe in Habitat&#39;s integrity, effectiveness, and tremendous vision. With Habitat, we build more than houses. We build families, communities, and hope.&quot; ?Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I could have gone through my whole life bouncing back and forth on welfare. Habitat makes a difference, and allows people to be what God intended them to be instead of what their circumstances dictate.&quot; ?Missouri homeowner Terrie Robinson&lt;/p&gt;
