  <title>The Mexican Heartland - John Tutino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A major new history of capitalism from the perspective of the indigenous peoples of Mexico, who sustained and resisted it for centuries&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Mexican Heartland&lt;/i&gt; provides a new history of capitalism from the perspective of the landed communities surrounding Mexico City. In a sweeping analytical narrative spanning the sixteenth century to today, John Tutino challenges our basic assumptions about the forces that shaped global capitalism&amp;#8212;setting families and communities at the center of histories that transformed the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite invasion, disease, and depopulation, Mexico&amp;#8217;s heartland communities held strong on the land, adapting to sustain and shape the dynamic silver capitalism so pivotal to Spain&amp;#8217;s empire and world trade for centuries after 1550. They joined in insurgencies that brought the collapse of silver and other key global trades after 1810 as Mexico became a nation, then struggled to keep land and self-rule in the face of liberal national projects. They drove Zapata&amp;#8217;s 1910 revolution&amp;#8212;a rising that rattled Mexico and the world of industrial capitalism. Although the revolt faced defeat, adamant communities forced a land reform that put them at the center of Mexico&amp;#8217;s experiment in national capitalism after 1920. Then, from the 1950s, population growth and technical innovations drove people from rural communities to a metropolis spreading across the land. The heartland urbanized, leaving people searching for new lives&amp;#8212;dependent, often desperate, yet still pressing their needs in a globalizing world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A masterful work of scholarship, &lt;i&gt;The Mexican Heartland&lt;/i&gt; is the story of how landed communities and families around Mexico City sustained silver capitalism, challenged industrial capitalism&amp;#8212;and now struggle under globalizing urban capitalism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
