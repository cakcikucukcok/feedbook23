  <title>Radio Fields - Lucas Bessire, Daniel Fisher, Faye Ginsburg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Radio is the most widespread electronic medium in the world today.  As a form of technology that is both durable and relatively cheap, radio  remains central to the everyday lives of billions of people around the  globe. It is used as a call for prayer in Argentina and Appalachia, to  organize political protest in Mexico and Libya, and for wartime  communication in Iraq and Afghanistan. In urban centers it is played  constantly in shopping malls, waiting rooms, and classrooms. Yet despite  its omnipresence, it remains the media form least studied by  anthropologists.&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radio Fields&lt;/em&gt; employs ethnographic methods to reveal the  diverse domains in which radio is imagined, deployed, and understood.  Drawing on research from six continents, the volume demonstrates how the  particular capacities and practices of radio provide singular insight  into diverse social worlds, ranging from aboriginal Australia to urban  Zambia. Together, the contributors address how radio creates distinct  possibilities for rethinking such fundamental concepts as culture,  communication, community, and collective agency. &lt;/div&gt;" />
