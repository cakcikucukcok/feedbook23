  <title>Immigration, Integration and Mobility: New Agendas in Migration Studies - Adrian Favell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A compilation of Adrian Favell&#39;s innovative and agenda-setting essays which, since the late 1990s, have charted the emergence of new migration patterns and politics in Europe. Tackling in turn issues of multiculturalism, immigrant integration, free movement, high skilled mobilities, new East-West migrations and regional integration, the collection offers a comprehensive introduction to the dynamic field of international migration studies. At the same time, it poses a sharp challenge to current complacencies, challenging researchers to escape methodological nationalism and the unreflective reproduction of concepts and assumptions in the field, as well as embracing new methodologies and theoretical resources. Moving fluidly across intellectual boundaries as much as national borders, Favell points the way forward to new thinking in this burgeoning and rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field. &#39;Migration studies is an increasingly vital, but also increasingly crowded field, where the cacophony of voices threatens to drown out any clear message. The exception is found in this volume of beautifully written essays, which puts Adrian Favell&#39;s trademark iconoclasm, crackling wit, and deep learning on clear display. Spanning the field and engaging with the controversies stirring scholarly waters on both sides of the Atlantic, Immigration, Integration and Mobility both reviews and sets the agendas for migration researchers. A volume that students and scholars will ponder and savour.&#39; Roger Waldinger, Distinguished Professor, Sociology Department, University of California, Los Angeles &#39;Adrian Favell is not only the sharpest critic of European migration studies but also a pioneer who takes transnationalism and transdisciplinarity seriously in his own work. The ten essays in this book are a &#39;best of&#39; selection representative of Favell&#39;s interventions... A critical mirror for a booming research field still struggling to understand its topic... Indispensable reading.&#39; Rainer Bauböck, Professor of Social and Political Theory, European University Institute, Florence &#39;This book takes us through several decades of migration debates, while remembering that at the heart of questions of migration are issues of differences in wealth, power, opportunity and futures... Provides much-needed critical perspectives on mainstream migration scholarship that has consistently failed to shed the blinkers of methodological nationalism.&#39; Nina Glick Schiller, Professor Emeritus of Anthropology, University of Manchester &#39;Adrian Favell is a maverick. His work is always interesting, pushing the boundaries of &#39;normal&#39; social science and expanding our knowledge of human mobility in all its dimensions... A collection of his most provocative essays, sure to top the reading list of every serious scholar of migration.&#39; James F Hollifield,Professor of Political Science, Southern Methodist University, Dallas" />
