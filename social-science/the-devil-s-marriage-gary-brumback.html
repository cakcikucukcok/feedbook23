  <title>The Devil’S Marriage - Gary Brumback</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;THE DEVILS MARRIAGE&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;BREAK UP THE CORPOCRACY OR LEAVE DEMOCRACY IN THE LURCH&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;America is becoming a ruiNation. The reason, well-known psychologist Dr. Gary Brumback, tells us is the corpocracy, the Devils Marriage between powerful corporations and patronizing politicians. He proposes Democracy Power, a revolutionary but civil, peaceful force to break up the corpocracy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Gary Brumback&#39;s passion for social and economic justice shines through every page of his new book. He tells it as he sees it, mincing no words. He shows how essential it is for us to change the rules of the game so that we may break the ties that bind corporations and government -- and move to a more equitable and sustainable future.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;---Riane Eisler, author of The Chalice and The Blade and The Real Wealth of Nations.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;A refreshing, exuberant read, full of sock-it-to-them creative insights about how corpocracy in the US has subverted democracy and what to do about it. This book is a political version of On the Road&quot;-- a passionate out flowing of analysis, critique and transformative strategies, including a vision of a national coalition of NGOs and movements uniting to challenge the corpocracy, spearheaded by a US Chamber of Democracy. Not for the faint of heart but red meat for progressives and activists everywhere.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;---Charles Derber, author of Corporation Nation, Regime Change Begins at Home, and, most recently, Greed to Green.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is an extraordinary and timely book that deserves to be widely read. Gary Brumback tells it like it is: America is no longer a democracy, governed by and for the people; we are a corpocracy governed by and for large corporations with the massive help of an obliging government. Their grip on our nation is tight, but not unbreakable. Brumback shows how we can loosen it and reclaim our democratic heritage.&lt;/P&gt;
,P&gt;---Peter Barnes, author of Capitalism 3.0: A Guide to Reclaiming the Commons, and co-founder of Working Assets.&lt;/P&gt;" />
