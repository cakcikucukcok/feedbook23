  <title>The Creative Destruction of New York City - Alessandro Busà</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bill de Blasio&#39;s campaign rhetoric focused on a tale of two cities: rich and poor New York. He promised to value the needs of poor and working-class New Yorkers, making city government work better for everyone-not just those who thrived during Bloomberg&#39;s tenure as mayor. But well into de Blasio&#39;s administration, many critics think that little has changed in the lives of struggling New Yorkers, and that the gentrification of New York City is expanding at a record pace across the five boroughs. Despite the mayor&#39;s goal of creating more affordable housing, Brooklyn and Manhattan sit atop the list of the most unaffordable housing markets in the country. It seems that the old adage is becoming truer: New York is a place for only the very rich and the very poor.
In &lt;em&gt;The Creative Destruction of New York City&lt;/em&gt;, urban scholar Alessandro Bus&amp;#224; travels to neighborhoods across the city, from Harlem to Coney Island, from Hell&#39;s Kitchen to East New York, to tell the story of fifteen years of drastic rezoning and rebranding, updating the tale of two New Yorks. There is a gilded city of sky-high glass towers where Wall Street managers and foreign billionaires live-or merely store their cash. And there is another New York: a place where even the professional middle class is one rent hike away from displacement. Despite de Blasio&#39;s rhetoric, the trajectory since Bloomberg has been remarkably consistent. New York&#39;s urban development is changing to meet the consumption demands of the very rich, and real estate moguls&#39; power has never been greater.
Major players in real estate, banking, and finance have worked to ensure that, regardless of changes in leadership, their interests are safeguarded at City Hall. &lt;em&gt;The Creative Destruction of New York City &lt;/em&gt;is an important chronicle of both the success of the city&#39;s elite and of efforts to counter the city&#39;s march toward a glossy and exclusionary urban landscape. It is essential reading for everyone who cares about affordable housing access and, indeed, the soul of New York City." />
