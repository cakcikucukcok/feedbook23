  <title>Friends Near Home - Dr. Muhammad Anwar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pakistan has been subjected to numerous pulls an pressures since its independence. Despite being part of the US-led alliances, Pakistan was dismembered in 1971. With the end of the Cold War, the situation has gone from bad to worse and even after a long period of existence Pakistans security remains threatened by the adversary. Consequently Pakistan has to spend much more on defence than her resources permitting. The only plausible way out for Pakistan is to look for Friends near Home who could act as the relief zones to off-set the potential threat and provide all possible assistance to safeguard her strategic security interests.
Friends Near Home presents the realistic perspective, analysis and aspirations by someone from the soil which should interest the civilians as well as those in uniform. Focussing on Pakistans strategic security options, the thesis succinctly examines the politico-strategic and maritime environment of the region which includes South Asia, South-West Asia and Central Asia with special reference to the North-West Indian Ocean Region milieu. The author has made a positive effort to analyse the viability and efficacy of the regional states i.e. Friends near Home, with a view to enhance Pakistans security parameters. All this reflects authors vision of Pakistan into 21st Century and beyond.
This book also presents the guiding principles for the regional as well as extra regional countries. Some bold thoughts and recommendations suggested in this book could serve as the stabilizing factors for the region and ultimately contributing towards the world peace and stability. Expansion of the Gulf Cooperation Council leading to the establishment of the Enlarged Economic Cooperation Organisation is one such realistic but challenging proposition. Pakistans envisaged maritime orientation should conveniently help attainment of this difficult but achievable objective. Those in power should carry this vision to the testing grounds for the sake of a promising future ushering a new era of cooperation and development in this resource-rich region, and striving together for world peace and stability." />
