  <title>A Road Unforeseen - Meredith Tax</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;This is the book I&amp;#8217;ve been waiting for&amp;#151;only it&amp;#8217;s richer, deeper, and more intriguing than I could have imagined. &lt;I&gt;A Road Unforeseen&lt;/I&gt; is a major contribution to our understanding of feminism and Islam, of women and the world, and gives me fresh hope for change.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Barbara Ehrenreich&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;Nickel and Dimed&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Living With a Wild God&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In war-torn northern Syria, a democratic society&amp;#151;based on secularism, ethnic inclusiveness, and gender equality&amp;#151;has won significant victories against the Islamic State, or Daesh, with women on the front lines as fierce warriors and leaders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;A Road Unforeseen&lt;/I&gt; recounts the dramatic, underreported history of the Rojava Kurds, whose all-women militia was instrumental in the perilous mountaintop rescue of tens of thousands of civilians besieged in Iraq. Up to that point, the Islamic State had seemed invincible. Yet these women helped vanquish them, bringing the first half of the refugees to safety within twenty-four hours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Who are the revolutionary women of Rojava and what lessons can we learn from their heroic story? How does their political philosophy differ from that of Iraqi Kurdistan, the Islamic State, and Turkey? And will the politics of the twenty-first century be shaped by the opposition between these political models?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Meredith Tax&lt;/B&gt; is a writer and political activist. Author, most recently, of &lt;I&gt;Double Bind: The Muslim Right, the Anglo-American Left, and Universal Human Rights&lt;/I&gt;, she was founding president of Women&amp;#8217;s WORLD, a global free speech network of feminist writers, and cofounder of the PEN American Center&amp;#8217;s Women&amp;#8217;s Committee and the International PEN Women Writers&amp;#8217; Committee.
