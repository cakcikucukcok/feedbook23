  <title>Care Across Generations - Kristin E. Yarris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Global inequalities make it difficult for parents in developing nations to provide for their children. Some determine that migration in search of higher wages is their only hope. Many studies have looked at how migration transforms the child–parent relationship. But what happens to other generational relationships when mothers migrate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Care Across Generations&lt;/i&gt; takes a close look at grandmother care in Nicaraguan transnational families, examining both the structural and gendered inequalities that motivate migration and caregiving as well as the cultural values that sustain intergenerational care. Kristin E. Yarris broadens the transnational migrant story beyond the parent–child relationship, situating care across generations and embedded within the kin networks in sending countries. Rather than casting the consequences of women&#39;s migration in migrant sending countries solely in terms of a &quot;care deficit,&quot; Yarris shows how intergenerational reconfigurations of care serve as a resource for the wellbeing of children and other family members who stay behind after transnational migration. Moving our perspective across borders and over generations, &lt;i&gt;Care Across Generations&lt;/i&gt; shows the social and moral value of intergenerational care for contemporary transnational families.&lt;/p&gt;" />
