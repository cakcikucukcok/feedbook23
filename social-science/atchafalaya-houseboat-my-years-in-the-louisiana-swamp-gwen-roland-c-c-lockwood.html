  <title>Atchafalaya Houseboat: My Years in the Louisiana Swamp - Gwen Roland, C. C. Lockwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the early 1970s, two idealistic young people -- Gwen Carpenter Roland and Calvin Voisin -- decided to leave civilization and re-create the vanished simple life of their great-grandparents in the heart of Louisiana&#39;s million-acre Atchafalaya River Basin Swamp. Armed with a box of crayons and a book called How to Build Your Home in the Woods, they drew up plans to recycle a slave-built structure into a houseboat. Without power tools or building experience they constructed a floating dwelling complete with a brick fireplace. Towed deep into the sleepy waters of Bloody Bayou, it was their home for eight years. This is the tale of the not-so-simple life they made together -- days spent fishing, trading, making wine, growing food, and growing up -- told by Gwen with grace, economy, and eloquence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after they took up swamp living, Gwen and Calvin met a young photographer named C. C. Lockwood, who shared their &quot;back to the earth&quot; values. His photographs of the couple going about their daily routine were published in National Geographic magazine, bringing them unexpected fame. More than a quarter of a century later, after Gwen and Calvin had long since parted, one of Lockwood&#39;s photos of them appeared in a National Geographic collector&#39;s edition entitled 100 Best Pictures Unpublished -- and kindled the interest of a new generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With quiet wisdom, Gwen recounts her eight-year voyage of discovery -- about swamp life, wildlife, and herself. A keen observer of both the natural world and the ways of human beings, she transports readers to an unfamiliar and exotic place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
