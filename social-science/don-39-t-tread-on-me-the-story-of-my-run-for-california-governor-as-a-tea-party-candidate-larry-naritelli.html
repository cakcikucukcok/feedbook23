  <title>Don&#39;t Tread on Me: The Story of My Run for California Governor as a Tea Party Candidate - Larry Naritelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New from Voices of the Tea Party. Deeply upset at the way the Republican Party abandoned its conservative base in the elections of 2008, Larry Naritelli had taken to yelling at his television, prompting his 13-year-old son to ask if there would be a revolution in the country. Naritelli responded by taking his son to a Tea Party protest, to teach him about the freedoms granted by our Constitution. Naritelli began speaking publicly about the government-imposed drought that was destroying California&amp;#8217;s farmers, creating 40% levels of unemployment, and depressing real estate values. In 2010, he ran against Meg Whitman for Governor as the Tea Party candidate, in the California Republican Primary in 2010. &lt;em&gt;Don&#39;t Tread on Me&lt;/em&gt; is the inside story of the making of a Tea Party gubernatorial candidate.&lt;/p&gt;" />
