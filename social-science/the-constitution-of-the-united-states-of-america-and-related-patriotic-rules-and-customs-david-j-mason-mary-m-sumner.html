  <title>The Constitution of the United States of America and Related Patriotic Rules and Customs - David J Mason, Mary M Sumner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ebooks are evolving and promoting more and more people to read. People are spending more time in front of screens and less time in front of printed books. With an ebook computer file and additional features available on eReader, the user can easily and quickly review, read, or just browse the ebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This eBook, &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Constitution of the United States of America and Related Patriotic Rules and Customs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, is an excellent choice for an eBook because of its coverage of civil liberties, such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom to assemble and the freedom to petition, which are rights that citizens continue to enjoy. The Constitution also provides citizens the right to possess firearms, the right to a public trial for criminal offenses, the right to question unusual punishment and the right to question property seizures and arrests without a warrant. This eBook edition of patriotic documents is perfect for public dialogue, discussion and engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Constitution of the United States of America and Related Patriotic Rules and Customs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, provides an easy-to-use version and convenient access to the U.S. Constitution and other patriotic documents. It is fully searchable and the user can quickly find information or look up what is established by the U.S. Constitution. The text has hyperlinked annotated revisions to endnotes for quick access to the annotation and return to the place the user was reading. To navigate the ebook, each article and amendment is hyperlinked in the table of contents for easier access to additional information. The Ebook reader will let the users tweak the style to suit their reading pleasure. Many ebooks readers allow you to change the font style, font size, page size, margin size, colors, and more. You can also bookmark your favorite amendment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As eBooks evolve and promote more people to read, they will inherently help American citizens maintain their guaranteed right civil liberties, such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom to assemble and the freedom to petition, which are rights that citizens continue to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
