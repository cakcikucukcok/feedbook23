  <title>The Kind of Old Man I Want to Be: A Paradigm for 65 and Beyond - Jack Chalk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you are middle age and beyond, you need to think about the kind of old person you will be because you will be one before you know it. The time to start is now, well before you reach 65 years of age. If you are already 65 or over it is not too late to change.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Every day 10,000 people in the US turn 65. They may have plans for doing things, but most are without a paradigm for being content if they do not have the financial means or health to do them. Using humorous quotes, antidotes and illustrations throughout the text, the author draws from a variety of disciplines to present a DIY paradigm for contentment in one&amp;rsquo;s old age. In this book contentment is presented as a product of the kind of person you are rather than a bi-product of what you do or the circumstances you are in.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book deals with writing the rest of one&amp;rsquo;s life story from your age today, the end of one&amp;rsquo;s life story (facing death and beyond), and putting meaning to one&amp;rsquo;s life story. Regardless of the circumstances, your life can have meaning and end well by adopting this paradigm.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
