  <title>Against Humanity - Sam Dubal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;&amp;ldquo;Gunya is a woman in her late twenties. Soldiers of the Lord&amp;rsquo;s Resistance Army (LRA) abducted her when she was eleven years old and forcefully conscripted her into the rebel ranks. Gunya spent a little over the decade with the rebels before deserting. While there, she gave birth to a son with Onen, an LRA soldier.

Dubal speaks with former LRA rebels as they find personal meaning in wartime violence, politics, and spirituality&amp;mdash;experiences that observers often place outside of the boundaries of humanity.&amp;#160; What emerges is an unorthodox and provocative question&amp;mdash;what would it mean to be truly against the idea of humaneness and benevolence?
