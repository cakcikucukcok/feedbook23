  <title>Eco-Freaks - John Berlau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tree-huggers may actually be squeezing the life out of the environment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a book that is alternately alarming, enlightening, ironic, and entertaining, award-winning journalist John Berlau explores the myriad ways in which shortsighted environmentalism actually endangers trees, wildlife, and people. In chapter after chapter, Berlau debunks myths and libels about: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;global warming and climate change&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the dangers of pesticides like DDT&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;trees and pollution&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;fuel economy and the auto industry&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the threat posed by asbestos&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;the lifesaving role of dams and levees&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;plans to &quot;rewild&quot; America&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mother Nature is not a gentle person, and Berlau&#39;s pointed reporting reveals the very real dangers to people and their environments when Eco-Freaks prevent us from restraining her. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Berlau makes a powerful case. . . . Thinking environmentalists who read this book will be forced to revisit at least some of their most deeply held beliefs.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Joel Himelfarb, &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Berlau says a lot of things that are not generally known that needed to be said.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-&lt;strong&gt;Bruce N. Ames, recipient, National Medal of Science, 1998&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save the Planet . . . and Ourselves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Eco-Freaks&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning journalist John Berlau provides a much needed and startling exposé about how the environmental movement with its radical, shortsighted eco-activists has actually helped amplify the dangers of natural disasters and destroyed the lives and property of millions of Americans. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Berlau writes, &quot;America . . . is still mighty prosperous, but environmentalism is putting us on the brink of danger as well. As technology after technology that our grandparents put in place is being banned, and new technologies never even come to market, we risk a public-health disaster. Environmentalists have promoted all sorts of doomsday scenarios about population explosions and massive cancer crises from pesticides that have been shown to be false. But now, because we have done away with so many useful products based on those scares, we are in danger of an old-fashion doomsday returning, because we&#39;ve lost what protected us from the wrath of nature. Indeed, as we will see throughout this book, public health hazards caused by environmental policies are already on the scene.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
