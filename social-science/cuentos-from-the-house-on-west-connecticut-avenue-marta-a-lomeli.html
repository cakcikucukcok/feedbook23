  <title>Cuentos from the House on West Connecticut Avenue - Marta A. Lomeli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cuentos from the House on West Connecticut Avenue&lt;/em&gt; 
  began as a writing exercise in a teachers seminar. The assignment was 
  to write about your first house with as much detail as possible. As I wrote, 
  I remembered and began to lose track of time. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;That is how the first story, The Bottom Drawer, 
  came into existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Were there more stories in me? Ones that others could relate 
  to? Oh, yes! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;In And Then Came Eloisa you will remember the 
  houseguest that overstayed her welcome. The Green American blends 
  comedy and sadness in dealing with the subject of racism. The two Christmas 
  stories that are included are examples of how some families deal with the challenges 
  of maintaining important values and allowing for change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Hysterically funny and always thought provoking, &lt;em&gt;Cuentos&lt;/em&gt; 
  lets you experience what it was like growing up eating rice and beans and believing 
  that you could teach others to fly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Filled with rich, evocative language, each story lets you see 
  how the future is shaped by how we see our past.&lt;br&gt;
