  <title>Citizen and Subject - Mahmood Mamdani, Mahmood Mamdani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this acclaimed book, Mahmood Mamdani offers a provocative reinterpretation of late-colonial Africa and how its legacy continues to hamper democracy in the post-independence era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That legacy, Mamdani argues, is a bifurcated power that mediates racial domination through tribally organized local authorities, reproducing racial identity in citizens and ethnic identity in subjects. Direct rule, indirect rule, and apartheid were varieties of a single despotism. While direct rule denied rights to subjects on racial grounds, indirect rule incorporated &amp;#8216;natives&#39; into a &quot;customary&quot; mode of rule, with state-appointed native authorities defining custom and tapping the authoritarian possibilities of culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through case studies of resistance movements in Uganda and South Africa, Mamdani shows how these defining aspects of colonial power still play out today in African states that fragment opposition by enforcing tensions between ethnicities and between town and country. The result is a groundbreaking reassessment of colonial rule in Africa and its enduring aftereffects.&lt;/p&gt;" />
