  <title>The Rehnquist Court: A Retrospective - Martin H. Belsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1986, the Supreme Courts leading conservative, William H. Rehnquist, labeled by Newsweek as The Courts Mr. Right, was made Chief Justice.  Almost immediately, legal scholars, practitioners, and pundits began questioning what his influence would be, and whether he would remake our constitutional corpus in his own image.  Would the center hold, or fold? This collected volume, edited by Martin H. Belsky, is the third in a series which includes   The Warren Court and The Burger Court, both edited by Bernard Schwartz.  It gathers together a distinguished group of scholars, journalists, judges, and practitioners to reflect on the fifteen-year impact of the Rehnquist Court.  The work provides an overview of the Rehnquist Courts influence to date, examines in detail the seminal issues confronted by the Court, and places the Court in broad historical perspective. Subjects discussed include First Amendment rights and cyberspace, criminal justice reform, the Courts pattern of constitutional interpretation, the international impact of the Rehnquist Court, and the Supreme Courts increasing interaction with state constitutional law.  A comprehensive look at the significant shifts in constitutional jurisprudence under Rehnquists leadership, this volume illustrates how the Rehnquist Court has brought us almost full-circle from the judge-made revolution of the Warren Court. A must-have for all students of the Court and legal history, this book contains fascinating insights into one of the centurys most controversial courts and a legacy still in the making." />
