  <title>Dominant Wives Society and Their Cuckold Husbands Volume 9 - Candy Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was home for a couple of hours and then I heard the front door open and Anna came inside. I heard her giggling and another man&#39;s voice. I was in the guest room, just in case she did bring a man home with her.    &quot;So, are you married?&quot; I heard the stranger&#39;s voice say.    &quot;No way. You think a man can tame me long enough to marry me?&quot; Anna said in her sultry voice I immediately recognized. She had used it on me many times before.     &quot;You&#39;re so damn hot.&quot; The stranger said. I knew my Anna was hot. She always gathered stares from men who looked at her for the first time. It was hard to take your eyes away from her.    I walked to the top of the stairs and watched as they held each other and kissed. I was beginning to feel jealous. I guess when she said she wanted sex with other men, I didn&#39;t fathom that kissing would be involved. But, then I thought to myself, of course it would be. It goes along with sex. I just thought in my mind that kissing was intimate." />
