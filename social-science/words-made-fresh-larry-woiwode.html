  <title>Words Made Fresh - Larry Woiwode</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Larry Woiwode frames this new collection of essays in the language of the incarnation, the event that shows &amp;ldquo;how a metaphor of words could contain the lineaments and inner workings of a human being.&amp;rdquo; The essays that follow do just that. Through the medium of literary analysis, cultural reflection, and personal memory, they trace Woiwode&amp;rsquo;s work and thought as well as that of the vivid human beings he depicts. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These essays, all revised and reworked since their original publication, include reflections on Scripture translation, the place of religion in education, how John Updike&amp;rsquo;s work reflects the theology of S&amp;oslash;ren Kierkegaard and Karl Barth, and the difference between the news as delivered by CNN and Bob Dylan. Woiwode ranges over these topics with deliberate thoughtfulness, a Christian engaged with the wounds and gifts of the world. He also does so with the care of a writer for whom &amp;ldquo;the Word is home.&amp;rdquo; The shape of that Word sets the pattern for what he has written here: not &amp;ldquo;a set of rules to regulate social behavior,&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;an ordering of stories . . . with glimpses into character.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
