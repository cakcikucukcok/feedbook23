  <title>As Black as Resistance - Zoé Samudzi, William C. Anderson, Mariame Kaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The essay &quot;The Anarchism of Blackness&quot; appeared in issue #5 of &lt;i&gt;ROAR Magazine&lt;/i&gt; this April (as well as on ROAR&#39;s website: https://roarmag.org/magazine/black-liberation-anti-fascism/). It made a splash and was reposted and shared widely. The authors responded favorably to the idea of expanding the essay into a book. The book is presented as a complement to titles like &lt;i&gt;From #BlackLivesMatter to Black Liberation&lt;/i&gt; (Haymarket, 2016) and other contemporary titles looking at liberation from a Black perspective. &lt;i&gt;As Black as Resistance&lt;/i&gt; isn&#39;t an &quot;anarchist&quot; book in the sense of its message being self-marginalizing. We think the tone and lessons will resonate far and wide." />

I usually have some pretty strong critiques about academic social justice focused writing.<br /><b><i>As Black as Resistance: Finding the Conditions for ...</i></b> | As Black as Resistance is a declaration for everyone who is ready to continue progressing towards liberation for all people.
