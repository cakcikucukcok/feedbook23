  <title>Travel the World with London-Victoria - Conchita Leeflang, Frances Espa単ol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Travel the World with London Victoria is about a little four-year-old girl named London Victoria, who travels with her friends from all over the world. London-Victoria has parents from two different continents, a mother from Suriname and a father from Germany, and she was born In the USA. Its very easy to see why her friends are all different and still love as one.
Tai, Sebrina, Joylin, Frido, Soraja, and Zachary are all her best friends who travel with her, and she cant wait to tell you about all of them. She wants to teach you about the people, the food, and the language in a fun-loving way. As a treat, you will also get a recipe and a song and learn some words in different languages. The most important thing for London Victoria is for the kids to have fun and discover their own culture, where they are from, where the parents and grandparents are from, and what their favorite food and snacks are. That helps them build a personal relationship with their culture. Children are encouraged to ask their parents questions about their past, because the parents love to tell them all about how and where they grew up.
Enjoy, have fun, and dont forget that its all filled with love, like silly little LV would say.
