  <title>Get out of Jena - Levi M. Hatcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Get Out Of Jena takes a look into the conditions that makes for racial divides to persist in any modern day American society that refuses to acknowledge the contributions that any race makes to that society.
	Through the real life experiences of a family from LaSalle Parish, Louisiana- where Jena is the parish seat- we can see how such conditions- when ignored- can create a hostile situation. In North American society we cannot over look the crippling effects of slaverys contribution to these conditions.  How it affects economic struggles, attitudes and the pride of a people, on both sides of the color line.  
	Get Out Of Jena does not lay the responsibility to change these conditions on the shoulders of any one race or people.  Therefore the adults of both sides contribute to these conditions, either by submission or omission.  In the end we will see how it is the youth that pay a bigger price for the arrogance of those conditioned adults. The price they pay for their refusal to acknowledge the importance of all its citizens.  
	The question this book asks is can any of us run away from that responsibility, no matter how large or small we think our responsibility is. And if we do run away, where would we go, and will we ever be called back to deal with the conditions we left behind." />

    	<p>Get Out Of Jena takes a look into the conditions that makes for racial divides to persist in any modern day American society that refuses to acknowledge the contributions that any race makes to that society. Through the real life experiences of a family from LaSalle Parish, Louisiana- where Jena is the parish seat- we can see how such conditions- when ignored- can create a hostile situation. In North American society we cannot over look the crippling effects of slaverys contribution to these conditions. How it affects economic struggles, attitudes and the pride of a people, on both sides of the color line. Get Out Of Jena does not lay the responsibility to change these conditions on the shoulders of any one race or people. Therefore the adults of both sides contribute to these conditions, either by submission or omission. In the end we will see how it is the youth that pay a bigger price for the arrogance of those conditioned adults. The price they pay for their refusal to acknowledge the importance of all its citizens. The question this book asks is can any of us run away from that responsibility, no matter how large or small we think our responsibility is. And if we do run away, where would we go, and will we ever be called back to deal with the conditions we left behind.</p>
