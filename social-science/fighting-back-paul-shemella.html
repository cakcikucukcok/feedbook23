  <title>Fighting Back - Paul Shemella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since terrorism became a global national security issue in the new millennium, all governments have wrestled with its effects.  Yet strong measures against terrorism have often made the root causes of the problem worse, while weak responses have invited further attack. In response, this book explains how governments can construct and execute the most effective strategies to combat terrorism—and how they can manage the consequences of those acts of terrorism they cannot prevent.
It provides an overview of the complex problem of terrorism and offers a guide to shaping solutions to fit the unique structures and processes of governments.  These issues and their solutions are demonstrated in six case studies. The book&#39;s value lies in its holistic treatment of what governments can do to protect their societies, with the ultimate goal of reducing terrorism from the global security threat it is today to a national-level criminal problem.
Written by a team of experts, the book offers a concise but complete course on the most important national security challenge of our time." />
