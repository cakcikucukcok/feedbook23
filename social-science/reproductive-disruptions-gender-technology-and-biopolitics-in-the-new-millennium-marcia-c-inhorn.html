  <title>Reproductive Disruptions: Gender, Technology, and Biopolitics in the New Millennium - Marcia C. Inhorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; 	&lt;b&gt;Nominated for the 2007 Book Prize by the Council on Anthropology and Reproduction (AAA)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 	Reproductive disruptions, such as infertility, pregnancy loss, adoption, and childhood disability, are among the most distressing experiences in people&#39;s lives. Based on research by leading medical anthropologists from around the world, this book examines such issues as local practices detrimental to safe pregnancy and birth; conflicting reproductive goals between women and men; miscommunications between pregnant women and their genetic counselors; cultural anxieties over gamete donation and adoption; the contested meanings of abortion; cultural critiques of hormone replacement therapy; and the globalization of new pharmaceutical and assisted reproductive technologies. This breadth - with its explicit move from the &quot;local&quot; to the &quot;global,&quot; from the realm of everyday reproductive practice to international programs and policies - illuminates most effectively the workings of power, the tensions between women&#39;s and men&#39;s reproductive agency, and various cultural and structural inequalities in reproductive health.&lt;/p&gt;" />
