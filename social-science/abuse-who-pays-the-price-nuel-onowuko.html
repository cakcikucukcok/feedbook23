  <title>Abuse: Who Pays the Price? - Nuel Onowuko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone suffers and pays the price for abuse directly or indirectly, but the degree to which we respond is largely determined by our knowledge of the abuse-creating stimuli (real or abstract) and how to break the circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were you abused as a child? Are you being abused and you do not know it? Are you perpetuating an abuse without knowing you are? Are you being swept along with the pleasure-mad throng of an abusive environmental influence and think it normal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you bound in an abuse in your quest for freedom? Do you consistently rationalize your error even when conscience tells you that you are wrong? Do you appropriate abuse to inanimate objects or other people without a reference to self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who pays the price for the abuse that occurred years back, and why has the price for an abusive thought, a seemingly innocent act, become so heavy a burden to bear? Are your actions, positive or negative, creating definite objective stimuli those little feet behind you are sure to follow? How do you deal with that thing that takes over for you when you do not want to repeat this abuse?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer to these questions and many others are the information contained in this material aimed at helping you demystify abuse. It is my ultimate desire that this book ends all your search and research for compulsive abuse and abusive stimulants.&lt;/p&gt;" />
