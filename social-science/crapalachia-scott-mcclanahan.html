  <title>Crapalachia - Scott McClanahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;McClanahan&#39;s prose is miasmic, dizzying, repetitive.

McClanahan&amp;#8217;s prose is straightforward, casual, and enjoyable to read, reminiscent at times of Kurt Vonnegut. &lt;I&gt;Crapalachia&lt;/I&gt; is one of the rare books that, after you reach the end, you don&amp;#8217;t get up to check your e-mail or Facebook or watch TV. You just sit quietly and think about the people of the book and how they remind you of people you used to know. You feel lucky to have known them, and you feel grateful to McClanahan for the reminder.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;Rain Taxi Review of Books&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Scott McClanahan was fourteen he went to live with his Grandma Ruby and his Uncle Nathan, who suffered from cerebral palsy. &lt;I&gt;Crapalachia&lt;/I&gt; is a portrait of these formative years, coming-of-age in rural West Virginia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peopled by colorful characters and their quirky stories, &lt;I&gt;Crapalachia&lt;/I&gt; interweaves oral folklore and area history, providing an ambitious and powerful snapshot of overlooked Americana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Scott McClanahan&lt;/B&gt; is the author of &lt;I&gt;Stories II&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Stories V!&lt;/I&gt; His fiction has appeared in &lt;I&gt;BOMB&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Vice&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;New York Tyrant&lt;/I&gt;.
