  <title>X and Why - Tom Whipple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gender is shifting. But is gender disappearing? This is the story of where biology meets behaviour – how sex drives us, and informs so many of the key choices we make in life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last century it was argued that men are from Mars and women are from Venus - but things have moved on a long way since then. In this timely new approach to the debate, Tom Whipple travels far and wide - from a Home Counties swingers&#39; party to a gay penguin sanctuary in Germany - and draws on the latest studies in behavioural science as well as fascinating explorations into anthropology to present a surprising tale of expectations and mismatches.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are currently single, this book is about your place in the dating market - your successes, your failures and what they mean. If you are in a relationship, it is about why you chose the person you are with, why they chose you - and the circumstances in which either of you might put it all at risk and stray.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;X and Why&lt;/i&gt;, Tom Whipple delves into the sexual subconscious to explain the inner workings of character and desire. It will change the way you see yourself and everyone around you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;This &lt;b&gt;witty, racily-written book will ruffle some feathers&lt;/b&gt;. Some feathers need to be ruffled. Tom Whipple does it with &lt;b&gt;panache and style&lt;/b&gt;.&#39; &lt;b&gt;RICHARD DAWKINS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;The science of sexuality is almost too interesting to read and write about, inviting cheap jokes and heavy-handed politicising. But &lt;b&gt;Tom Whipple hits the spot&lt;/b&gt;, and presents the latest thinking and research with &lt;b&gt;depth, wit and balance&lt;/b&gt;.&#39; &lt;b&gt;STEVEN PINKER&lt;/b&gt;, Johnstone Professor of Psychology, Harvard University, and author of &lt;i&gt;How the Mind Works&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Enlightenment Now&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
