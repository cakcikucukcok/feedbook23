  <title>Talking to a Brick Wall - Deborah Mattinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With a foreword by Michael Portillo. Deborah Mattinson had a unique perspective on the New Labour project. As Britain&#39;s leading political pollster, she has been monitoring public opinion since the mid-1980s, and helped transform Labour into Europe&#39;s greatest election-winning machine of the modern era. Most recently as chief pollster to Gordon Brown as Prime Minister, she has been on the frontline of electoral politics, consistently representing the voter&#39;s side of the story to the politicans. Sometimes, she has encountered scepticism - a belligerent John Smith made an unappreciative witness to one of Deborah&#39;s focus groups - and she has often had to convey unwelcome results - telling a grumpy Gordon Brown he needed to spruce up his appearance cannot have been easy. With a stellar cast, including Neil Kinnock, Peter Mandelson, John Smith, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Talking to A Brick Wall reviews the New Labour years from the voter&#39;s point of view. It tracks the ups and downs of the Blair/Brown era as seen from beyond Westminster, showing how closely political reputation correlates with voter connection. It profiles the swing voter, shows the importance of women&#39;s votes, and what gives a politician popular appeal, and maps the voters&#39; views through the 2010 campaign and its immediate aftermath, showing how the electorate has been left out of political decision making and revealing the public&#39;s recipe for rehabilitating the Labour Party and rebuilding trust in democracy. A champion of democratic renewal through citizen engagement, Deborah Mattinson believes that we must move to new grown up partnership politics if democracy is to thrive." />
