  <title>The New American Revolution - Tammy Bruce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New American Revolution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;A controversial and powerful manifesto for twenty-first-century American Patriots&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#39;s time to swing back the curtains and invite the light in. And that light is American Nationalism, perennially shunned by the Left, condemned by Socialists, and without any special interest group fighting for its rebirth. It has no legitimate advocates. And yet it is the very idea that will save not only our nation, but the rest of the world as well,&quot; declares Tammy Bruce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this remarkable book, the bestselling author, activist, and independent pundit pulls no punches, illustrating how a new American revolution is upon us -- a revolution based on American Nationalism and Individualism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grounded in reason, classical philosophy, and hard-earned experience, Bruce explores the dramatic shift in American attitudes since the tragedy of September 11. She illustrates how in our effort to take this nation back from nihilistic extremists, American Nationalism, individualism, gun ownership, the tearing down of liberal institutions, personal activism, and knowing the enemy are the new tools for today&#39;s Patriot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Hate America First&quot; ideology has prevailed for far too long, says Bruce, and she now offers a powerful prescription to reverse the moral and cultural decay wrought by Leftist extremists for four decades. This power to stem the tide resides squarely within the reawakened American founding concept of &lt;em&gt;E Pluribus Unum&lt;/em&gt;, or &quot;Out of Many, One.&quot; It is this ingrained individualist spirit of the average American that makes this country the best nation on earth, and now fuels the noble fight against the scourge of the Collectivist Left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a positive framework with empowering ideas, insight, and tools for direct action, Bruce has captured a watershed moment in American history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
