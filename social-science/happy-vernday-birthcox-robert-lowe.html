  <title>Happy Vernday Birthcox - Robert Lowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sex! Drugs! Rock and Roll! It was bogus labeling! Humans have always engaged in sex, drugs, and music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story begins with a journey through The Robin Williams Tunnel (formerly The&amp;nbsp;Waldo, or Rainbow&amp;nbsp;Tunnel). It&amp;nbsp;is about the wholehearted pursuit of life; about striving to live without limits. It is a story of revelation, of trial and tribulation, of revolution and evolution, of exploration, and continual re-evaluation, often with agonizing re-appraisal. It is a story composed of emotion and memory, of seeking meaning and sharing realities of human triumph and tribulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Anselmo, California&amp;nbsp;is a little town in Marin County, California, 18 miles north, and a little west of the Golden Gate Bridge. The land and air in this paradise are rich beyond delight and the richness has rested upon the people who have been blessed by that gentle bit of earth since the Miwok Indians first hunted and fished among the semi-arid, Live Oak covered hills. It has a near perfect climate protected by Mt. Tamalpais and Bolinas Ridge deflecting cold summer weather from the Pacific Ocean dragged into the bay region by the Central California San Joaquin valley heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As San Francisco was &lt;em&gt;The City&lt;/em&gt;, Marin was &lt;em&gt;The County&lt;/em&gt;. The histories of City and County are of equally unique richness and beauty, blessed by creativity and excellence, and rife with excesses of money, power, talent, genius, inspiration, beauty in nature and people; excesses of wonder, and delight, as well as of sex, drugs, rock and roll, corruption, and terror. The history of this unusual place and time is also filled with wild explorations, human foible, interesting stories, and exceptional people. Vernon Cox being outstanding among them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
