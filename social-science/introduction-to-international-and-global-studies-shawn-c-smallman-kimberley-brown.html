  <title>Introduction to International and Global Studies - Shawn C. Smallman, Kimberley Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This innovative introduction to international and global studies offers instructors in both the humanities and the social sciences an up-to-date and comprehensive approach to teaching undergraduates in this rapidly growing interdisciplinary field. Shawn Smallman and Kimberley Brown first present students with the key concepts necessary to understand the intellectual and structural underpinnings of globalization. Thoughtfully building the presentation of core themes--including the history of globalization; economic, political, and cultural globalization; security; energy; and development--the authors examine such timely topics as commodity chains, labor, human rights, and multinational corporations, and provide keen insights into more familiar themes, such as food, health and disease, and the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Smallman and Brown focus on teaching students about global citizenship while emphasizing the development of skills for critical thinking and understanding differing viewpoints. Explaining the historical roots of current challenges and discussing engaging real-life cases, they encourage students to understand their local context from a global perspective and to develop their abilities to negotiate a rapidly changing world. A chapter on what students can do with a degree in international and global studies includes a planning guide for postgraduate career and academic choices. The textbook includes maps and illustrations, and, at the end of each chapter, a glossary, questions for reflection, and student activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An online teacher&#39;s manual is available for those adopting the textbook. It includes sample examination questions, additional resources for each chapter, and recommendations for adaptations for students with particular learning needs including those students whose first language is not English.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
