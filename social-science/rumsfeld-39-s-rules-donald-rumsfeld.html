  <title>Rumsfeld&#39;s Rules - Donald Rumsfeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The man once named one of America&amp;#8217;s ten &amp;#8220;toughest&amp;#8221; CEOs by &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; magazine offers current and future leaders practical advice on how to make their companies and organizations more effective.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout his distinguished career&amp;#8212;as a naval aviator, a U.S. Congressman, a top aide to four American presidents, a high-level diplomat, a CEO of two Fortune 500 companies, and the only twice-serving Secretary of Defense in American history&amp;#8212;Donald Rumsfeld has collected hundreds of pithy, compelling, and often humorous observations about leadership, business, and life.
