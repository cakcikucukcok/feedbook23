  <title>Finding North - George Michelsen Foy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Navigation is the key human skill. It&#39;s something we do everywhere, whether feeling our way through a bedroom in the dark, or charting a ship&#39;s course. But how does navigation affect our brains, our memory, ourselves? Blending scientific research and memoir, and written in beautiful prose, &lt;i&gt;Finding North&lt;/i&gt; starts with a quest by the author to understand this most basic of human skills---and why it&#39;s in mortal peril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1844, Foy&#39;s great-great grandfather, captain of a Norwegian cargo ship, perished at sea after getting lost in a snowstorm. Foy decides to unravel the mystery surrounding Halvor Michelsen&#39;s death---and the roots of his own obsession with navigation---by re-creating his ancestor&#39;s trip using only period instruments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beforehand, he meets a colorful cast of characters to learn whether men really have better directional skills than women, how cells, eels, and spaceships navigate; and how tragedy results from GPS glitches. He interviews a cabby who has memorized every street in London, sails on a Haitian cargo sloop, and visits the site of a secret navigational cult in Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of Foy&#39;s story is this fact: navigation and the brain&#39;s memory centers are inextricably linked. As Foy unravels the secret behind Halvor&#39;s death, he also discovers why forsaking our navigation skills in favor of GPS may lead not only to Alzheimers and other diseases of memory, but to losing a key part of what makes us human.&lt;/p&gt;" />
