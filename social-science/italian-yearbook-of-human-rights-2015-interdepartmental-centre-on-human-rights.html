  <title>Italian Yearbook of Human Rights 2015 - Interdepartmental Centre on Human Rights</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The &lt;I&gt;Italian Yearbook of Human Rights 2015 &lt;/I&gt;provides a dynamic and up-to-date overview of the measures Italy has taken to adapt its legislation and policies to international human rights law and to comply with commitments voluntarily assumed by the Italian Government at the international level.&lt;BR&gt; The 2015 &lt;I&gt;Yearbook &lt;/I&gt;surveys the activities of the relevant national and local Italian actors, including governmental bodies, civil society organisations and universities. It also presents reports and recommendations that have been addressed to Italy in 2014 by international monitoring bodies within the framework of the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Union. Finally, the &lt;I&gt;Yearbook &lt;/I&gt;provides a selection of international and national case-law that casts light on Italy’s position vis-à-vis internationally recognised human rights.&lt;BR&gt; «Italy and Human Rights in 2014: the Challenge of National/International Constitutional Synergism» is the focus of the introductory section of the Yearbook. The complex network of monitoring actions carried out by the supranational bodies, and the relative reporting requirements Italy must meet, can only be viewed in the context of reciprocal exchange and strengthening between the provisions enshrined in the national Constitution and international human rights law.&lt;BR&gt; The Italian Agenda of Human Rights 2015 represents an updated orientation tool intended to support the commitment taken by the Italian Government in the framework of the second Universal Periodic Review (October 2014) before the UN Human Rights Council." />
