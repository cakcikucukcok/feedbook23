  <title>Anatomy of the Red Brigades - Alessandro Orsini, Sarah J. Nodes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The Red Brigades were a far-left terrorist group in Italy formed in 1970 and active all through the 1980s. Infamous around the world for a campaign of assassinations, kidnappings, and bank robberies intended as a &quot;concentrated strike against the heart of the State,&quot; the Red Brigades&#39; most notorious crime was the kidnapping and murder of Italy&#39;s former prime minister Aldo Moro in 1978. In the late 1990s, a new group of violent anticapitalist terrorists revived the name Red Brigades and killed a number of professors and government officials. Like their German counterparts in the Baader-Meinhof Group and today&#39;s violent political and religious extremists, the Red Brigades and their actions raise a host of questions about the motivations, ideologies, and mind-sets of people who commit horrific acts of violence in the name of a utopia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the first English edition of a book that has won critical acclaim and major prizes in Italy, Alessandro Orsini contends that the dominant logic of the Red Brigades was essentially eschatological, focused on purifying a corrupt world through violence. Only through revolutionary terror, Brigadists believed, could humanity be saved from the putrefying effects of capitalism and imperialism. Through a careful study of all existing documentation produced by the Red Brigades and of all existing scholarship on the Red Brigades, Orsini reconstructs a worldview that can be as seductive as it is horrifying. Orsini has devised a micro-sociological theory that allows him to reconstruct the group dynamics leading to political homicide in extreme-left and neonazi terrorist groups. This &quot;subversive-revolutionary feedback theory&quot; states that the willingness to mete out and suffer death depends, in the last analysis, on how far the terrorist has been incorporated into the revolutionary sect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Orsini makes clear that this political-religious concept of historical development is central to understanding all such self-styled &quot;purifiers of the world.&quot; From Thomas Müntzer&#39;s theocratic dream to Pol Pot&#39;s Cambodian revolution, all the violent &quot;purifiers&quot; of the world have a clear goal: to build a perfect society in which there will no longer be any sin and unhappiness and in which no opposition can be allowed to upset the universal harmony. Orsini&#39;s book reconstructs the origins and evolution of a revolutionary tradition brought into our own times by the Red Brigades.&lt;/p&gt;" />
