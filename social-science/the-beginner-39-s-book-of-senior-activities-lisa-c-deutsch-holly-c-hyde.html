  <title>The Beginner&#39;s Book of Senior Activities - Lisa C. Deutsch, Holly C Hyde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;About 13 percent of Americans are sixty-five or older, according to the most recent census. As baby boomers continue to age, retirement communities and senior living centers will need to expand to meet their needs. Today&amp;rsquo;s modern seniors are looking for social events and challenging educational opportunities close to home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Book of Senior Activities&lt;/em&gt; provides dozens of ideas for entertainment, themed parties, low-key gatherings, and scripture-based activities to help event coordinators and ministers plan exciting, diverse programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is well organized, with three event suggestions per month. A detailed description, decorating ideas, recommended Bible readings, jokes, games, video clip options, and more accompany each activity idea. A handy appendix includes 116 pages of&amp;nbsp;ready-to-copy word games, trivia quizzes, crossword puzzles, and other handouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing specific activity ideas, the book provides step-by-step instructions for setting up a recreational program tailored to your group&amp;rsquo;s needs and interests. Also included is a lengthy list of volunteer opportunities that can keep seniors active and engaged in their communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This easy-to-use, faith-based guide will be indispensable&amp;nbsp;for anyone responsible for planning enriching social events for nursing homes, retirement communities, church groups for older adults, and senior day care centers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
