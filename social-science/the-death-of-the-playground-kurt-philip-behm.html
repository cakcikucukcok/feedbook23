  <title>The Death of the Playground - Kurt Philip Behm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Death Of The Playground talks about the tragic loss of &#39;Free-Play&#39; in America.  Our Public Playgrounds were the places where it all happened, where developing boys could learn together to,
: First sit and watch and learn from those older
: Truly become an important part of a group and fit in
: Make up their own games and improvise
: That to have friends you must first be a friend
: Handle disappointment and that life isn&#39;t always fair
: Realize that all great things take time
: To become part of something bigger than just themselves
   THIS ONE WAS MOST IMPORTANT !
On the Playground, they did all of this without DIRECT Parent or Adult supervision.  They made up their own rules of play, picked their own games, decided for themselves what was fair, and learned to live with the consequences. 
 All of this doesn&#39;t mean Parents weren&#39;t involved; they were. They just weren&#39;t over-involved! 
Kids raised with their parents doing everything for them, then &#39;grow up&#39; and want their government to do the same thing. I think we all know where that road leads.
America&#39;s Corporations desperately need the developing titans, like the ones that fought and won two World Wars, created the powerful multi-national corporations, and wrote the great books of the 20th century. The chain connecting boyhood to manhood is now broken. Let me take you back to find the missing link.
Revisit with me the Playground of my childhood, and share with me the pure joy and magic of my 8 years of &#39;Free-Play.&#39; 
It&#39;s not too late to recapture that magic for our children, but we have to act and we have to act soon.
