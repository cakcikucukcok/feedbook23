  <title>Caring Across Generations - Grace J. Yoo, Barbara W. Kim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;More than 1.3 million Korean Americans live
in the United States, the majority of them foreign-born immigrants and their
children, the so-called 1.5 and second generations. While many sons and
daughters of Korean immigrants outwardly conform to the stereotyped image of
the upwardly mobile, highly educated super-achiever, the realities and
challenges that the children of Korean immigrants face in their adult lives as
their immigrant parents grow older and confront
health issues that are far more complex. In &lt;em&gt;Caring
Across Generations&lt;/em&gt;, Grace J. Yoo and Barbara W. Kim explore how earlier
experiences helping immigrant parents navigate American society have prepared Korean
American children for negotiating and redefining the traditional gender norms,
close familial relationships, and cultural practices that their parents expect
them to adhere to as they reach adulthood. Drawing on in-depth interviews with
137 second and 1.5 generation Korean Americans, Yoo &amp;amp; Kim explore issues
such as their childhood experiences, their interpreted cultural traditions and
values in regards to care and respect for the elderly, their attitudes and
values regarding care for aging parents, their observations of parents facing
retirement and life changes, and their experiences with providing care when
parents face illness or the prospects of dying. A unique study at the
intersection of immigration and aging, &lt;em&gt;Caring
Across Generations&lt;/em&gt; provides a new look at the linked lives of immigrants
and their families, and the struggles and triumphs that they face over many
generations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
