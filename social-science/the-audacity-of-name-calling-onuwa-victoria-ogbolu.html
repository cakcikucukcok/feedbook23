  <title>The Audacity of Name Calling - Onuwa Victoria Ogbolu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The current name-calling parading itself as political discourse has not only dominated American politics but also that of other nations. This ugly side of politics is threatening governance, impeding progress, and confusing the electorate. Disguised as a policy dialogue and dismissed as a political norm, name-calling is an endemic epidemic that has commandeered the real political agenda in America and it is more so in Obamas presidency. 
To dismiss vitriolic name-calling as an uncontrollable part of the political process, is to make a mockery of politics, destroy governance, and ultimately; it is an aberration of justice. Political name-calling is a sign of a serious ill within the larger society, especially when it plays a significant role in the outcome of elections and places uncooperative elected officials in a position of power.
Thus, the book documents and exposes the vicious political utterances of people, who abuse their political powers and thereby encourage hate, divisiveness, and perhaps violence. Further, it reminds the readers of politics gone severely wrong, of bigotry re-enacted, of democracy stretched to its limits, and of a freedom of speech abused. 
This book directs Americans and the world to the ills of name-calling and the political vindictiveness that results from it. It takes the stand that civility has to be reintroduced into politics if any sociopolitical catastrophe is to be averted. It is therefore hoped that by presenting a comprehensive documentation of ugly political practices so prevalent in todays politics, readers will have a written reference point that may allow them to fully understand the dangers and consequences of name-calling as infused into politics. 
After all, to remain on a political path to human destruction 
through a dogmatic selfish agenda is not sustainable." />
