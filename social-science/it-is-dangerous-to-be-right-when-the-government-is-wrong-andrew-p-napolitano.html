  <title>It Is Dangerous to Be Right When the Government Is Wrong - Andrew P. Napolitano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOES THE GOVERNMENT EXIST TO SERVE US OR TO MASTER US?&lt;/p&gt;If the government exists to serve us, and if freedom is part of our humanity, how can the government take freedom from us? &amp;nbsp;Is human freedom in America a myth, or is it reality? &amp;nbsp;The United States of America was born out of a bloody revolt against tyranny. &amp;nbsp;Yet almost from its inception, the government here has suppressed liberty. &amp;nbsp;Within the pages of &lt;i&gt;It Is Dangerous To Be Right When The Government Is Wrong&lt;/i&gt;, New York Times best-selling author Judge Andrew P. Napolitano lays out the case that the U.S. government, whose first obligation is to protect and preserve individual freedoms, actually does neither.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The judge offers eye-opening, sometimes frightening examples of how, time and again, the human liberties we are guaranteed in the Constitution are vanishing before our eyes. &amp;nbsp;He asks: where does freedom come from? &amp;nbsp;How can government in America exercise power that the people have not given to it? What forces have collaborated to destroy personal freedom? This back-to-basics on freedom addresses hard questions:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What is a Constitution, and do we still have one?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What are the limits to government power in a free society?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why does the government attack, rather than defend, our rights?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;If our rights are inalienable, how can the government take them away?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do we really own any private property?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;America is at a fundamental crossroads. &amp;nbsp;There are stirrings in the land and a cry that &quot;enough is enough.&quot; &amp;nbsp;The stories within these pages are told to help reawaken the natural human thirst for freedom-to point out government interference with natural order and the disastrous consequences that follow.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
