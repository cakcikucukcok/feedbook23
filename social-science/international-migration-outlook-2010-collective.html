  <title>International Migration Outlook 2010 - Collective</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This annual publication analyses recent developments in migration movements and policies in OECD countries. It looks at the contribution of immigration to changes in the working-age population in the past decade, and the role of migration inflows at projected levels in driving growth of the working-age population in the next decade. It presents information on  international students, including a first attempt to calculate the rates at which these students remain in their host countries after the completion of their studies.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This publication also explores the main changes introduced in migration policies, including new laws governing  immigrant entry, stay and access to the labour market. The selective recruitment of immigrants according to labour market needs and points-based systems is described, as well as measures to facilitate the integration of immigrants. International co-operation to improve border control and to combat irregular migration is analysed in detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of the economic crisis on the labour market outcomes of immigrants is examined, taking into consideration gender, sectors of employment and different types of contracts, as well as the demographic dynamics of native and foreign-born populations during the period under review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader will also find in this book two special chapters on topical issues. The first addresses the determinants of public opinion regarding migration, reviewing opinion surveys to identify individual determinants and examining the role of different stakeholders in shaping opinion.  The second chapter presents an in-depth study of the impact of naturalisation on the labour market outcomes of immigrants, exploring how acquisition of citizenship can increase opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Country notes, together with standardised tables, describe recent developments in migration movements and policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statistical annex contains the latest data on migration flows, foreign and foreign-born populations, and naturalisations. This book includes StatLinks, URLs under statistical graphs and tables linking to the underlying statistical data.&lt;/p&gt;" />
