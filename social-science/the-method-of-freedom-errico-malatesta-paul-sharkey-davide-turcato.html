  <title>The Method of Freedom - Errico Malatesta, Paul Sharkey, Davide Turcato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For sixty years, Errico Malatesta&#39;s involvement with international anarchism helped fuel the movement&#39;s radical approach to class and labor, and directly impacted the workers&#39; movement in Italy. A talented newspaper journalist, Malatesta&#39;s biting critiques were frequently short and to the point&amp;#151;and written directly to and for the workers. Though his few long-form essays, including &quot;Anarchy&quot; and &quot;Our Program,&quot; have been widely available in English translation since the 1950s, the bulk of Malatesta&#39;s most revolutionary writing remains unknown to English-speaking audiences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;I&gt;The Method of Freedom&lt;/I&gt;, editor Davide Turcato presents an expansive collection of Malatesta&#39;s work, including new translations of existing works and a wealth of shorter essays translated here for the first time. Offering readers a thorough overview of the evolution of Malatesta&#39;s revolutionary thought during his half a century as an anarchist propagandist, &lt;I&gt;The Method of Freedom&lt;/I&gt; explores revolutionary violence and workplace democracy, the general strike and the limitations of trade unionism, propaganda by the deed, and the revolution in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Errico Malatesta&lt;/B&gt; (1853&amp;#150;1932) was an enormously popular Italian anarchist, perhaps most well-known for his strong support of direct action and the general strike. A talented newspaper journalist and editor, Malatesta spent much of his life exiled from Italy because of his political beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Davide Turcato&lt;/B&gt; is a computational linguist and an independent historian. He is the author of &lt;I&gt;Making Sense of Anarchism&lt;/I&gt; and the editor of Malatesta&#39;s collected works, a ten-volume project currently underway in Italy, to be released in English by AK Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
