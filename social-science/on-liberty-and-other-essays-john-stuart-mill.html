  <title>On Liberty and Other Essays - John Stuart Mill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume, containing Mill&#39;s &quot;On Liberty&quot;, &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;, &quot;Considerations of Representative Government&quot;, and &quot;The Subjection of Women&quot;, draws together the basic ideas of liberalism that, although radical in their time, have gained recognition as comprehensive and relevant fundamentals of government, economics, and logic. Since the publication of &quot;On Liberty&quot; in 1859, no other nineteenth century philosopher has delved so deeply into the implications of independence from the state and what it means to be truly free. The four works contained here are accessible texts that clearly delineate Mill&#39;s philosophies, the most remarkable of which are the basis for liberty as the sovereignty of man over his own body and mind, Mill&#39;s famous &quot;Harm Principle,&quot; true and false democratic government, and equality of the sexes." />
