  <title>Crescent City Girls - LaKisha Michelle Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What was it like to grow up black and female in the segregated South? To answer this question, LaKisha Simmons blends social history and cultural studies, recreating children&#39;s streets and neighborhoods within Jim Crow New Orleans and offering a rare look into black girls&#39; personal lives. Simmons argues that these children faced the difficult task of adhering to middle-class expectations of purity and respectability even as they encountered the daily realities of Jim Crow violence, which included interracial sexual aggression, street harassment, and presumptions of black girls&#39; impurity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simmons makes use of oral histories, the black and white press, social workers&#39; reports, police reports, girls&#39; fiction writing, and photography to tell the stories of individual girls: some from poor, working-class families; some from middle-class, &quot;respectable&quot; families; and some caught in the Jim Crow judicial system. These voices come together to create a group biography of ordinary girls living in an extraordinary time, girls who did not intend to make history but whose stories transform our understanding of both segregation and childhood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
