  <title>Freefare - Mark A. Kovel Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Franklin D. Roosevelt changed America forever with his New Deal, which ushered in an age of entitlement.
The mentality gained steam with Lyndon B. Johnsons Great Society, and took an even greater hold with the election of Barack Obama, whose Democratic Party rode his coattails to victory in the midst of an economic crisis.
Under Obamas leadership, big government has flexed its muscle to take control of the health care delivery system, Wall Street, the auto industry, and investment bankingleading to more bureaucracy, more control, and more taxes.
Even with all thats been accomplished, theres still a final step we must take to ensure that we achieve enlightenment: We must institute Freefare, which would eliminate hunger, suffering, and racial disparities.
By examining the progressive reforms initiated by FDR, Johnson, Obama and others who subdued the masses by developing meaningful wealth redistribution systems, well be able to embrace the next logical step toward a totally class neutral society; Freefare" />
