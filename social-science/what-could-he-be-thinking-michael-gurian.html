  <title>What Could He Be Thinking? - Michael Gurian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Having studied how boys and girls develop differently, Michael Gurian turns his attention to adult men in this entertaining, informative, and groundbreaking book on the male brain. Following two decades of neurobiological research, &lt;i&gt;What Could He Be Thinking?&lt;/i&gt; answers the questions women and the world are asking about husbands, fathers, boyfriends, and coworkers. Mixing neurobiology with Gurian&#39;s very readable writing style, anecdotes from everyday life, and a new vision of the male psyche, the book will satisfy the tremendous curiosity women and our culture have about the roots of male behavior. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Women know intuitively that men are different from them. What women are now just coming to realize is that the men they are married to, having sex with, working with, parenting with, and trying to fathom, act and think in very male ways, not only because they are socialized to do so, but because they are built to - neurobiologically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new field of brain science has revealed wonderful secrets about a man&#39;s mind. In this book, women who are eager to understand the men in their lives can discover the new brain science in an entertaining way, as they get answers to the prime question every woman asks at some time in her life: What could he be thinking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book provides fascinating information about the male brain, male habits, male tendencies and the nuances of men&#39;s&#39; actions and thoughts. It is a provocative, exciting vision into the minds of men.&lt;/p&gt;" />
