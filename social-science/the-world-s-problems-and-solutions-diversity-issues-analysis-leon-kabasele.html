  <title>The World’S Problems and Solutions: Diversity Issues Analysis - Leon Kabasele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My sixth book, The Worlds Problems and Solutions, discusses many issues concerning the world, and from these debates, analysis, and development, many people in the world will find the solution to most of the problems in their countries. There is not only one problem, such as the world financial crisis  there are many crises that affect the world. From my research, I believe that there is also war on religion that affects the world, and the governments have a duty to serve the population rather the population serving the governments. I discover there is even a problem about the human race as a whole: scientist experiments do not provide exact information because they are still discovering more information about the human race. Many people have their own philosophical methods to find the solutions in their continent and also in their countries. Therefore my research and analysis seeks to expose the solution to many problems in the world. The politicians, governments, religions, and others world institutions will find this book very interesting for humanitys development." />
