  <title>Topics on Economics and Social Science - Barrington K. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This manuscript consists of 16 research papers that were completed between the years 1982 and 2005, the analyses of which range from the purely theoretical, to the empirical, and extending to the more ideological and philosophical. In any case, the emphasis of each paper is upon creativity,
with inventiveness and innovation being the essential elements.
&lt;p&gt;Part two of this manuscript consists of a purely theoretical paper. This
paper presents a fresh approach to macroeconomic theory and policy.
&lt;p&gt;Part Three, consisting of empirically oriented projects, employs unique
variable and model specifications in order to verify existing theories in
economics. The first three papers, in this part, verifies the theories of
bilateral monopoly and the employment effects of minimum wage legislation
under conditions of competition, monopsony, and monopoly. The next
paper examines Caribbean economic integration and verifies the principle
of comparative advantage. The fifth paper, in this part, examines the
relationship between market structure and rates of return. The sixth paper,
in this part, deals with the gaming industry.
&lt;p&gt;The fourth part of this manuscript deals with the more ideological
and philosophical aspects of economics and social science. The first
two papers, in this part, tend to emphasize laissez faire capitalism. The
third, and last, paper of this part, begins to break with this tendency,
and, thus, serves as somewhat of an introduction to the fifth part of this
manuscript.
&lt;p&gt;The fifth part of this manuscript is much more interdisciplinary in
nature compared to the earlier parts and deals with class conflict and extends
to conflict in general. The first paper presents the primary class conflict
model and five additional papers follow. The fifth paper, while an empirical
undertaking, is included here because it is consistent with the general topic
of this part of the manuscript." />
