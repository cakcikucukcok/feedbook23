  <title>Through the Dark Looking Glass - Garret Godwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ira Ellingswortha pawn in the neoconservative movement under the tutelage of his boss, Fred Rollins, a born-again evangelical Christian and archconservativerealizes that this is not the destiny he wanted for himself. As an assistant district attorney, he comes face-to-face with the unholy trinity of the Patriot Act, the Military Commissions Act of 2006, and the Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Act of 2007. To make matters worse, he is proselytized to become a member of the Christian Zionist movement, which he eventually finds to be hypocritical. He and his comrade-in-arms Carol Langley do battle against these forces, but they realize that they are outmatched. Seeking a new direction, Ira and Carol get hired by Roberto Sanchez, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and they blossom as civil rights lawyers. Ira now fights against everything that Fred Rollins stands for, and he starts to bring justice back from near annihilation. The national intelligence agencies and their ever-expanding surveillance powers receive their first reality check compliments of the ACLU, and Ira becomes an unlikely hero. He then undergoes a spiritual transformation as he breaks free from the power-obsessed neoconservative world and sees that the country is finally moving in a new direction." />
