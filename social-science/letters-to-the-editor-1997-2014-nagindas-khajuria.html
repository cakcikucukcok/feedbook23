  <title>Letters to the Editor (1997-2014) - Nagindas Khajuria</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have known Nagindas for more than 32 years.  When I first met him in the early 1980s I was a newly qualified accountant, and Nagindas had already been in practice for more than 15 years.  At the time he had just returned from a stint of work in the Middle East, and since I was contemplating going to the Middle East for work also, he was a source of much advice and guidance, and indeed, he was a kind of role model to mehe inspired me to achieve his level of attainment.
Since I returned to the UK in the early 2000s, Nagindas has acted as my accountant (as I have moved away from the world of accounting and auditing).  The last 15 years has been the time when I have come to know Nagindas at a much closer, professional and personal, level.  Professionally, I would say that he is a competent and thorough accountant with integrity and always has the best interests of his clients at heart.  I have found that he does not panic in crisis situationshis approach to crisis management is to always act in a cool and calm manner.  On any particular aspect involving accounting, auditing or taxation matter, he first develops deep understanding of the subject matterhe does not comment until he has all the factsand when he does, he goes to the crux of the matterthis is reflected in one of the companies he has set up
At a personal levelNagindas is approachable and jovialand humorous at timesmany a times I can think of examples where his particular take on a matter was accompanied by humorous anecdotes which made a lot of sense and captured the essence of the subject or idea being discussed.  I personally think this is reflected in some of the &#39;Letters to the Editor&#39; that he has written to newspapers over the last decade and a half.
