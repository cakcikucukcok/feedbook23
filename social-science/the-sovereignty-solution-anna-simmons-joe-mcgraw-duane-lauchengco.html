  <title>The Sovereignty Solution - Anna  Simmons, Joe McGraw, Duane Lauchengco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Sovereignty Solution&lt;/I&gt; is not an Establishment national security strategy.  Instead, it describes what the U.S. could actually do to restore order to the world without having to engage in either global policing or nation-building. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Currently there is no coherent plan that addresses questions like: If terrorists were to strike Chicago tomorrow, what would we do?  When Chicago is burning, whom would we target?  How would we respond?  There is nothing in place and no strategy on the horizon to either reassure the American public or warn the world: attack us, and this is what you can expect.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this book, a Naval Postgraduate School professor and her Special Forces coauthors offer a radical yet commonsensical approach to recalibrating global security. Their book discusses what the United States could actually do to restore order to the world without having to engage in either global policing or nation-building. Two tracks to their strategy are presented: strengthening state responsibility abroad and strengthening the social fabric at home. The authors&amp;#8217; goal is to provoke a serious debate that addresses the gaps and disconnects between what the United States says and what it does, how it wants to be perceived, and how it is perceived. Without leaning left or right, they hope to draw many people into the debate and force Washington to rethink what it sends service men and women abroad to do.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
