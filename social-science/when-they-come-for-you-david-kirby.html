  <title>When They Come for You - David Kirby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A revealing book about how government, law enforcement, and bureaucratic interests are seizing our property, our children, our savings, and our fundamental American rights--and how to fight back. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Liberty and justice for all is the bedrock of American democracy, but has America betrayed our founders&#39; vision for the nation? In &lt;i&gt;When They Come For You&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author David Kirby exposes federal, state, and local violations of basic constitutional rights that should trouble every American, whether liberal, conservative, or libertarian. Free speech, privacy, protection from unreasonable search and seizure, due process, and equal protection under the law are rights that belong to every American citizen, but are being shredded at an alarming rate all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police and prosecutorial misconduct, overzealous bureaucrats with virtually unchecked power, unwarranted searches, SWAT-style raids on the homes of innocent Americans, crackdowns on a free press and the right to protest, removing children from their parents without cause, &quot;debtors prisons,&quot; restricting freedom of health choice, seizing private assets for government profit, and much more demonstrate how deeply our rights and our national values are eroding. &lt;i&gt;When They Come For You &lt;/i&gt;uses true stories of everyday citizens to reveal how our federal, state, and municipal governments, police, lawmakers, judges, revenue agents, unelected power brokers, and even government social workers are eviscerating our most fundamental liberties. And, it shows how people are fighting back--and winning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
