  <title>America, But Better: The Canada Party Manifesto - Chris Cannon, Brian Calvert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;As the American election increasingly resembles a production of CATS performed by actual cats, U.S. citizens are looking for a new leader. That leader is Canada, and they want your vote for president of the United States.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Since launching their viral video campaign in January, the Canada Party has been covered around the world, including CNN, BBC, the Huffington Post, and German State Television. America, but Better: the Canada Party Manifesto, balances the doctrine of American exceptionalism with a dose of Canadian humility and common sense to secure Canada as the new leader of the free world, by proxy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Their promises: One gay couple will be allowed to marry for every straight couple that gets divorced. The phrase &quot;job creators&quot; will be changed to &quot;job creationists,&quot; and they will be given seven days to actually create some.&lt;BR&gt;Corporations will still be people, but if they can&#39;t provide a birth certificate they will be legally obligated to care for your lawn. Corners will be installed in the Oval Office, and timeouts given to congressmen who can&#39;t play nice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Devoted to restoring America to its former glory, the Canada Party will soon have the whole world chanting, &quot;Yes We Canada.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />
