  <title>A grand strategy for America - Robert J. Art</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The United States today is the most powerful nation in the world, perhaps even stronger than Rome was during its heyday. It is likely to remain the world&#39;s preeminent power for at least several decades to come. What behavior is appropriate for such a powerful state? To answer this question, Robert J. Art concentrates on &quot;grand strategy&quot;-the deployment of military power in both peace and war to support foreign policy goals.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;He first defines America&#39;s contemporary national interests and the specific threats they face, then identifies seven grand strategies that the United States might contemplate, examining each in relation to America&#39;s interests. The seven are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;•dominion-forcibly trying to remake the world in America&#39;s own image;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;• global collective security-attempting to keep the peace everywhere;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;•regional collective security-confining peacekeeping efforts to Europe;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;• cooperative security-seeking to reduce the occurrence of war by limiting other states&#39; offensive capabilities;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;• isolationism-withdrawing from all military involvement beyond U.S. borders;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;•containment-holding the line against aggressor states; and&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;•selective engagement-choosing to prevent or to become involved only in those conflicts that pose a threat to the country&#39;s long-term interests.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Art makes a strong case for selective engagement as the most desirable strategy for contemporary America. It is the one that seeks to forestall dangers, not simply react to them; that is politically viable, at home and abroad; and that protects all U.S. interests, both essential and desirable. Art concludes that &quot;selective engagement is not a strategy for all times, but it is the best grand strategy for these times.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
