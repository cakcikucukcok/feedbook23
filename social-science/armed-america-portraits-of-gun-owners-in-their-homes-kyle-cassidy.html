  <title>Armed America: Portraits of Gun Owners in Their Homes - Kyle Cassidy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the 2004 Presidential Election was beginning to take shape, Kyle Cassidy took note of the important role the simple concept of gun ownership was playing. Hardly anyone he knew didn&#39;t have an opinion in the debate over owning guns. Why was a constitutionally protected right so heavily debated, and who exactly as these folks that own guns? &quot;I began to wonder who these seventy or so million Americans were, how they lived and what was important to them. I set out to photographs as many gun owners as I could and ask them one question: &quot;Why do you own a gun.&quot;&quot;&lt;p&gt;    Cassidy traveled over 20,000 miles, crisscrossing the country to meet with gun owners in their homes. Cassidy&#39;s photo essays create a powerful, thought provoking and sometimes startling view of gun ownership in the U.S. These &quot;everyman&quot; portraits, and the accompanying views of gun owners, fashion a riveting and provocative hardcover book." />
