  <title>Heads in the Sand: How the Republicans Screw Up Foreign Policy and Foreign Policy Screws Up the Democrats - Matthew Yglesias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A very serious, thoughtful argument that has never been made in such detail or with such care.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;-Ezra Klein, staff writer at The American Prospect&lt;P&gt;&quot;Matt Yglesias is one of the smartest voices in the blogosphere. He knows a lot about politics, a lot about foreign policy, and, crucially, is unusually shrewd in understanding how they interact. Here&#39;s hoping that his new book will introduce him to an even wider audience. Once you discover him, you&#39;ll be hooked.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;-E. J. Dionne, author of Souled Out: Reclaiming Faith and Politics After the Religious Right and Why Americans Hate Politics&lt;P&gt;&quot;Matthew Yglesias is one of a handful of bloggers that I make a point of reading every day. Heads in the Sand is a smart, vital book that urges Democrats to stop evading the foreign-policy debate and to embrace the old principles of international liberalism--to be right and also to win.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;-Fred Kaplan, author of Daydream Believers: How a Few Grand Ideas Wrecked American Power&lt;P&gt;&quot;Reading foreign policy tomes is seldom included among life&#39;s pleasures, but Yglesias has concocted a startling exception. Heads in the Sand is not just a razor-sharp analysis cum narrative of the politics of national security in general and the Iraq war in particular, it&#39;s also an enthralling and often very funny piece of writing. Though he administers strong antidotes to the haplessness of his fellow Democrats and liberals, there&#39;s more than a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;-Hendrik Hertzberg, Senior Editor, The New Yorker, and author of Politics: Observations and Arguments&lt;P&gt;Fast-rising political commentator Matthew Yglesias reveals the wrong-headed foreign policy stance of conservatives, neocons, and the Republican Party for what it is-aggressive nationalism. Writing with wit, passion, and keen insight, Yglesias reminds us of the rich tradition of liberal internationalism that, developed by Democrats, was used with great success by both Democratic and Republican administrations for more than fifty years. He provides a starting point for politicians, policymakers, pundits, and citizens alike to return America to its role as leader of a peace-loving and cooperative international community." />
