  <title>All Our Relations - Tanya Talaga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this vital and incisive work, bestselling and award-winning author Tanya Talaga explores the alarming rise of youth suicide in Indigenous communities in Canada and beyond. From Northern Ontario to Nunavut, Norway, Brazil, Australia, and the United States, the Indigenous experience in colonized nations is startlingly similar and deeply disturbing. It is an experience marked by the violent separation of Peoples from the land, the separation of families, and the separation of individuals from traditional ways of life &amp;#8212; all of which has culminated in a spiritual separation that has had an enduring impact on generations of Indigenous children. As a result of this colonial legacy, too many communities today lack access to the basic determinants of health &amp;#8212; income, employment, education, a safe environment, health services &amp;#8212; leading to a mental health and youth suicide crisis on a global scale. But, Talaga reminds us, First Peoples also share a history of resistance, resilience, and civil rights activism, from the Occupation of Alcatraz led by the Indians of All Tribes, to the Northern Ontario Stirland Lake Quiet Riot, to the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, which united Indigenous Nations from across Turtle Island in solidarity.&lt;/p&gt; 
        &lt;p&gt;Based on her Atkinson Fellowship in Public Policy series, &lt;em&gt;All Our Relations&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful call for action, justice, and a better, more equitable world for all Indigenous Peoples.&lt;/p&gt;" />
