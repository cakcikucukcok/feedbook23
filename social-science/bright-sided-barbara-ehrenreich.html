  <title>Bright-sided - Barbara Ehrenreich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Barbara Ehrenreich&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Bright-sided&lt;/i&gt; is a sharp-witted knockdown of America&#39;s love affair with positive thinking and an urgent call for a new commitment to realism&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans are a &quot;positive&quot; people--cheerful, optimistic, and upbeat: this is our reputation as well as our self-image. But more than a temperament, being positive, we are told, is the key to success and prosperity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this utterly original take on the American frame of mind, Barbara Ehrenreich traces the strange career of our sunny outlook from its origins as a marginal nineteenth-century healing technique to its enshrinement as a dominant, almost mandatory, cultural attitude. Evangelical mega-churches preach the good news that you only have to want something to get it, because God wants to &quot;prosper&quot; you. The medical profession prescribes positive thinking for its presumed health benefits. Academia has made room for new departments of &quot;positive psychology&quot; and the &quot;science of happiness.&quot; Nowhere, though, has bright-siding taken firmer root than within the business community, where, as Ehrenreich shows, the refusal even to consider negative outcomes--like mortgage defaults--contributed directly to the current economic crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the mythbusting powers for which she is acclaimed, Ehrenreich exposes the downside of America&#39;s penchant for positive thinking: On a personal level, it leads to self-blame and a morbid preoccupation with stamping out &quot;negative&quot; thoughts. On a national level, it&#39;s brought us an era of irrational optimism resulting in disaster. This is Ehrenreich at her provocative best--poking holes in conventional wisdom and faux science, and ending with a call for existential clarity and courage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
