  <title>The Accused - Richard J. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Richard Lewis had been a youth therapist, foster carer and teacher in a large city comprehensive school for over 20 years, but his personal integrity was suddenly brought into question by the claims of a former student 16 years ago. His dedicated life as a supporter of delinquent and wayward teenagers was brought to a sudden halt, where, at one point, suicide appeared to be the best way out. The Accused is a harrowing autobiography of an innocent man, a personal ordeal where it was felt that the system presumes one is guilty till proven innocent.
When a child abuse allegation is made, where two people stand by irreconcilable testimonies, a strategy group of professionals has to make a decision that has serious long-term consequences. The Accused presents the voice of a victim subjected to an uncorroborated disclosure.
This book argues for a review of current child protection procedures, for an examination of stereotypical beliefs and assumptions centring of an enquiry, and for the case to examine the social implications of making unfounded allegations of abuse against professional personnel." />
