  <title>Feminist Perspectives on Social Work Practice - Shannon Butler-Mokoro, Laurie Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Feminist Perspectives on Social Work Practice &lt;/em&gt;is a contemporary look at the issues across a wide spectrum, beyond just equal pay for equal work and reproductive rights, with which women struggle on a daily basis. The Trump administration&#39;s call to roll back the progress that women have made over the decades in terms of social welfare benefits, reproductive rights, and employment recognition, alongside the continuing victimization of women who have survived sexual violence, are just a few examples demonstrating why social workers and other human service professionals need to continue to advocate and care for women in particular ways.
This book aims to continue keeping the lives of women and the issues that affect and matter most to them at the forefront of the discussions about society and social services. The text will help readers to gain an understanding of populations of women that they might/will work with in the field of human services. Using demographics, case studies, and best practice/evidence-based programs, the authors collectively provide students and practitioners with a comprehensive knowledge of women from a feminist perspective." />
