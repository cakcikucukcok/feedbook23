  <title>Enough Said - Mark Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s a crisis of trust in politics across the western world. Public anger is rising and faith in conventional political leaders and parties is falling. Anti-politics, and the anti-politicians, have arrived. In &lt;i&gt;Enough Said,&lt;/i&gt; President and CEO of The New York Times Company Mark Thompson argues that one of the most significant causes of the crisis is the way our public language has changed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Enough Said&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of how we got from the language of FDR and Churchill to that of Donald Trump. It forensically examines the public language we&#39;ve been left with: compressed, immediate, sometimes brilliantly impactful, but robbed of most of its explanatory power. It studies the rhetoric of western leaders from Reagan and Thatcher to Berlesconi, Blair, and today&#39;s political elites on both sides of the Atlantic. And it charts how a changing public language has interacted with real world events - Iraq, the financial crash, the UK&#39;s surprising Brexit from the EU, immigration - and led to a mutual breakdown of trust between politicians and journalists, to leave ordinary citizens suspicious, bitter, and increasingly unwilling to believe anybody. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing from classical as well as contemporary examples and ranging across politics, business, science, technology, and the arts, &lt;i&gt;Enough Said&lt;/i&gt; is a smart and shrewd look at the erosion of language by an author uniquely placed to measure its consequences.&lt;/p&gt;" />
