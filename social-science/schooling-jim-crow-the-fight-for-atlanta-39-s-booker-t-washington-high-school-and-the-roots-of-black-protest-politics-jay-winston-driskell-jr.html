  <title>Schooling Jim Crow: The Fight for Atlanta&#39;s Booker T. Washington High School and the Roots of Black Protest     Politics - Jay Winston Driskell Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1919 the NAACP organized a voting bloc powerful enough to compel the     city of Atlanta to budget $1.5 million for the construction of schools for black students.     This victory would have been remarkable in any era, but in the context of the Jim Crow South it     was revolutionary. &lt;i&gt;Schooling Jim Crow&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of this little-known     campaign, which happened less than thirteen years after the Atlanta race riot of 1906 and just     weeks before a wave of anti-black violence swept the nation in the summer after the end of World     War I. Despite the constant threat of violence, Atlanta&#39;s black voters were able to force     the city to build five black grammar schools and Booker T. Washington High School, the     city&#39;s first publicly funded black high school. &lt;i&gt;Schooling Jim Crow&lt;/i&gt;     reveals how they did it and why it matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this pathbreaking book, Jay     Driskell explores the changes in black political consciousness that made the NAACP&#39;s     grassroots campaign possible at a time when most black southerners could not vote, let alone     demand schools. He reveals how black Atlantans transformed a reactionary politics of     respectability into a militant force for change. Contributing to this militancy were     understandings of class and gender transformed by decades of racially segregated urban     development, the 1906 Atlanta race riot, Georgia&#39;s disfranchisement campaign of 1908, and     the upheavals of World War I. On this cultural foundation, black Atlantans built a new urban     black politics that would become the model for the NAACP&#39;s political strategy well into     the twentieth century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
