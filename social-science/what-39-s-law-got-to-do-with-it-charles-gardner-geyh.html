  <title>What&#39;s Law Got to Do With It? - Charles Gardner Geyh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In &lt;I&gt;What&#39;s Law Got to Do With It?&lt;/I&gt;, the nation&#39;s top legal scholars and political scientists examine to what extent the law actually shapes how judges behave and make decisions, and what it means for society at large. 
Although there is a growing consensus among legal scholars and political scientists, significant points of divergence remain. Contributors to this book explore ways to reach greater accord on the complexity and nuance of judicial decisionmaking and judicial elections, while acknowledging that agreement on what judges do is not likely to occur any time soon. 
As the first forum in which political scientists and legal scholars engage with one another on these hot button issues, this volume strives to establish a true interdisciplinary conversation. The inclusion of reactions from practicing judges puts into high relief the deep-seated and opposing beliefs about the roles of law and politics in judicial work." />
