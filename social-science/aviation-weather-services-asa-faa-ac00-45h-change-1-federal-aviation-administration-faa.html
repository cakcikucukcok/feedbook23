  <title>Aviation Weather Services: ASA FAA-AC00-45H, Change 1 - Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Published the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), with the participation of the National Weather Service, this FAA Advisory Circular (AC) 00-45H explains the U.S. aviation weather products and services available to pilots. With full-color illustrations throughout, it details the interpretation and application of advisories, coded weather reports, forecasts, observed and prognostic weather charts, and radar and satellite imagery.
Readers will find full coverage of weather-related tools to assist every pilot’s flight planning and in?flight decisions.
