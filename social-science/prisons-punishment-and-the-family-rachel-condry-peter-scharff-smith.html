  <title>Prisons, Punishment, and the Family - Rachel Condry, Peter Scharff Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every year millions of families are affected by the imprisonment of a family member. Children of imprisoned parents alone can be counted in millions in the USA and in Europe. It is a bewildering fact that while we have had prisons for centuries, and the deprivation of liberty has been a central pillar in the Western mode of punishment since the early nineteenth century, we have only relatively recently embarked upon a serious discussion of the severe effects of
imprisonment for the families and relatives of offenders and the implications this has for society.
This book draws together some of the excellent research that addresses the impact of criminal justice and incarceration in particular upon the families of offenders. It assembles examples of recent and ongoing studies from eight different countries in order to not only learn about the secondary effects and &#39;collateral consequences&#39; of imprisonment but also to understand what the experiences and lived realities of prisoners&#39; families means for the sociology of punishment and our broader
understanding of criminal justice systems. While punishment and society scholarship has gained significant ground in recent years it has often remained silent on the ways in which the families of prisoners are affected by our practices of punishment. This book provides evidence of the importance of including
families within this scholarship and explores themes of legitimacy, citizenship, human rights, marginalization, exclusion, and inequality." />
