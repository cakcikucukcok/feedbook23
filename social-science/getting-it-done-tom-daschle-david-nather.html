  <title>Getting It Done - Tom Daschle, David Nather</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Senator Tom Daschle&#39;s narrative of what went on behind the scenes in the making of the new health care legislation delivers a powerful lesson in the workings of American politics.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evolution of health care reform was drawn-out, frustrating, and complicated, but Senator Tom Daschle is the ideal person to recount the process.  His account will guide you through the entire story, from the earliest presidential campaign debates -- and his firsthand experiences in the Obama team -- through the battles on Capitol Hill to solve our most serious health care problems.  Not simply a book about policy, Daschle&#39;s narrative describes in vivid detail how fragile the support in Congress was at every step of the way, as well as the frantic efforts to design a rescue strategy before time ran out.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining his insights as a health care expert and his political expertise, this is the inside story about how the new legislation came together: from the persistence of President Obama to the subsequent efforts--and counter efforts--within the Senate and the House.  In Daschle&#39;s hands, this becomes a dramatic personal story and a remarkable lesson in politics at the highest level.&lt;/p&gt;" />
