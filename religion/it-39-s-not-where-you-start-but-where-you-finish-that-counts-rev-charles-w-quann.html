  <title>It&#39;s Not Where You Start, but Where You Finish That Counts - Rev. Charles W. Quann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about the power of God. God can intercede in any life, and turn it all the way around, regardless of the situation. The power of God that is working in our world today is sometimes overlooked because of all of the poverty, dysfunctional families, and violence we see every day. Yet, we know God moves with a hand of mercy and a heart of love, and brings about miraculous changes in the lives of His people.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Faith in God is one of the major factors of this book, such as the ability to rise above ones circumstances and achieve God given goals to break the strongholds of life that have enslaved so many; to really believe that God has the power to work things out according to His way and to His will, and that all things work together to the glory of God to those who put their faith and trust in Him; to gain a deeper knowledge of God as a result of the need to depend upon Him; and to never to give up but to keep on reaching and pressing on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I invite you to visit the Bethlehem Baptist Church website, www.bbc4christ.org, to read Pastors Daily Devotions which is distributed quarterly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
