  <title>Gravel and Grit - Rosemary Coplin Dahlberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rosemary is a spunky, outspoken little girl growing up in Kansas. She and her family dont have a lot of material things, but that doesnt mean Rosemary is missing out on life. She has much to enjoy on the family farm, including her dogs and the assorted farm animals she takes under her wing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gravel and Grit, author Rosemary Coplin Dahlberg takes us back to the Kansas farm where she grew up in the 1930s and 1940s. These were the days of radios instead of television sets, games that required imagination instead of joysticks, and party lines instead of cell phones. Homes often had the unique smell of Lava soap and Spic and Span cleanliness instead of potpourri.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dahlberg shares her memories of how she met lifes issues head on. Life lessons involving her beloved dogs, her classmates, and her neighbors are experienced and lessons learned, sometimes the hard way. World War II, a tornado, and family loss all bring changes to Rosemary and her family. But through it all, God is always present, giving Rosemary faith and a moral compass for her future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
