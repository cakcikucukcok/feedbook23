  <title>When God Speaks - Kynaston M. Ramsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all use numbers every day to bring precision into our communications, whether it be reminding others of our birthday, negotiating our salary, keeping track of our weight, or determining the price of a product. Even more so in scripture, God, who created numbers, uses them to bring His Word in the human language into sharper focus, and to communicate His will, His Word, and His Way.
God created the numerical mode of communication. It gives us additional understanding of His nature and character. It also provides an avenue of learning which renders a more precise interpretation of the role and responsibility of each person of the Godhead, of course, limited by our frailties.
In addition, it helps us to focus on the issues in the conflict between good and evil, why God created us, and the role we play in the great design. Notwithstanding, it also delivers an important sign as to the end of time.
* * * *
Coming soon is the book WHEN GOD SPEAKS  THE APOCALYPTIC INTERLUDE. This book is intended to give insight into some of the numerical dynamics of Scripture and pointing toward the second coming of Jesus. As we recognize the numerical patterns, we will appreciate the added dimension they give to Bible study by highlighting and underlining important teachings." />
