  <title>A Gps for Marriage and Family - John P. Therrien Ma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is much afoot these days that can and does lead to a number of side roads and dead ends, constituting a barrier, deterring couples and families from reaching their desired destination. Currently, while not well marked or hidden, for many they have become main highways, leading to a dead end of frustration at best or disillusionment at worst.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Marriage and family life are all about relationships. The question is, will the relationship dynamics in the family guide them to their destination or to a dead end? Our universal human desire is to be fulfilled in our life experience. And what better way than in the interactive relationships that can be experienced in an uplifting family adventure?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There are certain effective ways beyond good communication skills for couples to interact with each other and their children. Since we are all human, the ideas expressed will bring challenges, yet the rewards are what we are all looking for in our livesjoy and that elusive state called fulfillment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book reveals the roads they took in order to reach that destination as a family with a peek at what many people hope will work but doesnt.&lt;/p&gt;" />
