  <title>Grace Revolution? or the Man of Lawlessness Revealed? - Robert B. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The grace revolution is a rebellion against God, opening the Christian world to accepting a man of lawlessness and to fighting Jesus at His coming. Televangelists have convinced a majority of the Christian world to tell God that His definition of grace is all wrong, that grace means His law of love is done away. They are calling the Father and Jesus liars and telling God they know better, saying we can believe Pauls words, but not Jesus words. As this most important book by a pastor and author who faced the false grace heresy a half-century ago and has studied it thoroughly over the years appears, the anti-law, end-time falling away has begun, becoming the norm for the Christian world. Few understand the danger: it opens the door for the appearance of the man of lawlessness whom Jesus will destroy at His coming. You can be one of the few who escape this great last days falling away. This book is the first to lay bare the weakness of all the arguments of this end-time apostasy. It reveals the true biblical grace, principally the empowerment to keep Gods law of love as well as opening the door to reap its abundant blessings. You dont have to fall for this heresy, condemned by Jesus (Mat. 5:17-20).&lt;/p&gt;" />
