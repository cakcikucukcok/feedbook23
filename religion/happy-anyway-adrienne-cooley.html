  <title>Happy ANYWAY - Adrienne Cooley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Happy ANYWAY is like that favorite pair of shoes you can wear with anything. It is a 6 week devotional, an &amp;quot;all about me&amp;quot; workbook of sorts, a small group curriculum, a fun book to read, and a cute little happy for a friend. This study is sure to help you find your happy, understand the true source of it, and form habits to spread the happy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My hope is that you will use the tools provided in these fun, color-filled pages to help you discover joy and enjoy it. You will be encouraged by the stories of those who have found their joy by using the HAPPY process each day to study scriptures. Before long, you will find yourself worrying less and being happy more, having a happy perspective rather than a gloomy one. You will see more clearly just how your emotional, physical, and spiritual life affects joy, depression, love, happiness, health, relationships, mental health, discipline, habits, peace, anxiety, and hope.&amp;nbsp; The truths between these covers have revolutionized my life and I just know they will yours, too, if you let them. So why don&amp;rsquo;t you grab a friend and a cup of coffee or tea and join me in learning how to become happy ANYWAY?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
