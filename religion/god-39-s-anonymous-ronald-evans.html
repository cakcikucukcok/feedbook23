  <title>God&#39;s Anonymous - Ronald Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book about the truth of my life from my point of view. Many
times in my life people have told their side of the story to make themselves
look good and me the bad guy but, I will tell you the raw truth as the Lord
has instructed me to do. At this time in my life I will not hold back and I am
going to be as transparent as I can no matter how much it hurts me. This is
the true meaning of the word testify. I feel compelled to write this book under
inspiration from my father God which is in heaven and I hope that someone
gets touched, saved and healed even delivered from reading my life story.
Pastor Ronnie Evans began his relationship with the Lord in 1976 at King of Kings Full Gospel Tabernacle under the leadership of Bishop Isaiah McKinnon. He graduated from Hackensack High School and attended Fairleigh Dickerson University Teaneck, NJ and Morris County College in Morristown NJ. After being called to preach at age 18, he attended East Texas Bible College founded by R.W. Schambach for 2 years. After attending Bible College, Pastor Ronnie started doing the work of an evangelist by conducting numerous street meetings in towns such as Hackensack, Paterson and East Orange. In these street meetings the hand of God moved mightily with countless healings, deliverances and salvation. He held his first tent meeting in Paterson, NJ during 1999. In the early 2000s, Pastor Ronnie attended Bethel Total Man Ministries located at 202 James St. Hackensack, NJ where they ordained him as a Pastor.
Pastor Ronnie has one sister, Patricia Evans &amp; two brothers, Peter (died years ago) and Gregory Evans. His mother who recently went home to be with the Lord (November, 2012) was a strong influence in his life. Pastor Ronnie was blessed with two fathers, Rodney Marshal and step-father, Reedy Evans (both deceased).
After a period of separation from the Lord, his heavenly father (turning his back on God twice); the God of the first, second and third chances has resurrected Pastor Ronnie and empowered him with a new anointing, power through the Holy Ghost and revelation in the Word for this generation." />
