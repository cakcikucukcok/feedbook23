  <title>Touching the Edge: A Mother&#39;s Spiritual Journey from Loss to Life - Margaret Wurtele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praise for Touching the Edge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Touching the Edge is an homage to love, loss, and the rising grace that comes when grief is transformed into peace. Margaret Wurtele&#39;s bow to her son, Phil, is a story we can all recognize within the context of each family&#39;s dance with death. Her words can heal the fall of a human heart.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Terry Tempest Williams, author of Refuge, Red, and Leap&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Touching the Edge is an extraordinary memoir. Margaret Wurtele writes of the most painful events a parent can ever imagine, and yet she writes so honestly, so clearly, with prose as lucid and shimmering as cut crystal, that the book shines with a quiet grace. I too have a single grown child. I read this book and trembled. But I also saw, through Margaret Wurtele&#39;s eyes, a glimpse of the light that guided her through the darkness. It was a privilege to read this book.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Susan Allen Toth, author of Blooming: A Small-Town Girlhood and My Love Affair with England&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I happened to be climbing on Rainier the day that Phil was killed, and I often wondered who he was, what he was like. Now, thanks to this beautifully told account, I have a very good idea. And I have an even clearer sense of what it means to be a parent, and a child of God. This book will choke you up, but the tears will be more than worth it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Bill McKibben, author of The End of Nature and Long Distance: Testing the Limits of Body and Spirit in a Year of Living Strenuously&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The experience of love and loss, when shared, can become the alchemy of a rebirth of the spirit in others. In this journey to the other side of grief, Margaret Wurtele is fearlessly true to her experience of loss and makes herself available to be an agent of transformation for her readers. This is the glory of the human story: we really are &#39;members of one another&#39; whether we realize it or not.&quot;&lt;br&gt;-Alan Jones, Dean of Grace Cathedral, San Francisco, and author of Seasons of Grace, The Soul&#39;s Journey, and Living the Truth" />
