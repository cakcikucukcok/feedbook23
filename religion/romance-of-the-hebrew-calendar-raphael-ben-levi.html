  <title>Romance of the Hebrew Calendar - Raphael Ben Levi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the introduction to &#39;Romance of the Hebrew Calendar,&#39; author Raphael Ben Levi writes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This book is about relationships, I make no apologies for it. When everything has been said and done, what are we left with that endures? Relationships, borne out of agape love. This is what the deepest and most authentic relationships are composed of from beginning to end.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This absorbing and ground breaking book will inspire readers to develop a deeper relationship with God, and bring restoration to those who are spiritually broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the author, there is a special heartbeat that pulsates through the veins of the biblical year which has helped shape the identity of the Jewish people. Written from a Jewish messianic perspective, &#39;Romance of the Hebrew Calendar&#39; contains inspirational and fresh insights that are highly engaging and provocative. The main theme is complemented by a rich compendium of poignant stories and devotions drawn from Jewish tradition, historical archives and firsthand accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish festivals are lovingly presented to demonstrate a unified message of redemption. The months of the Hebrew calendar are accompanied by individual sections relating to the constellation connected to each tribe as represented by their banner or flag. The Hebrew word &#39;mazal,&#39; from the plural word &#39;mazzaroth&#39; is associated with the patterns of stars in the sky, and we find various biblical references to it such as in the Book of Job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, &#39;Romance of the Hebrew Calendar,&#39; contains individual sections for each chapter relating to the jewels of the high priest&#39;s ephod, their colours and their inherent connection with the twelve tribes of Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined messages contained within the biblical feasts, the mazzaroth and the jewels of the high priest&#39;s ephod, converge to form a unified declaration of God&#39;s love, revealed in Yeshua Ha Meshiach that will capture your imagination and attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is beautifully written, easy to read and contains many insights and revelations that are interwoven and presented to make it a treasure to adorn every bookshelf.&lt;/p&gt;" />
