  <title>The Joy of You - William E. Rabior</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Hope is on the horizon, and it&#39;s time to take back your life. More than two million couples divorce each year, and the experience can be devastating--creating a sense of loss, loneliness, mistrust, and failure. The effects of divorce are often felt heaviest by Catholics.
&lt;P&gt;But there is life after divorce. As a counselor with a long history of helping those who have suffered the trauma of divorce, author William Rabior identifies eight key factors to experience healing from divorce culled from the lives of people who have successfully traveled these paths.  From the stories of people who have moved successfully through the process come practical steps in an easy-to-read format for today&#39;s harried lifestyle. Learn to:
&lt;P&gt;1. Work through the grief
&lt;BR&gt;2. Befriend anger
&lt;BR&gt;3. Forgive your former spouse and yourself
&lt;BR&gt;4. Let God help
&lt;BR&gt;5. Talk things out
&lt;BR&gt;6. Give service to others
&lt;BR&gt;7. Find the benefits of laughter
&lt;BR&gt;8. Manage stress 
&lt;P&gt;Refill your life with hopes, dreams, and the realization of a bright future. &lt;I&gt;The Joy of You&lt;/I&gt; explores the path to healing after the devastation of divorce.
