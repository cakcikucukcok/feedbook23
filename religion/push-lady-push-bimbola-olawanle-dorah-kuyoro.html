  <title>Push Lady Push - Bimbola Olawanle, Dorah Kuyoro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Pressing in to protect our family&#39;s hopes, dreams and destinies is the duty of the woman. Such is the driving force behind this book, to awaken women to travail in the place of prayer. PUSH LADY PUSH is borne out of a conviction that diligent passionate prayer yields results. Many of us have neglected these basic principles and have become a prey for Satan, who is the originator of evil forces. PUSH LADY PUSH is inspired by my personal experience and I hope it will bless you. Some of the experiences and ideas shared, if applied will enable you overcome the hills, valleys and every challenge that you may encounter.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Bible says the wise woman builds her home. (Proverbs14:1) There is no better way to build than through the medium of prayer. Insurmountable challenges and struggles will crumble when she prays. There is power in prayer. Mary Queen of Scots once said:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;I fear the prayers of John Knox, more than the armies of France&quot;.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While the content of this book is directed towards ladies, the principles are helpful to any one who is keen to pray .&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The author encourages you to employ and deploy the weapons of prayer. You will discover in this book emphasis on using the word of God as you pray and also included are some prayer points, these are to help those who are learning the art of prayer formulate and present their prayers before God.&lt;/P&gt;" />
