  <title>I Believe in Trinity - Jeffrey M S Vickers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Trinity is not a biblical word, but it is a biblical truth. It describes the essential nature of the Godhead and explains the idea that the fullness of God indwells Yahweh, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. However, rather than limiting his discussion to the horizontal equality between Yahweh, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, which can lead to the erroneous conclusion that Jesus is Yahweh in the flesh and that the Holy Spirit is the risen Christ, the author focuses on the vertical equality demonstrated between Yahweh and God, Jesus and God, and the Holy Spirit and God. This approach will lead serious students of the Bible to the more accurate conclusion that the horizontal equality between Yahweh, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit is not because each is a form of the other two but because the fullness of the Godhead (Colossians 2:9, KJV) dwells vertically and concurrently in each." />
