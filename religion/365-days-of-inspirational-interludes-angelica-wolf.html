  <title>365 Days of Inspirational Interludes - Angelica Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All of us have something to share and learn from one another. Our different backgrounds, races, and beliefs can find common ground even in the smallest of ways. This collection of inspirational quotes is designed to help you find direction on your lifes journey.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelica Wolf started writing poetry and inspirational quotes as a young girl in her native Spanish language. She was born and raised in Mexico and moved to the United States in her early 20s. She previously worked as a freelance writer for two Spanish-language newspapers in GA. As a passionate writer, a few years after learning English, she began to write again. I kept telling myself time after time not to be afraid to put myself out there for constant correction or criticism about my broken English. After two years of writing and editing, she is excited to publish her first book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
