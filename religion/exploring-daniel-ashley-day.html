  <title>Exploring Daniel - Ashley Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=justify&gt;The book of Daniel is one of the most important prophetic texts in the Bible. It sets out, more clearly than any other book, God&#39;s plan for the ages, thus giving us a road map which enables us to understand future worldwide developments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;After the deaths of David and Solomon, the kingdom of Israel split into two parts and rapidly slipped into decline. A succession of godless kings led the people into idolatry and brought them down to humiliation and defeat at the hands of their enemies. By the year 721 BC, the northern ten tribes had disappeared, having been carried off into slavery by the kings of Assyria. The remaining two tribes (Judah and Benjamin) continued for another hundred years but eventually, due to their continued disregard of God&#39;s will, they came to a similar fate.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;Daniel, a young man of high birth, was carried off to Babylon and his book is a graphic account of his incredible experiences there.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=justify&gt;&quot;Exploring Daniel&quot; examines every verse of Daniel&#39;s writing and seeks to explain the meaning and significance of the text. An understanding of the book of Daniel is essential to gaining insight into Bible prophecy in general.&lt;/P&gt;
