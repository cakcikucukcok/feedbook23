  <title>The Wisdom of the Cross - Fr. Anthony C. Mbanefo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Wisdom of the Cross by Fr Anthony C. Mbanefo, MSP, is a refreshing reflection of the power of the Cross. The authors generous use of Sacred Scripture gives a perspective from before and after. Fr Mbanefo stresses the liberation of the Cross and how it is shared in our baptism and in the moment of our redemption. Like his other works, Fr. Mbanefo challenges the reader to use the Cross as a benchmark for our own commitment to discipleship. Ultimately, The Wisdom of the Cross leads to the love that God has for each of us.
+ Most Reverend Gregory J Hartmayer, OFM. Conv. Bishop of Savannah, GA
This book is an invitation for all Christian believers to confront the challenges of life with profound faith and docility to Gods will. Gods love for mankind is made visible in the suffering and death of Christ. Fr Mbanefo demonstrates how the passion and death of Christ makes the day to day sufferings of our human condition full of meaning and purpose. I recommend this book to all those who believing in Christ as their hope want to discover from him, the strength that will aid them in confronting the difficulties of life.
