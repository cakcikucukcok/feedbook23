  <title>The Bible as Improv - Ron Martoia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every Christian desires to follow the Bible. But many of the things the Bible teaches—such as its instructions on how to treat slaves or its direction to sell everything one owns—seem to have little relevance to modern life. Picking and choosing what applies today leaves many readers frustrated and confused.Is it possible that Christians are asking the wrong question of Scripture? Ron Martoia suggests that the narrative sweep of the Bible is lost when it is reduced to quips and maxims. Faithfulness to the text requires faithfulness to its narrative form. Reflecting a high view of Scripture and a profound belief in its power to change lives, Martoia helps readers read the Bible so that its story shapes their own stories. In this new light, readers can move beyond the confusion about what is true today and what is “outdated.”With a passion for seeing people experience revolutionary change in their spiritual lives, Martoia shows readers how to look at the big picture of the Bible. As they will soon find out, the view is incredible." />
