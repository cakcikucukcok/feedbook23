  <title>Living Wittingly - Bishop Dr. Edward Barnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does it really make a difference what we do or how we do it? Are there strict rules and steps to follow? Can we afford to be careless, thoughtless, reckless, and oblivious to the very real consequences of failing to be deliberate in our actions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine if we lived our lives each day fully aware of the Word of God, ever mindful of the meanings and final results of every action. What if we made up our minds consciously and deliberately to adhere to every line and precept? What if every move and thought was intentional and purposeful as we seek to please God, learn more about Him, and share His love with others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living Wittingly takes us on a journey as we answer the many questions about our walk with God.  There is nowhere better than the Word of God to discover the tools of living wittingly, intentionally, and victoriously.&lt;/p&gt;" />
