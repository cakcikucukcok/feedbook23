  <title>New Life in Christ Jesus - Bret Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Learn to Walk in Newness of Life!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two thousand years ago, the Creator of the universe died on a cross for our sins and rose from the dead. Today, He draws all people to Himself and gives eternal life to everyone who believes in Him. For those of us who have trusted in Him, the most amazing thing is that Jesus Christ now lives in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what does it really mean that Jesus lives in our hearts? In amazing detail, &lt;i&gt;New Life in Christ Jesus&lt;/i&gt; shows from the Scriptures that Jesus presence means that we have everything we need for life and godliness:&lt;/p&gt;
It means we are Gods children, His offspring.&lt;br&gt;
It means we have His Divine NAture (His DNA).&lt;br&gt;
It means we have His life, His righteousness, and His holiness.&lt;br&gt;
It means He leads, guides, and directs us from inside our hearts.&lt;br&gt;
It means our sins are forgiven completely and forever.&lt;br&gt;
It means we may walk with Him in the newness of life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick up &lt;i&gt;New Life in Christ Jesus&lt;/i&gt; and learn how to take advantage of this platform God has given us for godly living. Learn to trust the Holy Spirit when He speaks to you. Learn to recognize the righteousness you possess in Christ. Learn to accept in full His forgiveness for all the shortcomings of your flesh. Learn to walk free of the law without using your liberty as a cloak for vice. And learn to resist every effort of man and spirit to move you from this course.&lt;/p&gt;" />
