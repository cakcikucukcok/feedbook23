R. M. Runyon watches helplessly as the course of his life takes a dramatic turn.

Can the man who has spent his life providing answers and giving guidance to others find answers for himself when everything is gone?&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

He learns from Mary that God can birth something meaningful and important in a life even when no one else understands. In the midst of what appears to be utter chaos and pain, he gains a new life, greater insight and unparalleled personal growth. He finds that God reigns in dark unfamiliar places too.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
