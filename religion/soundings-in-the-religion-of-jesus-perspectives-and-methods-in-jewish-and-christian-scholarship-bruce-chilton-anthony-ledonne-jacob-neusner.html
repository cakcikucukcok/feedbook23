  <title>Soundings in the Religion of Jesus: Perspectives and Methods in Jewish and Christian Scholarship - Bruce Chilton, Anthony LeDonne, Jacob Neusner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Jesus was a Jew and not a Christian. That affirmation may seem obvious, but here an international cast of Jewish and Christian scholars spell out its weighty and often complex consequences for contemporary Jewish-Christian dialogue. Soundings in the Religion of Jesus contextualizes Jesus and the writings about him that set the stage for Jewish-Christian relations for the next 2000 years. Of equal importance, this book considers the reception, celebration, and (too often) the neglect of Jesus&amp;#39; Jewishness in modern contexts and the impact such responses have had for Jewish-Christian relations. Topics explored include the ethics of scriptural translation, the ideological motives of Nazi theologians and other &amp;quot;quests&amp;quot; for the Historical Jesus, and the ways in which New Testament portraits of Jesus both help and hurt authentic Jewish-Christian dialogue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
