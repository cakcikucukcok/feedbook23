  <title>Watch Israel - Larry E. Ellison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There really are three major sections of the book, &quot;Watch Israel&quot;.  The first is identifying why the current popular view of what is going to happen is wrong, and what we should be expecting instead.  The second section is about what the Bible has to say about life during the 1000 year kingdom era.  The third section is about what is going to happen at the end of the 1000 year kingdom era and why a major portion of prophecy expected in our near future will not occur until a thousand years from now. The temple in Jerusalem will not exist until Christ returns to supervise its construction. Once the temple in Jerusalem is built, Christ will rule the earth from there for 1000 years.  Thus it will not be possible for the Antichrist to set up the abomination of desolation there now before Christ returns.  Once Christ returns, he will totally control the whole earth.  At the end of the 1000 year kingdom the temple will exist to be occupied by the Antichrist and abomination of desolation at that time after Christ withdraws..
	The days of the US Dollar as the worlds reserve currency are numbered, 2013 will be the first year in which emerging markets account for more than half of worlds GDP on the basis of purchasing power. The BRIC nations have all built up huge currency reserves (mainly in U.S. dollars). Collectively, the four countries have about US$4.7 trillion in reserves, with China holding about US$3.5 trillion of that. 
	The next step forward in this convergence will be when an emerging-market currency challenges the reserve status of the U.S. dollar and an emerging financial market overtakes the one in the U.S.  The Chinese renminbi is already entrenched as one of the top 10 most-traded currencies in the world. And the Chinese domestic bond market is already the fourth largest  and its growing at 30% a year!  Eventually challenging the U.S. dollar as the worlds reserve currency. The transition wont happen overnight. But the wheels are already in motion. 
	Over the years, the United States has developed a bubble with their money and economy.  The Chinese have also developed their own bubble with their money and economy.  The showdown in Washington between the political parties about a government shutdown is about to occur again in January 2014.  This time could well cause the bubble to burst and a collapse in the value of the US dollar and US Treasury Bills.  One major result of this will be a drop in funding for the military and reduction of its military activities in the world.  This will further cause financial problems in the world.
	While this is going on we have Israel concerned about Iran developing necular weapons they could use against Israel. They have even stated that they will deal with Iran&#39;s efforts on their own if necessary to prevent it.  It is likely that Israel is eventually going to attack Iran in the near future to deal with their necular weapon effort.  This could trigger the invasion of Israel by the Russian army along with many Muslim nations around Israel and this battle is discussed in my book, &quot;Watch Israel&quot; along with various bible verses that predict this happening.
	The invasion of Israel cannot occur until the USA and England are no longer able to oppose it other than by their representatives speaking about it in the UN.  This is in the process of being set up in the form of the current financial disaster in the USA and is resulting in England and the rest of the world.  It will be the overspending of the US financial resources that will cause the US to stop being the policeman for the world and the result will leave Israel defenseless other than their own military which will be insufficient to stop the Russian led invasion.  This will be another sign of the nearness of the end.  Watch Israel for when they are on their own for defense as a sign of the nearness of the end.
	Another sign of the nearness of the return of Christ will be when the United States and Great Britain go into iso" />
