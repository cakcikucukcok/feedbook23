  <title>Plan to Live Forever - Jonathon C. Leise Cfp Awma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Aging is inevitable, but it sure beats the alternative! So as long as you are going to age anyway, you might as well take the steps and put in the work to age as well as possible and be the best older you that you can possibly be! As we age it is important that we have enough financial resources to do the things we need to do to age well and to enjoy whatever lifestyle we chose to lead. So planning to live forever must include planning to accumulate sufficient financial resources to make your money last forever. I like to call this combination of aging well and having the financial resources to do sofinancial gerontology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a guide to the proper steps we can take, or seeds we can plant, to live your best, longest, most prosperous, and most impactful life. What follows in these pages is meant to make you believe that you have the power and ability to make life better for yourself and others. In fact, if you learn enough, avoid some of the serious mistakes many people make, and get on the road to good health and financial freedom, you can change not only your life but the lives of those you love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
