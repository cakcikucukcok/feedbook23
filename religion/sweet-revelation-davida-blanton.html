  <title>Sweet Revelation - Davida Blanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How is the God of heaven showing Himself to the world? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How has He shown Himself to you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sweet Revelation is one womans revelation story, a narrative memoir written to people in all walks of life. Author Davida Blanton describes times throughout her life when God showed Himself real to her. In her darkest moments of fear, disappointment, and grief, Gods arm brought comfort to Davida and healed her brokenness, wrapping her in truth, embracing her in love, protecting her in light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word revelation means an unveiling. When something is unveiled before our eyes, it is made visible. When eternal things are unveiled before us, allowing us to see in the spiritual realm, our lives are affected in profound ways. We are changed. This happens differently for each person, because every man and woman has unique needs and experiences. This book tells how its happened for one woman and invites you to consider how its happened in your own life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Jesus said, The person who has my commands and keeps them really loves me; and whoever really loves me...I will love him and will show Myself to him. I will let Myself be clearly seen by him and make Myself real to him. (John 14:21 AMP) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation of the sweetest kind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Words of Christ recorded in Revelation 3:18 (NKJV) &lt;/p&gt;" />
