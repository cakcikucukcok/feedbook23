  <title>911 Hello Mr. God - Rev. Rayka Stasiak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We have struggled for the last 2,000 years with the karmic lessons and experiences of power, technology and love.  Now we are entering a new evolutionary period calling for the balancing of the scientific and spiritual worlds within the individual and planet.  Mankind stands at the thresholds, the decision point of whether to accept what it is being told by the masses is for the highest and best good or instead to listen to its own inner voice.  At the heart of the matter is the opportunity to choose to cooperate rather than compete, brotherly love and assistance rather than hate and violence.  It is time to observe objectively and logically the world situations that have resulted from fear and competition; which is against Universal Law.  
There are certain responsibilities we must face.  We are responsible for our own thoughts and actions.  We have made agreements a long time ago that we will have to face if we wish to reach true self freedom.  This book will help us improve our understanding of life from both a human and spiritually based perception.
After internalizing this information we may feel inspired to transform our life, heal ourselves and infect others with positive perceptions of life and greater compassion.  We will learn how to interact with Universal energy in a constructive manner so that we may better manage our reactions.  With a clearer understanding of spiritual energy and Universal Law we will be able to manage or stop the drama from repeating over and over again like a virus. It is now time to begin!" />
