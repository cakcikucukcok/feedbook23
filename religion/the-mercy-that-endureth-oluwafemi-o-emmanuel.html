  <title>The Mercy That Endureth - Oluwafemi O. Emmanuel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I think about the mercy of God especially toward this generation where there is less or no more regard for God Almighty as it were in those days; where everyone indulge themselves in evil act, where religion has become an excuse for an act of terror, where the love of money has replaced the love of God even in the heart of the believers, where corruption has become the order of the day, where youth idolizes the things of the world and lust after its immorality, where knowledge has become a snare and wisdom a pestilence to the citizen of the world. Then this I concluded in my heart that if God can be patient enough to delay His wrath of His judgement over the world in general, then I think it is an understatement to say He is merciful but I will rather say God Himself is the definition, the true depiction and the description of mercy.
This book reveals the deep things about the mercy of God which many Christians don&#39;t really realize. What more did you know about the mercy of God and what can we say about its efficacy. But the mercy of God is way beyond what we think and we need to learn a little more about it, that we might appreciate God." />
