  <title>The Sevens Pattern - Lloyd C. Elson Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Sevens Pattern is the first time ever seen and its been hidden within the 66 books of the Bible all this time, Till now. 
Many others have brought forward books that say they have decoded the Scriptures, and some of them may even say theyve solved the mysteries of Scripture. Yet, how do they prove it? Does their method prove itself? The Sevens Pattern is a journey toward the ultimate of all truths. Lloyd Elson Jr. has written this manuscript with one intention alone, and that is to show people in this world that there is far more to Scripture than words that are read. Scripture is one of the most intriguing hiding places for The Sevens Patterns it was so fascinating to me from the moment I started seeing its pattern .Patterns have been realized by some, shared by some, but they are nothing in comparison to that of what Lloyd Elson Jr. is preparing to reveal in his work and discovery. It is when we go deeper, to the source within that which was given to Lloyd Jr., where we will find a discovery that, like Lloyd Elson Jr., pulled me into, the mysteries, the hidden truths, that were put in Scripture unbeknownst to those who put the words on paper to share with the world. It is this that Lloyd Elson Jr. is bringing toward us, a key to a door previously unknown and unopened. That is something Lloyd Elson Jr. has captured in the work he has done. It is something he is capable of bringing to life in every conversation we have ever shared. It is for this reason that his work should be seen as more than just a thought on a whim, and is what can be seen in the work that Lloyd Elson Jr. has done, whether youre seeing it for the first time, or are seeing it for the thousandth, it never loses its powerful edge." />
