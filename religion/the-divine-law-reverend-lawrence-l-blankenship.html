  <title>The Divine Law - Reverend Lawrence L. Blankenship</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;GOOD AND EVIL was written at the suggestion of some Bible students and was limited in scope to personal hygiene and disease pre-vention...how to keep healthy, stay young and live long...yet it was described by God Words and reader as Holy Bible in content because of my simple, direct and unpretentious style of writing. This book was written in the very same style and contains the answers to all the spiritual and medical problems of possible interest to the individual, to the family and to the community.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Good and Evil is regarding God, Satan, Sinful Disease, Seven Deadly Sins, the Sheep and the Goats, and Prayer cannot be rightly 
understood without some knowledge of general history during the millennium before Jesus Christ. The Bible is not only a book for 
Christians but a national literature, which needs to be studied, like any other literature, from an esthetic and historical point of view.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Divine Law: Good and Evil is Reverend Lawrence L. Blankenship&lt;/i&gt; sixth book in this series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
