  <title>With Healing in His Wings: A Complete and Concise Presentation of God&#39;s Healing Gospel - Douglas H. Pessoni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;With Healing in His Wings: A Complete and Concise Presentation of God&#39;s Healing Gospel&lt;/i&gt; offers an examination of divine healing that emphasizes ways to build personal faith and claim the healing that God promises. Through scriptural teachings, the author shares the tenets of this commonly misunderstood blessing and outlines the principles of faith. &lt;br&gt;Utilizing both Old and New Testament teachings, this insightful study addresses common questions and advises the reader on appropriate actions when seeking to claim God&#39;s healing. In addition, &lt;i&gt;With Healing in His Wings: A Complete and Concise Presentation of God&#39;s Healing Gospel&lt;/i&gt; confronts the enemies of healing, and offers inspiring testimonies of faith.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Douglas H. Pessoni is a minister and author.  For many years the author suffered from severe seasonal allergies, asthma, and eczema.  It was necessary to carry several medications with him in case of a sudden attack.  Since there were no medical cures for these diseases, the medications were used to simply counter the symptoms.  When the author was introduced to the healing Gospel, he put his complete hope and trust in Jesus to heal him and practiced the principles outlined in this book.  From that time forward and for the past fifteen years, he has been totally healed of these diseases. &lt;br&gt;It was this experience that has driven the author to spread the healing Gospel and to enter into the healing ministry.  Over the past fifteen years he has been privileged to witness the awesome healing power of the Holy Spirit through his ministry.  Hundreds of people have been healed of severe pain, profound orthopedic problems, cancers, diverse viral and bacterial infections, vision and dental problems, allergies, depression and anxiety, high cholesterol, injury, and many others." />
