  <title>Books Written in Stone: Volume 1 - J. Marc. Merrill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Great Pyramid--mysteries abound . . . 
&lt;p&gt;
For example:
&lt;p&gt;
Why was the subterranean chamber apparently abandoned and yet it is larger than the Queen&#39;s Chamber and the King&#39;s Chamber combined?
&lt;p&gt;
Why is there a pit in the floor of the subterranean chamber, and why does the narrow passage that snakes south off the subterranean chamber come to a sudden end after 53 feet?
&lt;p&gt;
Why was sand from the Sinai hidden behind the wall of the horizontal passage to the Queen&#39;s Chamber, and why is there a sudden drop in that passage?
&lt;p&gt;
Why was the Grand Gallery built so large in comparison to the ascending passage, and why are the slots in the ramps of the Grand Gallery empty?
&lt;p&gt;
Why was the antechamber to the King&#39;s Chamber built with both limestone and granite blocks, and what purpose could the so-called Granite Leaf have served?
&lt;p&gt;
Egyptologists, pyramidologists, and others outside these two camps have attempted to explain such anomalies.  Their theories are examined and compared to a new vision that answers not just some of the questions about the Great Pyramid but all of them as revealed in Books Written in Stone: Enoch the Seer, the Pyramids of Giza, and the Last Days.&lt;br&gt;" />
