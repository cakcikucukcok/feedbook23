  <title>When God Laughs with Us: The Lighter Side of Leadership - David L. McKenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lighten up!   Most of us take ourselves too seriously. Christian leaders, in particular, are tempted by the position they hold, or the power they wield, to lose touch with their humanity, become arrogant, and alienate their followers.   But what about our tendency to shoot ourselves in the foot, time and time again? Can we laugh at ourselves?   David McKenna, a Christian college president, brings a lifetime of learning to this question. By confessing his own foibles and laughing at the ludicrous, he finds that God is laughing with him--not to ridicule, but to give the special grace that saves us from ourselves.   The lessons are humbling when the laugh is on us, but they can lead to the discovery that a sense of humor is a partner with the witness of a joyful spirit. McKenna shows us by example how to lighten up and find God as we laugh at ourselves." />
