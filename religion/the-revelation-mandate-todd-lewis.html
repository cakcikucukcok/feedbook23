  <title>The Revelation Mandate - Todd Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Book of Revelation is the summation and capstone of Scripture, showing Jesus Christ in all of his ascended glory. Intimately interwoven is the presentation of the Church as His beloved bride. Revelation clarifies the mandate and plan of action of this everlasting union and priesthood of Christ and his Church. If the Church today seems weak, in retreat, and culturally irrelevant, Revelation gives us the cure. The command to overcome is the same for the Church today as it was in Johns day. She is called, in all generations, to reject doctrines of defeat, literalist fantasy, and vain speculation about the future and to embrace Her commission to rule. Reconciling all things in heaven and on earth in Christ Jesus is the Churchs historical task and the basis of Her heavenly reward. &lt;i&gt;The Revelation Mandate &lt;/i&gt;is a fully accessible and completely biblical study that demystifies the message of Revelation so that we all may fulfill our high calling in Christ.&lt;p&gt;" />
