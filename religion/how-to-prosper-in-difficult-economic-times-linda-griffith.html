  <title>How to Prosper in Difficult Economic Times - Linda Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How to Prosper in Difficult Economic Times is for everyone born without a silver spoon and without a family member whose name adorns one of the buildings at the nearest Ivy League school. This writing is for anyone who has faced or is facing hardship, stress, or hopelessness of a financial nature. If thats you, I encourage you to continue. Within these pages are the lessons Ive learned through the hardships of my own journey, set and explained within the context of my circumstances, and how those circumstances have drastically changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I received your book yesterday and read it through last night. You have a powerful and encouraging testimony, thank you for sharing it with us. I also appreciate you distinguishing between just hoping and actually believing God in prayer, that message was very timely for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am in the process of reading your book, I am halfway through and I all I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started reading your book, I couldnt put it down! It was so inspiring, I had to read every word!&lt;/p&gt;" />
