God is seeking us at ALL time to reveal things to us we know not of. This book gives you insights how to maintain a quality relationship with the &quot;Christ The Messiah The Anointed One.&quot; I&#39;ve  also outlined is specific instructions how to get into God presence, read it and you will never be the same." />
