  <title>Maturation Through Marriage - Lowell Lueck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At first look, it seems logical Christian maturity and preparation for eternity would go hand in hand with marriage. But when one delves deeper and takes a look at statistics, it does not always work that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maturation through Marriage: And the Enticement of Divorce&lt;/em&gt; takes an honest look at author Lowell Luecks theological and spiritual reflection on the texture and contours of the fabric of his married life. It does not shy away from honestly portraying his sins but balances those statements of shortcoming with equally powerful reminders of the consolation and guidance from the Scriptures. Lueck found faulty applications or fundamental violations of Biblical principles by Christian spouses and the Christian church have allowed the tragic destruction of families. Lack of adaptation to no-fault divorce statutes; frustration of trying to apply biblical principles to our twenty-first-century Western worldview of love, dating, and marriage; and the unwillingness of the church to uphold Godly encouragement and accountability are some of the issues Lueck addresses. As a Christian marriage and family therapist with two failed marriages, he writes from an insiders perspective and with a willingness to share his shame of these experiences and also his deliverance from the false guilt that he had carried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in an easy-to-understand manner, &lt;em&gt;Maturation through Marriage: And the Enticement of Divorce&lt;/em&gt; is not just theory. Based upon the authors firsthand experience, this book can help you deal with the same or similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;" />
