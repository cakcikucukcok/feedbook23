  <title>Get Right Church &amp; Let&#39;s Go Home - Cassandra J. Snyder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Get Right Church and Lets Go Home is a book birthed from the spirit of God. Just imagine sitting at the foot of the throne with pen and paper and God telling you why He is concerned for the body of Christ. Just imagine God allowing you to feel His emotions for His people.  If you can just picture the cross and the price that was paid and how the price has become so insignificant to the Church, then you can understand what this book is designed to accomplish. 
The things written in this book come straight from the word of God.  The only way to dispute it is to dispute the word, the truth.  I often tell my children that the truth is the truth whether you choose to accept it or not.  You can analyze it.  You can show what you think is a better way.  You can even convince a nation that what you say is true, but when Jesus Christ returns and declares the truth, that will be it. All issues will be settled, all arguments will cease, all those who are going to heaven will go, and all those who are not will go to hell. 
No, it is not a damnation and hellfire book.  It is a book written out of love.  If God did not love us, He would not bother to reach us.  He could just allow us to continue in this worlds deception and end up where many of us are now, separated from Him.  The words get right let us know that it is not too late.  This book is just a warning to let the Church and the world know that time is not on our side. Time is insignificant to God but it means everything to us.  When time ends it ends. Everyone will go to heaven once: some to be judged and some to be welcomed home. This book is designed to help you get home!" />
