  <title>Life in Tension - Stephen W Hiemstra, Reid Satterfield, Nathanael Snow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When God comes into our lives, we change.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new identity is in Christ comes into tension with our old identity in ourselves as the Holy Spirit works in our hearts and minds. This tension arises between who we were and who God created us to be, between us and God, and between us and those around us. The Apostle Paul calls the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives sanctification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life in Tension reflects biblically on the Beatitudes offering analysis, prayer, and questions for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hear the words; Walk the steps; Experience the joy!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life in Tension &lt;/em&gt;reflects on Jesus&amp;#39; Beatitudes in the context of scripture. The Beatitudes serve as an introduction to the Sermon on the Mount and lays out Jesus&amp;#39; priorities in teaching his disciples. Because the sermon serves as a kind of ordination service for the Apostles, the importance of the Beatitudes for the early church, Christian spirituality, and discipleship today cannot be overstated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author Stephen W. Hiemstra (MDiv, PhD) is a slave of Christ, husband, father, tentmaker, writer, and speaker. He lives with Maryam, his wife of 30+ years, in Centreville, VA and they have three grown children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What people are saying...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We live in a fallen world. It leads to life in tension, and sometimes a life full of stress. Stephen Hiemstra takes us on a needed tour of the kind of character it takes to face such a life. &lt;/em&gt;- Darrell L. Bock, Dallas Theological Seminary&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We don&amp;#39;t often think of our life as one lived in tension, but as believers that&amp;#39;s exactly how we live.
