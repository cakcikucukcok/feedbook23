  <title>Mind Sciences - Todd Ehrenborg, Alan W. Gomes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is evil a state of mind that can be changed? Is there a latent divinity in us all? Is there a personal God? The answers to these questions given by the mind sciences: groups such as Christian Science, Religious Science, and the Unity School of Christianity are not the same ones given by orthodox Christianity. Moreover, these mind sciences appeal to many people who seek cures to illness that conventional medicine and Christianity do not offer. Can we put our trust in them? Why this series? This is an age when countless groups and movements, old and new, mark the religious landscape in our culture, leaving many people confused or uncertain in their search for spiritual truth and meaning. Because few people have the time or opportunity to research these movements fully, these books provide essential information and insights for their spiritual journeys. Each book has five sections: - A concise introduction to the group - An overview of the group&#39;s theology in its own words - Tips for witnessing effectively to members of the group - A bibliography with sources for further study - A comparison chart that shows the essential differences between biblical Christianity and the group -- The writers of these volumes are well qualified to present clear and reliable information and help us discern religious truth from falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
