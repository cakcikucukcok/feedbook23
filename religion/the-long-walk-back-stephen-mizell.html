  <title>The Long Walk Back - Stephen Mizell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Failure is something we have all experienced. We have also watched the public failures of people that resulted in many lives being affected. It is painful to watch someones life as their career, family, and finances go to shambles because of their poor choices. It is even more painful to experience all that personally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are consequences to every choice we make. Failure can be devastating. The losses seem almost impossible to overcome. But nothing could be further from the truth. There is a path back to success and fulfillment. The question is, will we take it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will carry you on one mans journey to the depths of failure and back to healing and fulfillment. It was a long walk back, but it was worth every step.&lt;/p&gt;" />
