  <title>My Father’S Business - Dwayne Lopes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many of the millions of born again Christians worldwide are unsure of God&#39;s will for their lives. Designed to spiritually enlighten born again believers and lost souls. &lt;em&gt;My Father&#39;s Business&lt;/em&gt; offers divine guidance that will help spiritual seekers to carry out the Lord&#39;s calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author &lt;strong&gt;Dwayne Lopes&lt;/strong&gt; is an ordained minister and the creator of an award-winning Christian television program. He relies upon practical answers found in the Bible in order to provide direction for those who want to serve God. Dwayne begins by sharing the story of Jeremiah a weeping prophet who often showers his prophecies in tears of compassion and through the example of the disciples teaches others to receive gifts from God through prayer. Dwayne continues to enlighten spiritual awareness and growth by highlighting the work of several prophets who taught valuable lessons about the word of God, the afterlife, repentance, and God&#39;s will for their lives as well as our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bible declares many are called, but few are chosen. Many people are called by God like many are called by telemarketers, survey-takers, and bill collectors over the phone. However, God&#39;s call and his gifts are irrevocable and his call to live the lives he intended for us to live should always be answered. Few are chosen by God to lead, but many are called by God to serve as laborers and help those in leadership as well as others in the world. This book is written and geared not for the few, but for the many, and the spiritual leadership offered in &quot;My Father&#39;s Business&quot; will help the many eager followers on their own journeys to both discover and live the will of our heavenly Father.&lt;/p&gt;" />
