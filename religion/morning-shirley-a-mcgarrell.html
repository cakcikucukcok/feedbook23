  <title>Morning - Shirley A. McGarrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="O Glorious morning! What a wonderful day!
Mornings are always full of expectation and hope for the days they bring forth.  Each day, they shed a new light on life. The dew in the morning before the sunrise, is a soft touch that starts the day, which could be full of activity, or a day of slumber and relaxation. The beauty of morning is that it can never be the same for each day. It will always be new. It will always be different. And it will always be a gift.
In the Maracas Valley of St. Joseph, Trinidad, where the author and her beloved husband, Roy, have resided for the past twenty-plus years, the morning mist veils the sun, and allows for a gentle movement into each new day.  Mornings are about rebirth.
This book about mornings presents a unique opportunity to look at the start of a variety of new beginnings, each with its own portent. The author moves the reader along on the journey of each special day. She receives what is presented, and works with it, never leaving hope behind.  I can personally testify to this. She gave me hope and raised me up at a time when I had to dig deep to find it.  She demonstrates how life has value for her in spite of what is thrown her way. She accepts her slice, and moves on like a flowing river. 
This book has a message for persons in all walks of life, and of all ages. Its messages are profound without being weighty. In essence, they are fresh, like the early morning breeze in the Maracas Valley of St. Joseph.  It is her hope that readers will be blessed by bringing a fresh-breeze-perception to every morning." />
