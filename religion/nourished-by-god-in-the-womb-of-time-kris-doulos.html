  <title>Nourished by God in the Womb of Time - Kris Doulos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri&quot;&gt;God placed many parallels to the spiritual realm in the physical universe so the human brain could get some idea of the world that exists beyond the capacity of the human brain. One such parallel is the development of a baby in a mothers womb.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Just as God took particles of the earth and made a body for the spirit he created, a woman takes the particles of her body and makes a body for a spirit that will live in that body. That body is developed inher womb and, at birth, that body becomes a womb for a human spirit. The author calls this newborn body &lt;B style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal&quot;&gt;The Womb of Time&lt;/B&gt; because it is the place where a human spirit is developed in time in preparation for an existence in a new world called Eternity.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Calibri&quot;&gt;An embryo in a mothers womb is surrounded by chemicals that can prevent it from developing to a point capable of living in the world outside its womb. In the same way, a human spirit, in the womb of its body, is surrounded by &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Calibri&quot;&gt;knowledge&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;, the curse from Eden that can prevent it from developing to a point capable of being a spirit with lifewhen it enters eternity. If a physical body is stillborn, no matter how much it is loved it cannot exist with people who are alive. A human spirit that is not alive when its body dies cannot exist with the living who reside in Heaven. God is constantly trying to nourish people in their &lt;B style=&quot;mso-bidi-font-weight: normal&quot;&gt;Womb of Time&lt;/B&gt; with the same Word of Life he used to create all things. The human brain, limited to the knowledge it contains, often substitutes confidence for faith and religion for God causing many human spirits to be stillborn when they leave their body. Man&#39;s battle is between &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Calibri&quot;&gt;knowledge&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; and &lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Calibri&quot;&gt;faith&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;.A quick look at the world will reveal the incompetence of knowledge.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
