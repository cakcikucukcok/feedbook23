  <title>Keep Holding On - Christopher Eubanks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever been traveling through life like nothing is wrong? Living your life like everything was great? Then all of the sudden, you hit a brick wall, and everything just collapses around you? This was what happened to me and my wife. God had to take drastic measures to get our attention. That&#39;s when my wife got sick. She spent three months in the hospital and almost died. This book is a brief history of what we experienced during her illness and the things that God taught us through this illness. I hope that this book will help others to look into their lives and make sure they are doing what God wants from them, before He has to take drastic measures to get your attention. This is the true story of the struggle, and lessons God taught m wife and I over a two year span, following her life threatening illness." />
