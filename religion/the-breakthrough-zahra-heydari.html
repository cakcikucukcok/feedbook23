  <title>The Breakthrough - Zahra Heydari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As an eleven-year-old girl living in Iran, Zahras live was forever changed after her father was killed instantly in a car accident. In this firsthand account, Zahra recounts her journey of personal growth and intimate relationship with God that ultimately gave her the strength to end her abusive twenty-three-year marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this tale of self-growth, Zahra describes her daily struggles as a mother and a wife, and the spiritual transformation that led her to independence. From dealing with her fathers tragic death to her rushed marriage to a man she hardly knew, Zahra shares her intimate conversations with God and how he has been there every step of the way, to help guide her through the pain, tears, dark days, and ultimately to the joy she has found today. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her faith in God allowed her to find the courage to seek justice when she thought no one was out there and enabled her to end her destructive cycle of marriage. It inspired her to follow her dreams and led her to find her passion in life. The Breakthrough demonstrates the power of God and the inspiration that can be found among those who believe in him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
