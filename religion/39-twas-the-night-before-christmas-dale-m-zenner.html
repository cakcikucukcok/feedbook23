  <title>&#39;Twas the Night Before Christmas - Dale M. Zenner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&#39;Twas The Night Before Christmas is the one book that will last a lifetime in the hearts and minds of your children and grandchildren. Although the title would indicate a Christmas story, your child will not only enjoy reading about the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, but will follow His life through teaching in the temple, inspiring the gospels, feeding the five thousand, healing the sick, raising the dead and sharing His love. All through His life, your child will see the wonderful illustrations depicting these glorious times including the resurrection. This surely is a gift that keeps on giving not only at Christmas, but everytime the story is read. We are all disciples, and there is no better way to spread His word than through His story. You can testify for Him today by sharing His book with as many children, grandchildren and friends as you feel led. May our Lord Bless your ministry!&lt;/p&gt;" />
