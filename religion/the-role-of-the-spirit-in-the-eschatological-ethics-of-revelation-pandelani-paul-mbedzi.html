  <title>The Role of the Spirit in the Eschatological Ethics of Revelation - Pandelani Paul Mbedzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The role of the spirit in the eschatological ethics of revelation was a topic that has given me great joy to learn the book of Revelation the role of the spirit, eschatological and ethics. In this book, I have discovered the plan of salvation, which was laid before the foundation of the world in a very clear manner. God, the master of the universe, revealed to John the final story of this worlds history at the Isles of Patmos. 
The trinity is well-explained and even their duties as the Godhead. God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost of which my dissertation is looking at the office or the role of the spirit in the second coming of Christ. From Genesis to Malachi, it is God the Father who revealed himself to mankind, and from Matthew to Acts 1:8, it is God the Son who came in person to reveal God the Father, and from Acts 1:9, to Revelation it is God the Holy Spirit who will teach us all that God the son could not finish teaching us. 
The script is divided into five chapters, which are the orientation into the book of Revelation, the theology and the ethics of the book Revelation, the eschatology ethics in Revelation, the Holy Spirit in Revelation, and the role of the spirit and eschatology ethics of Revelation, which is the theme of this script. Then we have the conclusion of the script." />
