  <title>Don&#39;t Waste Your Life - John Piper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Piper writes, &quot;I will tell you what a tragedy is. I will show you how to waste your life. Consider this story from the February 1998 Reader&#39;s Digest: A couple &#39;took early retirement from their jobs in the Northeast five years ago when he was 59 and she was 51. Now they live in Punta Gorda, Florida, where they cruise on their 30-foot trawler, play softball and collect shells. . . .&#39; Picture them before Christ at the great day of judgment: &#39;Look, Lord. See my shells.&#39; That is a tragedy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;God created us to live with a single passion: to joyfully display his supreme excellence in all the spheres of life. The wasted life is the life without this passion. God calls us to pray and think and dream and plan and work not to be made much of, but to make much of him in every part of our lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most people slip by in life without a passion for God, spending their lives on trivial diversions, living for comfort and pleasure, and perhaps trying to avoid sin. This book will warn you not to get caught up in a life that counts for nothing. It will challenge you to live and die boasting in the cross of Christ and making the glory of God your singular passion. If you believe that to live is Christ and to die is gain, read this book, learn to live for Christ, and don&#39;t waste your life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
