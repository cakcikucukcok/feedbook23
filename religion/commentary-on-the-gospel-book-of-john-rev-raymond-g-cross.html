  <title>Commentary on The Gospel Book of John - Rev. Raymond G Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning!&lt;/strong&gt; The Bible is the most misunderstood and mysterious book ever written. Although a best seller, the bible is rarely read or thoughtfully analyzed except by ministers and theologians. The Bibles words actually have the power to change people&amp;rsquo;s lives and cultures, making them better. Being the least read of all books, it usually sits on a shelf or coffee table unopened. However, it is also the most true, most informative and most reliable of all books. If you want to know humankind&amp;rsquo;s past, present and future, understand the Word of God, the Bible. God tells us in &lt;strong&gt;Jeremiah 29:11&lt;/strong&gt; - For I know the plans I have for you, declares the LORD, plans for [your] welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. &lt;strong&gt;KJV&lt;/strong&gt;. The Bible presents God&amp;rsquo;s plans for humanity, from creation to eternity. However, true knowledge requires instruction and PICTURE enlightenment that can only be provided by the Holy Spirit. God has spoken through men in the Scripture and through His contemporary followers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
