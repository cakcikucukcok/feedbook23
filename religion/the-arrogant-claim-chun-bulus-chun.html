If you are diluted with your life and the church, you have chosen the right material to seek answers with. Because this small book brings to bear Mark 1s message of The kingdom of God is at hand, new government on earth and Jesus reintroduce the kingdom. God has to invade the earth because there is already a government on earth, opposing the kingdom of the light. This book is a reminded that you are saved to serve. We try to answer and make the case that the church is the answer to the world. Colossians 1: The church here which in Greek refers to as ecclesia, the call out ones or those to legislate the kings decree.
