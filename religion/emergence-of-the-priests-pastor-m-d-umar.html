  <title>Emergence of the Priests - Pastor M. D. Umar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Too precious is the blood of the Lamb Jesus that was slain to be trodden under the foot. And men shall not be allowed to do respite to the Spirit of grace by whom we are sealed unto salvation. The church must fulfill her purpose and ordained destiny. The church is permitted to remain in the world for an end that is, to be the light bearer to those who are in the darkness of unbelief through ignorance. However, the activities and stench of wolves in sheep clothing styling themselves as shepherds in the house of our God has reached the highest heavens. Judgment is about to begin and that must be from the very threshold of the house of God.
The Church was designed and created to be light bearers to the world. But, the church herself needed light due to the decadence that has set in because of her adultery with the world. Her (the church) inter-meddling with the world has eclipsed the original glory of God.
The prophets within her wall prophesy for bread and divine for silver and for gold. Her doctrines are dubbed with untempered mortar and her gospel has been watered down and as such, lacks the inherent power, grace, and life to transform depraved men into the likeness of their master Jesus, which was the original design and purpose of the gospel. In addition, the quest for economic paradise here and now, has veiled the glory of the world to come, in the heart of men. We can no longer distinguish between the clean and the unclean, the saved and the unsaved, the church and the world. Truth, which is the hub of Christianity, has fallen at the gate, and those that seek after godliness and His righteousness has made themselves a prey amongst the sons of men." />
