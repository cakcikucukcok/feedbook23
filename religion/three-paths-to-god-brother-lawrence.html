  <title>Three Paths to God - Brother Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Collected in this omnibus edition are three classic works exploring the mystical nature of God. Included are The Practice of the Presence of God by Brother Lawrence, Interior Castle by St. Teresa of Avila, and Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross. The Practice of the Presence of God is one of the most beautiful and touching stories of Christian devotion ever written. This is the definitive edition of St. Teresa of Avila&#39;s Interior Castle: translated by E. Allison Peers. This mystic book is as inspirational and enlightening today as it was when it was first written. St. Teresa lays out the foundation for an ideal journey of faith. St. Teresa was a reformer of the Carmelite Order and is considered to be, along with Saint John of the Cross, a founder of the Discalced Carmelites. She became the first female to be named a Doctor of the Church, in 1970, and is one of only three females to be awarded that honor. Dark Night of the Soul is considered one of the greatest religious poems ever written. This masterpiece of Mystic Christianity examines faith and how to keep faith when all seems lost. Think of it as guide to making it through the dark night of the soul to the brighter, happier, faith filled tomorrow that awaits. St. John of the Cross was a Carmelite friar and priest; he is renowned for his cooperation with Saint Teresa of Ávila in the reformation of the Carmelite order, and for his poetry and his studies on the growth of the soul." />
