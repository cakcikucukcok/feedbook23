  <title>Revelation Logically - E.T. Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When sitting down to write this book, E.T. Hudson said a prayer that Father God, in Jesus name, would help her understand the complicated book of Revelation. Then a dear friend began prompting her with questions of what this book is really about? What Is God trying to teach as he instructs his holy angels to give the writer, John, all this information?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us begin at the beginning. When God was creating the world, Jesus was in God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. (Genesis 1:1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning was the Word, the word was with God, and the Word was God.  All things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made. (John 1:1-3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the word was made flesh and dwelled among us and we beheld his glory. The glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and mercy. (John 1:14) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jesus says ten times in this book of Revelation that He is the first and the last. (Revelation 1:4, 1:11, 1:17, 2:8, 4:8, 11:17, 16:5, 21:6, and 22:13)God began this story with Jesus and ends his story with Jesus.When we read Revelation with these scriptures in mind, it makes a lot more sense, and as we place each bit of information about Jesus from Revelation 1:1-22:21 in chronological order we have a complete story of Jesus life from Genesis to Revelation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
