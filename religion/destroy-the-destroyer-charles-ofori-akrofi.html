  <title>Destroy the Destroyer - Charles Ofori Akrofi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world is waiting for the manifestation of the children of God for their salvation. Bitterness is one of the ways by which the devil makes sure that this manifestation does not happen. God is love and so should his children be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever done something for somebody and expected a thank you and there was absolute silence? What about a false accusation? Were you abused as a child or are you still being abused, betrayed or rejected? Have you ever been a victim of rape? Dismissed from your job unjustifiably or undermined at the work place? How does it feel when it is a wife, a husband or a loved one? It hurts even the more. If you are hurting as a result of being bitter or you want to help someone Destroy the Destroyer will assist you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Destroy the Destroyer&quot; will take you through some of the causes of bitterness with examples from the bible, its deadly effects on the individuals and how some of them dealt with it and how you can also deal with it. You will also find real interesting stories of people who lived in bitterness and how it affected their lives. Learn how to prevent bitterness from taking root in your life and free yourself from the prison of anger?&lt;/p&gt;" />
