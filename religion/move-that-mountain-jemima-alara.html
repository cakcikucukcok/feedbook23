But how can you manifest, when you are surrounded by mountains, which comes in forms of challenges, barriers, hindrances, strongholds, afflictions and a whole lot. Mountains cause pain, discomfort, obstruction and they hinder you from possessing and becoming all that God has ordained for you to become.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However you have the ability to say no to that mountain and to move it out of your way. But to be able to move any mountain at all, you need to know and identify the exact mountain confronting you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book you would,&lt;br /&gt;
