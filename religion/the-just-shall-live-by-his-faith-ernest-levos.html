  <title>The Just Shall Live by His Faith - Ernest LeVos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Justified by faith are the three words that capture the ministry and work of Martin Luther (14831546) and Charles Haddon Spurgeon (183492). For Spurgeon, one sentence produced the reformation, and it would be the main theme of his pastoral ministry from 1851 to 1892: But the just shall live by his faith.
The Just Shall Live by His Faith compiles a series of Charles Spurgeons sermons on justification by faith, Martin Luther, and the Reformation, and it covers the vital subjects of faith as the life and force in believers who have accepted the saving merits of the Lord Jesus Christ as the means of salvation. For such believers, the goal is to live their lives as they walk with the Spirit, and by dwelling on Spurgeons sermons we can learn that the lesson of the just living by faith will be the one seed that will germinate into the gift of justification, as if you have never sinned; this seed will continue to grow and lead to the Spirit-enabled transformation of human hearts. 
Spurgeons sermons on justification by faith echo the apostle Pauls most prominent teachings, and this doctrine still rings true today as the test of Christs church. All believers will be inspired by Spurgeons sermons to look to Christ for salvation, live by faith in every part of their lives, and have peace with God." />
