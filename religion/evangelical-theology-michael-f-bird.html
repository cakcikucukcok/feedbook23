  <title>Evangelical Theology - Michael F. Bird</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Evangelical Theology&lt;/EM&gt; is a systematic theology written from the perspective of a biblical scholar. Michael F. Bird contends that the center, unity, and boundary of the evangelical faith is the &lt;EM&gt;evangel&lt;/EM&gt; (= gospel), as opposed to things like justification by faith or inerrancy. The &lt;EM&gt;evangel&lt;/EM&gt; is the unifying thread in evangelical theology and the theological hermeneutic through which the various loci of theology need to be understood.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Using the gospel as a theological leitmotif—an approach to Christian doctrine that begins with the gospel and sees each loci through the lens of the gospel—this text presents an authentically evangelical theology, as opposed to an ordinary systematic theology written by an evangelical theologian.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;According to the author, theology is the drama of &lt;EM&gt;gospelizing&lt;/EM&gt;—performing and living out the gospel in the theatre of Christian life. The text features tables, sidebars, and questions for discussion. The end of every part includes a “What to Take Home” section that gives students a run-down on what they need to know. And since reading theology can often be dry and cerebral, the author applies his unique sense of humor in occasional “Comic Belief” sections so that students may enjoy their learning experience through some theological humor added for good measure.&lt;/P&gt;" />
