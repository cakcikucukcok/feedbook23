  <title>Living the Victory - Jere Probert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A premise of &lt;i&gt;Living the Victory&lt;/i&gt; is that Christians can and should be living life with noticeably different outcomes on a daily basis when compared to non-believers. The sovereignty of God and its impact on our walk is examined. The author uses Bible principles fleshed out with Bible examples of their implementation. Often this world examples of those principles are included as well.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Jeres teaching on spiritual warfare not only opened my eyes to realizing what we all have a battle against; it also gave me the tools I needed to stay on my feet like a Christian soldier should be able to. Daily life can be so much easier when people like Jere come forth and do what the Lord has put on his heart to dothat being sharing what he has learned about spiritual warfare. Thank you, Jere! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dennis Backes, Program Director, Faith Discipleship Center &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Jere Probert I learned to faith build. Jere would open each class with Romans 10:17 then open the classroom for sharing and discussing scripture. This taught me theimportance of scripture study, meditation and application of the Word to daily life. &lt;/p&gt;
