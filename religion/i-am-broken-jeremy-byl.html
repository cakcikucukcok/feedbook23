  <title>I Am Broken - Jeremy Byl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus, the Word of God. Many do not understand who He is in person. We as believers need to understand Him. He is the word. The world and universe were framed by Him as God would Speak He would proceed. In Gods ever great wisdom everything was made by Him. Nothing was made without Him. My brethren be ever understanding. When Jesus passed away on the cross God in His great wisdom and love passed this present universe and world away, since the Word was the holding , binding and creative force. As He said &quot;Behold I make all things new&quot;. By His death on the cross the present world was placed into his death under Gods wrath. But by Gods great love everyone who believes in Him will proceed into the new heavens and earth. How ? The Word was resurrected and will make all things new again as God speaks him forth. This time the world and universe soon to be will be framed by the resurrected Word which overcame sin and death. Being so that now the new heavens and earth will be in a ever state of no present sin or evil since Christ Jesus has abolished it once and For all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
