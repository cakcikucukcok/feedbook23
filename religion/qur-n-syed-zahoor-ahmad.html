  <title>Qurán - Syed Zahoor Ahmad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Mujahidin, (Al-Qaeda &amp; Taliban) yesteryears darlings who conferred a momentous favor on the United States and the West, are todays terrorists (which now includes ISIS fighters.) Is this volte-face a baptism of the remaking of the world order in the image of the West? Is the West provoking a clash of civilizations between the Christian and Islamic civilizations with the Christian churches in tandem, a crusade launched by President Bush, a born-again Christian sent by God on a special mission? In this ambience of conflict the Biblical quote Whoever is not with us is against us gains currency as the battle cry? On the Muslim front and in response, Wahabism, a fundamentalist creed that has strayed from the straight path of Islam, is rapidly gaining strength and is operating under different names. Wahabism provides the ideological support to them. They are the ones who are gearing themselves up to take on the world. We are aware of their capability. Their activities also portend disaster for mankind.
In this confrontational atmosphere the writer seeks guidance from the Qurn, a Book of guidance for mankind. Out of the myriad aspects, sixteen aspects of relevance to the problems humanity is currently facing are chosen.
In the process the author explodes the myths wound around ISRA, the night journey of the Prophet of Islam, Gabriel, heaven and hell, the Day of Judgment, mans final destiny etc.
The Qurnic observations, injunctions, exhortations, etc. relating to (1) Qurn (2) Divine (3) Muhammad (P.B.U.H) (4) Ilm (Knowledge) (5) Other Faiths (6) Social Justice (7) Women (8) Jihad (9) Terrorism (10) Justice (11) History (12) Economics (13) Genesis and Evolution of Man (14) Environment (15) Creation of the Universes and (16) Freewill and Determinism are the aspects brought out in this book.
To understand an important facet of todays geo-political reality and Islams guidance to mankind in these turbulent times, read this enlightening book." />
