  <title>Ladies of Legacy - Amber Albee Swenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted guidance but werent quite sure where to look? Romans 15:4 tells us, everything that was written in the past was written to teach us, so that through the endurance taught in the Scriptures and the encouragement they provide we might have hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each lady in the Bible serves as an example. Miriam teaches us to be content and stop grasping for power. Deborah models servant leadership. Ruths self-sacrifice would challenge even the most humble among us, while Naomi shows how easily bitterness can creep into our lives. The Queen of Sheba reminds us to search for wisdom but to look in the right place. Esther shows us how to overcome obstacles while being open to advice. Marthas account gets to the heart of distraction and service. Mary teaches us about unabashed worship. Tabitha knew to work for heavenly treasure rather than worldly gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single, married or widowed women will resonate with the issues these women and others in the Bible faced. Their legacies continue. We study them so the legacies we leave will be godly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
