  <title>Everybody for Everybody: Truth, Oneness, Good and and Beauty for Everyone&#39;s Life, Liberty and Pursuit of Happiness Volume 1 - Samuel A. Nigro Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="EVERYONE FOR EVERYONEthe book (volumes I &amp; II) by Samuel A. Nigro, M.D.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The Everybody for Everybody Book is the accumulation of what was learned over 70 plus years of life, over
45 years of marriage, over 40 years as a psychiatrist, 3 years in the U.S. Navy Submarine Service, and as a first
generation American with five children and ten grandchildren.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The planet and mankind are amazing. To limit ourselves to behaviors as if there is nothing more, is
contradicted by an accurate comprehensive understanding of the planet and the universe. Basically, love is
superior to all and the universe is the entropy necessary for the expression of love. Love itself requires there
to be more. Nothing more is a cruel joke that life and love are meaningless. All logic and reason demand
there be more, and we should act as if there is even much more love in anticipation. And if there isnt, then
there ought to be! Regardless, the world would be better by believing in such and acting as such.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The book provides some articles but most of it is the way to live a transcendental life: organized matter
sanctified and given a soul by identity, truth, oneness, good and beauty for everyones life, liberty, and pursuit
of happinesspartially the subtitle of the book. You get substance and the transcendental principles for
living that save by actuality for a change. This is in contrast to the virtual reality culture of the unreliable
manipulating self-discrediting noisy glitzy press&amp;media imposed substanceless non-being which, by
suggestibility, turns us into choiceless aliens instead of free persons for the planet. By the self-worshiping
self-discrediting press&amp;media, we are on the madman road-rage race to the bottom culture of pollution,
disgust, death, and decline. Not by this book.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Against vulgar suggestibility and glitz caused gullibility, this book gives real being by teaching six analogous
ways of living the wisdom-filled eight categories of metaphors of love in the cone of space-time:
&lt;br&gt;
As a human particle by elementary physicsevent, spectrum, field, quantum, singularity,
dimension, uncertainty, and force.
&lt;br&gt;
As a human being by community universalsdignity, unity, integrity, identity, spirituality,
life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
&lt;br&gt;
As a C/catholic, Roman or otherwise, by the sacramentsBaptism, Penance, Holy
Communion, Extreme Unction, Holy Orders, Matrimony, and Grace.
&lt;br&gt;
As a Christian by the virtuesfaith, hope, charity, prudence, justice, courage, temperance,
and holiness.
&lt;br&gt;
As a patient by the universal variables of all therapyliving things are precious, selective
ignoring, subdued spontaneity non-self excluded, affect assistance, detached warmth &amp;
gentleness, non-reactive listening, C2CC centered candidness, and peace &amp; mercy.
&lt;br&gt;
And  as sanctified by the last words of the crucified Christ.
Take your pick or combine them all.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Except for the quantity, it is simple. Thousands of aphorisms and concepts about every imaginable topic are
offered to teach ancient secrets from nature and natures God (to quote the Founding Fathers of America).
Interspersed in the book are the worlds first SEX SATIRES...fiery hilarious...which will help all cope with the
prurience flooding the world as entertainment, advertisement and games. SEX SATIRE, properly applied
to those exploiting sex, will free you from sex craziness and help keep societys prurience from disrupting
your transcendental life.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Read it through once; then a few pages or a chapter daily; and problem-solve as needed by index and
perusal. You will be better. The world will be better. You will learn to be a real human being for everyone.
And you will have your soul back by embracing the universal Mass mantra: life-sacrifice-virtue-lovehumanity-
peace-freedom-death." />
