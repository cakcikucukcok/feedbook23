  <title>Changing Lanes, Crossing Cultures - Andrew Philip Schachtel, Choon-Hwa Lim, Michael Kenneth Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many countries are now extremely multi-ethnic. People from numerous overseas countries have made their homes in other countries, but they often have very little contact with Christians, and minimal understanding of the gospel. This book is about helping Christians and churches to understand the WHY, WHAT, HOW and WHEN of vibrant cross-cultural ministries, and to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Changing Lanes, Crossing Cultures. Equipping Christians and churches for ministry in a culturally diverse society&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; is a very practical guide to cross-cultural ministry. Its three authors, Choon-Hwa Lim, Andrew Schachtel and Mike Wilson are all cross-cultural practitioners in Australia, with many years of experience between them. Although the book is written from an Australian background, the authors believe that much of it is applicable in a wide range of countries and situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why &amp;ldquo;Changing Lanes&amp;rdquo;? There&amp;rsquo;s an urgent need for Christians and churches to learn appropriate and effective new skills, and to change approaches and directions in how we do ministry. This book will help them to undertake the crucial, challenging but very rewarding process of changing lanes in an increasingly multicultural environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changing Lanes, Crossing Cultures&lt;/em&gt; includes an examination of the biblical motivation for cross-cultural ministry, steps to overcome obstacles, practical information on how to get involved and many helpful anecdotes and case studies. Each section contains thought-provoking questions for reflection and discussion. It&amp;rsquo;s written so that any person can pick it up and read it, or small-groups can study it over six sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
