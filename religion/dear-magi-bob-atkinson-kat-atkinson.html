  <title>Dear Magi - Bob Atkinson, Kat Atkinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One moment in time. A pivotal moment that would completely define their lives. The crucial moment they met. His seven-year-old heart melted. Her six-year-old heart missed it. In the years to come, at different phases of her life, he would take on many roles: her playmate, her family friend, her classmate, her defender, her pal, her neighbor, her boyfriend, her dear friend, andher old memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years passed before she was to see him as the man God intended for her. The moment came in a chance meeting. Her heart melted. His heart missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journey through time with Bob and Kathlyn as they discover who and whose they are. Mistakes were made, opportunities were granted, plans were lost, blessings were had. Prevenient grace carried them through, until love won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a story of a single thread winding through a half century, a thread that bound two hearts together. A story about second, third, and fourth chances. A story about faith, hope, and love. A story about Gods redemption of time that Satan had stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pivotal moments come for us all. Sometimes we recognize them, and sometimes we dont. Life goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When did your moments come? When did you take notice of them? The real question is, How does our amazing God keep giving and even return what was lost?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Read as this story unfolds to reveal Gods amazing providence, permissive will, and perpetual presence in the lives of these two hearts that were always meant, for His glory, to beat as one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
