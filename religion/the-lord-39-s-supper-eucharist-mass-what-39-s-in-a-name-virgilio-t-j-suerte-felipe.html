  <title>The Lord&#39;s Supper, Eucharist, Mass … What&#39;s in a Name? - Virgilio T.J. Suerte Felipe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA&quot;&gt;Throughout its long and rich history, the celebration of Christ&#39;s paschal mystery has been called by different names. In the Bible, the early Church initially designated it as &quot;the Lord&#39;s Supper&quot; and&quot; the Breaking of the Bread.&quot; Subsequently, it has been called Eucharist, Liturgy, Mystery, Sacrament, Sacrifice, Memorial, Mass, Real Presence, Paschal Banquet, and Communion. These twelve names of the Eucharist are used in the 2002 General Instruction of the Roman Missal which is the present manual for the celebration of Christ&#39;s paschal mystery. What is the history behind each name? Can we derive any theological meaning and pastoral implications from those names? Employing the threefold method of historical, theological, and pastoral investigations, Virgilio Suerte Felipe has also incorporated Pope Benedict XVI&#39;s recent Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Sacramentum Caritatis and Apostolic Letter Summorum Pontificum. This informative book will surely help not only teachers and students in schools but also pastors, lay leaders, and parishioners as well as religious communities. &lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
