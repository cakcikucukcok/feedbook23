  <title>100 Things I Learned in Heaven - Karen Bauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While living in Singapore in 1996, Karen Bauer, from Iowa, became ill and felt darkness descend upon her family. When the illness worsened and many frightening events began to occur, she consistently prayed to God and all of heaven for help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; After she had a traumatic brain injury in 2003, her spiritual vision was opened and she felt as though she was living in a nightmare while being fully awake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a last resort in 2004, she sought help from a spiritual healer and hypnotherapist from Hong Kong named Mabel. During her first meeting with her, a huge powerful angel appeared. From that moment on, she was changed forever. Hypnotherapy uncovered a near-death experience and severe head trauma from her childhood that catapulted her into these spiritual realms at an early age. The following years were saturated with many trips to heaven for lessons and healing and numerous angelic visitations. She was healed and she discovered her true soul purpose. She longed to tell everyone she knew about what she experienced in heaven, but fear kept her silent. Now, almost ten years after her first journey to heaven, she feels called to share everything that she learned and experienced with all of mankind! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 100 Things I learned in Heaven, Karen shares all of the lessons she learned from God and the angels, describes in full detail everything that she felt and saw while ascending to and in heaven, and discloses what she learned about the darkness. She believes that if everyone knew how much love and help they have in heaven and how all of heaven is just waiting for us to ask for assistance in every situation, it would change their lives forever and they would be free to live with increased hope, trust, power, and joy&lt;/p&gt;" />
