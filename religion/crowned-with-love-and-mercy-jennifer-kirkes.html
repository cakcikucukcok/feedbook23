  <title>Crowned with Love and Mercy - Jennifer Kirkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As women, we live in a culture where importance is placed on image, position, ability and
socio-economic status. The world admires such traits, and devalues the lack of them. But the world has it all wrong. We simply cannot derive our worth from these shakeable and changeable conditions. Even our pasts can keep us imprisoned from
seeing ourselves through Gods eyes and cause us to wrongly determine our worth. In this study, we will go to our unchangeable Creator God and grasp His view of us and His purpose for our lives, while releasing wrong mindsets that have kept us from moving forward. Will you accept Jesus
invitation through this study to draw near to Him and find your eternal, unshakeable worth and
identity in Him?" />
