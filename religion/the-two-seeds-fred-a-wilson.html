  <title>The Two Seeds - Fred A. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Book of Revelation (chapter 12) narrates a phenomenon that most readers will find incredible. Given a view of a period of time in Heaven, Apostle John saw and reported: &quot;Then war broke out in Heaven; Michael and his angels went forth to battle with the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought.&quot; He actually saw Archangel
Michael and His army of Angels in all out war against a dragon; and the Dragon and his Angels fought back. However, the Dragon and his Angels did not prevail: they were defeated and violently cast out of and down from Heaven: &quot;And the huge dragon was cast down and out  that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, he who is the seducer (deceiver) of all Humanity the World over; he was forced out and down to the Earth, and his angels were flung out along with him.&quot;
Further, the Warriors who vanquished this huge dragon called the Devil and Satan: &quot;And they have overcome (conquered) him by means of the blood of the Lamb and by the utterance of their testimony, for they did not love and cling to life even when faced with death [holding their lives cheap till they had to die for their witnessing].&quot; This was a War in which the armaments were the blood of the Lamb and by the utterance of their testimony This was a War of Words! This War would continue on Earth. After the Fall of Man, the War on Earth between the Two Seeds would be a War of the Spirit Beings;
fought through Human Beings, and other living things, to the detriment of those who make the wrong choices during the battles to Save the World of Man! How did it begin and how will it end? This is one question every Believer is, literally, dying to know. So did Prophet Daniel (12v8): &quot;And I heard, but I did not understand.
Then I said: O my lord, what shall be the issue and final end of these things? The issue and final end of these things become evident as we trawl through Holy Scriptures and the histories of Man, as has been attempted in the 800 pages of this book." />
