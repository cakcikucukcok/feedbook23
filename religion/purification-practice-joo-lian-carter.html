  <title>Purification Practice - Joo Lian Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purification Practice &lt;/em&gt;is woven to create realisation and awareness that may enthuse a large number of individuals to seek a deeper understanding of what they are, who they are and what is their true purpose in this world. It presents a wise and holy approach to achieving wholeness and become worthy of God&#39;s grace, to living in the Word of God. Filled with inspirations, Poems and Bible quotes, the book aims to open both the readers&#39; hearts and minds to the spiritual truths that will guide them through their journey to their ultimate God-given destiny. It is essential to have quality relationship first within ourselves and then with God and others to learn lessons to evolve our souls and spirit because happiness depends on our spiritual maturity, soul growth, faith, and holiness. It is imperative that we are spiritually conscious and realise how powerless we are against the divine power of God. The need to be empowered by the Holy Spirit and to prepare with faith and hope spiritually for that time of Christ&#39;s return is even more crucial now than ever in history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this book, readers will find enlightenment and wisdom that will allow them to purify themselves and learn how to embrace the love of God and Jesus-allowing the divine power to rule in their mind, heart and soul until eternity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
