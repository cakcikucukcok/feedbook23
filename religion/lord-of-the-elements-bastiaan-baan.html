  <title>Lord of the Elements - Bastiaan Baan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire are present in Genesis and continue to be significant throughout Christianity. Different streams of thought, such as the School of Chartres, and Celtic Christianity, have emphasised them in different ways. In this unique book, Bastiaan Baan, an experienced spiritual thinker, brings these elements together with ideas from Rudolf Steiner&#39;s anthroposophy. He considers, in particular, how elemental beings -- nature spirits -- relate to the four elements, and explores the role of elemental beings in our world. This is a fascinating and original work on the connections between Christianity and the natural world.The four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire are present in Genesis and continue to be significant throughout Christianity.
