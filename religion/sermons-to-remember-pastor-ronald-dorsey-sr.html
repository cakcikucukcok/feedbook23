  <title>Sermons to Remember - Pastor Ronald Dorsey Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long suffering and doctrine. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables (2 Tim. 4:24)
 The truth of Gods Word must be preached to this generation. Only through the preaching of the Word of God can this world be redeemed. These sermons were given by the inspiration of Gods Holy Spirit. Some sermons will uplift, and some will discipline you. To accept the Word is to accept Gods instructions. To this world, the preaching of Gods word is foolishness. A simply act of preaching on the streets is seen and viewed as a foolish thing to do for many. Some mocked the messenger, and many have mocked our savior Jesus Christ and those who followed after him. I am just Gods humble servant who wants to see many receive Jesus as Lord. Among the many I would like to see receive Jesus as Lord are my earthly family. God is my everything, and everyone deserves to know him and have a relationship with him.
My greatest achievement was choosing the Lord as my personal savior. I am very proud to say that I am a child of the King. One of my favorite scripture verses is Isaiah 40:31, But they that wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint. My favorite song is Invisible Faith by the Canton Spirituals. It is God who helps me live a prayerful, humble, anointed, and appointed life. The scripture says that the steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord (Ps. 37:23). Like John, I cried and will continue be a voice crying in the wilderness saying that the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand (Matt. 3:2). Like Isaiah, who heard the voice saying Who will go for me? And he answered and said, Hear am I, Lord send me, Ill go. And like Paul, Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended; but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching fourth unto those things which are before, I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus (Phil. 3:14)." />
