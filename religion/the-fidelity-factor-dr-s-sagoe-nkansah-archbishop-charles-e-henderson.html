  <title>The Fidelity Factor - Dr. S. Sagoe-Nkansah, Archbishop Charles E. Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many Christian pundits agree, the world is at a historic precipice and the cusp of an unprecedented move of the Holy Spirit. 
It is Gods desire that, no church, Christian fellowship, group, team, ministry or association be left behind. However, both leaders and followers within Christianity tend to overlook a crucial factor that could undermine and upend the progress of their organizations in a fundamental way. This is the depth of trustworthiness reposed within those who work, serve, and worship alongside them, as they hunger and pursue the upcoming spiritual revival.
More than three decades of working within church and leadership training outfits has taught the author, that measuring the fidelity within spiritual workers is as crucial as pursuing the vision of the organization itself. The dysfunction of unfaithfulness or infidelity is not just a marital problem, but is generally a corporate problem, affecting the attitudes of individuals towards: group goals, aspirations, dreams, visions and values. The potential for unfaithfulness hides within every corporate organization. Sometimes in the most unlikely places, such as churches, it can rear its ugly head. Confronting this issue is the responsibility of church group leaders, senior pastors, church workers and church members, who must expunge all forms of infidelity from their midst if their organizations are to survive, thrive and achieve lasting revival.
Through using specific biblical principles, The Fidelity Factor tackles the subject of corporate church fidelity from a variety of angles, empowering the reader to identify this problem and thus contribute to building stronger organizations: those that can participate in the upcoming move of God." />
