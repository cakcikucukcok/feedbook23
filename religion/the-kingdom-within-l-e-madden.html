  <title>The Kingdom Within - L E Madden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kingdom Within will change your life! The book resulted from a spiritual transformation that occured in 1989. After twenty years of practice and study a profound experience with higher reality suddenly manifested after a seven mile run near my home at that time in East Tennessee, USA. 
Suddenly my conscious awareness expanded beyond my body to include all the surroundings of the country side. I never spoke of the significance of this transformation at that time because I did not know how to put into words a spiritual realization that cant be adequately expressed in human terms. It wasnt until 1995 that the full impact of the now present awakened eternal consciousness stablilized within my being. It would have been very easy to just bath in the radiance of Gods image because His love is so fufilling yet the pressure within increased to the point in 2002 that it was time to put into words the way to the inner kingdom of eternal life. 
The book is for you! It stills the chaos in your life by showing you how to live and what wonder of wonders was placed in all humans at the time of their birth. If you are serious about the search for eternal life NOW and how to understand the ways of the world you need the message in this book!
The Kingdom Within is a book about L E Maddens spiritual transformation that occurred 1989. He spent twenty years previous to this event studying the major spiritual teachings of the world. Why wait so many years to let others know? The book tells the reason for the delay and its importance for a complex society. With forty years of spiritual depth and wisdom presented to a spiritual seeker the steps to obtain an enlightened awarness in this lifetime is now possible! Sitting in silence for several years contemplating the meaning of life the full measure of this revelation is now available for all to use. 
L E Madden has worked in management and engineering capacities for industrial manufacturing firms since 1982. Balancing spirit and business he has successfully integrated the life-changing spiritual transformation of 1989 into daily life. He presently works for a Fortune 100 company as a senior process engineer. Married since 1977 with two successful adult children, he lives near Kansas City, Missouri." />
