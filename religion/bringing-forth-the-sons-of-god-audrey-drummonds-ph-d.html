  <title>Bringing Forth the Sons of God - Audrey Drummonds  Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Jesus said, It is finished, was he just making a way for personal salvation with God, or was there a bigger picture that the church has been in the dark aboutuntil NOW? Should we expect love, peace, and joy now or just hang on till we someday get to heaven? John 14:12 says, Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.
God is opening gates with a declaration to the world that today is the day of salvation, which is the Greek word SOZO meaning: health, prosperity, wholeness, and peace.
His mansions are NOW adorned with the beauty of light. His feet are NOW walking streets of gold. Behold, the lamb has taken away the sins of the world. He is calling ALL to come and claim their inheritance set before them as the Sons of God, and to grow up in their true identity, to BE the mature in Christ.
We are being commissioned by the Holy Spirit that TODAY the Eternal Life, Love, and Light of our Heavenly Father is in our midst to be manifested.
Bringing Forth the Sons of God will bring hope and encouragement to a troubled world that we dont have to hang on till we die to receive our inheritance from the Father. 
We can NOW enter into His presence and receive our inheritance" />
