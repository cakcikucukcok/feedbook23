  <title>The Offer - Lance E. Clippinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Almost 2,000 years ago Jesus offered to Israel not only spiritual salvation, but political and physical salvation as well. This offer was made with one crucial requirement or condition, which Israel failed to meet. Just before Jesus&#39; second coming Israel will fulfill this condition and The Offer will be received. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why did Jesus conceal and try to &quot;hush up&quot; some of His miracles?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why did Jesus command the disciples to tell no one that He was the Christ?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Why was Jerusalem and its temple destroyed in 70 A.D. and will the temple be rebuilt?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Will there be a forerunner (like John the Baptist) who prepares the way for Jesus&#39; second coming?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the end times, how will the nation of Israel come to believe in Jesus?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
What will it be like for Christians to live and rule with Jesus on the earth?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These questions and many more are answered in &lt;i&gt;The Offer&lt;/I&gt;. Lance Clippinger demonstrates that if we understand what Jesus offered Israel, many of our questions about the Bible, Jesus, the time we live in, and the future of our world will be answered." />
