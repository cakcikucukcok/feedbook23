  <title>Reading Philippians after Supersessionism: Jews, Gentiles, and Covenant Identity - Christopher Zoccali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul&#39;s letter to the Philippians has often been read as one of the apostle&#39;s clearest denials of his (previous) Jewish identity in order to preempt the &quot;Judaizing&quot; tactics of false teachers who might infiltrate the congregation. But is this really the problem that Paul is confronting? And did Paul really abandon his identity as a Jew in order to &quot;know Christ&quot;? Furthermore, what should Paul&#39;s gospel converts understand about their own identity &quot;in Christ&quot;? Zoccali provides fresh answers to these questions, offering a more probable alternative to the traditional view that Christianity has replaced Judaism (supersessionism). Tracing Paul&#39;s theology in the light of social theory, Zoccali demonstrates that, for Paul, the ethnic distinction between Jew and gentile necessarily remains unabated, and the Torah continues to have a crucial role within the Christ-community as a whole. Rather than rejecting all things Jewish (or gentile), Paul seeks in this letter to more firmly establish the congregation&#39;s identity as members of God&#39;s holy, multiethnic people." />
