  <title>Reflections on the Upsides of Aging - Grace Chruch of Humble, Dr. Helen Mendes Love Msw, Pastor Scott Jones, Texas Chairman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Aging is God&#39;s gift to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as your body grows old, learn how  as a Senior member of God&#39;s Forever Family  to live the balance of your earthly life with hope, joy and purpose. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great book. Everyone over 50 years of age must read it. It contains many practical ways to live life after fifty with significance and great joy  It certainly shows that we will still count in life and can make a difference as we grow old.&lt;br /&gt;Rev. Dr. Arthur W. Davenport, &lt;br /&gt;Senior Pastor, First Church of God, Far Rockaway, New York &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Helen Mendes Loves Reflections on the Upsides of Aging is so Spiritfilled and powerful. After reading it, I am renewed in the wonder of Gods blessings to me in my many years  I have also learned through Dr. Helens sharing that I will never be too old to grow and to enjoy new ways of telling this loving God thank you! &lt;br /&gt;Paulette Meeks, &lt;br /&gt;former Daughter of Charity &lt;br /&gt;and author of &lt;em&gt;The Best For Last: One Womans Unusual Tale of Life and Love&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed this book. Dr. Mendes Loves handling of a variety of delicate subjects shows her deftness, aplomb, and confidence in her research. The chapter on sin is an exemplary treatise on a subject with sharp, jagged edges. I thank Dr. Mendes Love for speaking so freely of aging with great purpose and direction. Her scholarly, grandmotherly, sweet slap is a welcome wakeup call. &lt;br /&gt;Brett Jones, Senior Pastor, &lt;br /&gt;Grace Church of Humble, Texas &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This book will inspire the reader. The content will enrich your life  &lt;br /&gt;Marvin Powell, Retired Judge, &lt;br /&gt;Liberty County, Texas &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helen Mendes Love, author, speaker, and life coach, earned a Masters of Social Work degree from Columbia University and a doctorate from UCLA.
