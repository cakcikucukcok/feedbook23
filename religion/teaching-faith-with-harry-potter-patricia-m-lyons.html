  <title>Teaching Faith with Harry Potter - Patricia M. Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="J. K. Rowling was less obvious than C. S. Lewis or J. R. R. Tolkien in her grounding of the Harry Potter series in deeply held Christian convictions, leaving many with a strong sense that these stories are spiritual lessons but not sure how to flesh out these theological ideas for teaching, parenting, mentoring, and forming faith. The Harry Potter series stands as one compelling narrative, rooted in Rowling’s Anglican convictions of the communion of saints, the power of sacraments, the redemption of sacrificial love, and the defeat of death in the resurrection through grace.
Tricia Lyons identifies, clarifies, and systematizes the Christian themes J.K. Rowling uses throughout the series, so anyone can apply the Harry Potter universe in lifelong and life-wide formation. Readers will be able to use the book as a reference manual for using Harry Potter in preaching and formation, to integrate into the current theological season, or for book studies, sermons, bible studies, VBS content, youth groups, parish retreats, parenting classes, baptismal preparation, marriage, and confirmation." />
