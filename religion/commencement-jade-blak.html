  <title>Commencement - Jade Blak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Commencing higher through words of encouragement is the process of my spiritual journey. There was a struggle to maintain my sanity and the choices that I made; I choose life through the Word of God to discover my purpose. I decide to be a servant to others as a part of the work that has been my calling, to encourage others that whatever your present circumstance may be, there is a will to live and the freedom to find that meaning to overcome and move on. However, I found my journal as a way to express myself while avoiding conversations of my childs demise to be very therapeutic which has inspired me to write Commencement. I hope to one day share with others who have experience the lost of a loved one that they too will find strength to take one day at a time and believe in a higher power to establish a well-being.&lt;/p&gt;" />
