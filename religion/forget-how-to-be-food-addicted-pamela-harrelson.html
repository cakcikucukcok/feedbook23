  <title>Forget HOW to be Food Addicted! - Pamela Harrelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Question for You.  Do you have an addiction to dieting and an addiction to food? Pam and her husband had these strongholds for long decades, despite their love for their faith and success in other life areas. In her book, &amp;quot;Forget HOW To Be Food Addicted,&amp;quot; she shares with you her ultimate surrender in this area. She also includes chapters using experts in the field of metabolism and personal training. There is an Appendix of experts and websites that is helpful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bariatric surgery, for the morbidly obese, gives a wonderful and lengthy &amp;quot;time out&amp;quot; to regain mental stability and make physical changes. Far more patients, (than in early surgery days), take advantage of this &amp;quot;time out&amp;quot; but too many still do not. The surgery alone does not create lifetime maintenance. The surgery does give a lifetime &amp;quot;edge&amp;quot; along with new habits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pam is in a small category of Bariatric patients from the 1990&amp;#39;s who have maintained their weight loss. From 1995 she has watched historical changes in improvements and more realistic promotions of the surgery. The weight maintenance numbers have grown as clinics now teach that the surgery is only a &amp;quot;tool.&amp;quot; In her book Pam gives credit for this dramatic change to the wonderful blogging sites available to patients, authored by patients themselves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In nineteen years as a Personal Trainer Pam promoted moderation in a personal exercise regime &amp;ndash; not throwing up, passing out or crying! Pam says, &amp;quot;We would all rather play than work; one is an obligation, the other is pure joy.&amp;quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;FORGET HOW TO BE FOOD ADDICTED&amp;quot; shows readers how to recapture the joy of eating, moving and living without guilt, pain or fear. God does not condemn us, but rather uses conviction, and He never gives up on us! Be encouraged in this book that &amp;quot;God is For You!&amp;quot;" />
