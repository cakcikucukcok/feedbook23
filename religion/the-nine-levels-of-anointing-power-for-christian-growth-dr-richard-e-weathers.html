  <title>The Nine Levels of Anointing Power for Christian Growth - Dr. Richard E. Weathers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book deals with the rites of passage into adult Christian living. To pass through these powers of anointing by the Holy Spirit, all of us must take a journey from babyhood (new birth in Christ) to growing in spiritual maturity into that perfect man or woman of God (Ephesians
4:1112). This will not come overnight or quickly in our walk with the Lord; it will take time, and many will have to sacrifice the things of this world to achieve it. But it can be done by all who are willing to follow the Lord in this world. One hundred percent of us must start by passing through the first level of power that the Holy Spirit bestows upon all who believe in Christ Jesus. Everything in our lives will begin at the cross of Calvary, and from there, we will all go on a trip with the Holy Spirit that will forever change our lives every day. The Holy Spirit will become our teacher and guide (John 16:13) and, depending on how much of him we want, will determine the level of growth we achieve as Christians in this world. It will not come because of traditions of men or preachers proclaiming to have absolute truth but only by the Holy Spirit himself as he teaches and witnesses with your spirit the revelations of Gods Word that only he can give (Romans 8:16). 
I invite you to travel with me through the pages of this writing and discover the truths that are within. I take no credit for what the Holy Spirit of God has revealed; only he has the wisdom and revelations to open our eyes to his Word. And only he has the anointing power to grow us up from level to level as we progress in his knowledge and power. But here is a truth you must know: the Holy Spirit will not take you any further in spiritual growth than you are willing to allow him to (Matthew 7:11). At every level of anointing you have to pass through to grow and go on to the next level, you will have to ask of him and be willing to sacrifice what needs to be given in order to achieve it. Many who are tied up in religion and bondage to denominationalisms will try to keep you from this growth. Very few in the body of Christ will ever reach full maturity in our Lord. Most already believe that they have achieved this level because they are good Christiansthey go to Church, give their tithes, help a few people, work in the church, and say their prayers every day. Outwardly, this may seem like the perfect saint of God, but the Lord is seeking more from us to pick up our cross for him and follow him. This will require commitment, a soldout attitude, sacrifices, and even deathif thats what it takes! Twelve apostles willingly lived their lives for him and gave their lives in death. The question today is, How far do you want to grow in Christ? and Do you want to live your life for him or continue to play church on earth? 
This book will change the way you see yourself with Christ; it will help you come out of organized religion and walk with your Lord the way he meant it to be. Only the Holy Spirit can show you these things to come. I hope this book will challenge you to become the mature Christians God intends for all of us to become. 
In Christs love,
