  <title>On the Trail - Brad Curtis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA&quot;&gt;As a pastor of Mountain Top Cowboy Church I have discovered that there is little material designed specifically for cowboy churches or cowboy ministries. Although I have been in the ministry for 14 years I had never considered writing a book however the Lord had other plans. In October of 2009 I broke my leg while competing at a 40 and over bull riding which required surgery. I do not believe that it was Gods plan for me to ride a bull at the age of 46 but this book is an example that the Lord will use every situation we are in for good if we will allow Him to use us. During my time of recovery I started writing poems and short stories about my rodeo days then it turned to cowboy poetry. In the beginning it was a way to pass the time and deal with my situation.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;As I continued to write I began to relate my poems to scripture and it was then that the Lord truly began to use them to reach others.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;After sharing a few with my church I discovered that they could be a useful tool in cowboy churches and ministries or those in the western culture. This book of poems and proverbs is just another example of the Lords Grace and Mercy in my life; it is because of His love that I am On The Trail  &lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
