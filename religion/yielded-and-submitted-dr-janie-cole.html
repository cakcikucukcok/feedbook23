  <title>Yielded and Submitted - Dr. Janie Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the Current Position of the Body of Christ. This should be a Wake-up Call to the Believers of Jesus The Christ
as to the  Many Distractions of the Enemy. Satan has placed a spirit of Greed for Titles and Positions in the &quot;True&quot; Church. Rather than being Servants of the Church, and Helpers of the Church, many people want Titles and Positions. Yes, it&#39;s the CARNAL NATURE THAT WANTS TO BE SEEN AND HEARD. But if you Walk in the Spirit, You wont fulfill the Lusts of the Flesh. We are Servants one of another. &quot;He that is Great among you, let him serve. You want to be Great, then Serve!  Even the Pastor&#39;s Staff, those whom the Pastor has Licensed, Ordained, and placed His or Her Anointing upon them, often-times these people will Usurp Authority over their Leader. Some simply Refuse to Yield and Submit to their Pastors. I&#39;m speaking from My own experience now, and the experience of my Colleagues. Clearly, this is not of God. If it&#39;s not of God, then, who do you think is behind it all???  SELAH!!!  In Numbers, Chapter &quot;16&quot; You will find Moses (The First Pastor), and Aaron in a situation with Korah. Korah and others were Ordained by Moses, yet he formed a Coo against Moses and wanted to Usurp Moses&#39; Authority.  Does that sound Familiar to you? SELAH!!! God was sooo Angry that He opened the ground and caused Korah and his followers to fall underground. He didn&#39;t stop there. God sent a Fire Underground, making sure They Perished. If you have any Knowledge and Reverance of God, (He&#39;s the SAME GOD)! Do not Touch His Anointed, not even with your Mouth. I&#39;m trying to Help You Live a Long Time. Also, stay away from those that have the Audacity to put their mouths on the Man or Woman of God. I don&#39;t care how Saved You think you are, for Your own sake, You better back off of them. God was not playing then, He is not playing now. Remember, He&#39;s the Same God. It is my Hope that after you read this book, if you are one of those that are out of order (you know who you really are and where you are in the Body), It&#39;s my hope that you wake up, take this book seriously, because it is a Wake-up Call for All of us. It&#39;s my Hope that you first Repent, and go to your Leaders and Apologize, so that God will Re-establish you back in His Right Order." />
