  <title>You Choose - Russ Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You make me every single day. Some days you are unaware that I even exist, but I still get made. There are times when I am short and simple; at other times, I am a bit more drawn out and difficult. Sometimes there is pressure to make me in the midst of chaos; at other times, you get to make me in times of happiness and joy. I have the power to either land you in jail or give you ultimate victory. By doing nothing at all, you have still made me. Really, I am made at the end of a road that forks and runs off into two directions. Who am I? I am choice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to this book about choices. Whether you picked this book up at the bookstore because it looked interesting or someone you know gave it to you, I believe there is a lot for you to take away from here. I have been speaking at events and talking about choices for several years now and it is still something that drives me every day. Here is why: the choices you and I make today have the power to impact us greatly, either good or bad, in our future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In todays world, choices are made momentarily without much thought to their long-term consequences. It is the authors hope and prayer that as you read this book, you will begin to think more deeply about your decisions today and how they will affect you tomorrow. You only live once, but if you live it right, once is enough. Live your life in such a way as to make a difference in this world. Are you tired of living a certain way and want to change? How do you want to live? The good news is this: &lt;em&gt;you choose!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
