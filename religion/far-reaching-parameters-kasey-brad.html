  <title>Far Reaching Parameters - Kasey Brad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What would happen if you had an awakening? What if you had
the opportunity through a channel to speak to a guardian angel.
Or perhaps a special group of entities that travel close with you. Or
perhaps even your own higher self. What would that experience do
for you? Brad Wallis has that opportunity. Through a car accident that
awakened his higher soul and raised his frequency, he has been able
to hold extraordinary conversations with his higher group. With the
use of a channel and lots of time and patience, he has been able to
ask questions and receive answers. This book is about a collection of
conversations about parameters and perimeters for ourselves and others.
It will help open your mind to change and expansion in a very different
way. But it will also inspire you to look within and around you for your
own answers and conversations. Shall we begin the conversation? Are
you ready for the experience? We know that you are." />
