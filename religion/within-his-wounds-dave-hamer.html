  <title>Within His Wounds - Dave Hamer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within His Wounds contrasts the redemptive treasures of Jesus with popular doctrines that circumvent the message of His cross. From many prominent platforms the absolute truths of atonement are no longer primary. Humanism is ascending where Christ centered preaching has been abandoned. Worldly philosophers are filling our sacred pulpits.  Cross depleted sermons are giving counterfeit comfort to vast audiences. Hollow professions of faith are many, but genuine conversions to Christ are few! Fans are multiplying, disciples are vanishing and lost souls are perishing! Within His Wounds is a clarion call back to Calvary where Jesus suffered and died in our place. The wounds that led to His death are the wounds that lead us to His life." />
