  <title>That Look Upon Your Face - Dr. Patricia D. Ramsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In prayer, seek for a new relationship with God. Start to embrace your new relationship in God by praying and calling on him. I die daily, says Paul (1 Corinthians 15:31). A daily dying will defeat the enemy and deplete externalism in the church.
The believer in turn has a peace with God and is set free from the power of sin and death by Gods spirit (Romans 5:8). Paul then goes on and discusses the purpose of the law of God and the power of Gods spirit in the believers life, then the apostles wrestle with the question of how the Jews and the Gentiles fit into the plan of God for mankind. Paul writes about the Jewish rejection of Jesuss part of Gods plan to bring them back to Gods grace; he also believes that they will not always reject Jesus. Finally, Paul begins to write about how the Christian life should be lived in love and in relations with others, as well as your service to God. The duty of Christians to the state and to each other is realizing your conscience. He ends his letter with praise unto God." />
