  <title>In Jesus&#39; Name, I Proclaim I&#39;m Blessed Not Black - Will Traylor, ThD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I remember when Doctor Willie Traylor and his wife, Peggy, came to
Greater New Start Church in 2005. They arrived from a church across
town, Houston, called Christian Tabernacle, pastored by Dr. Richard Heard.
Dr. Traylor relayed to me that Jesus sent them to us. They said that the LORD
said He was expanding the borders of their tent. I can defi nitely attest to the
fact that the LORD has expanded their tents borders as well as Greater New
Starts borders.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One thing that JESUS put on Dr. Traylors heart to do was edit our faith
confession. Since we have joined in agreement in editing our confession,
which we confess out loud each service, we all have and are still witnessing
the manifestation of what we have been confessing in JESUSS Name. This
week we are moving into close to a half-million-dollar church property.
Therefore, I feel this is a good place to share our faith confession with the
rest of the world:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Father, we thank you that we are givers of ourselves, time, and money.
Because we are givers, YOU give and cause men to give to usgood
measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over. We are sowing
our seed into good ground; therefore we believe YOU are helping us
prosper SPIRITUALLY, PHYSICALLY, and FINANCIALLY. We thank
you, FATHER, that you increase our anointing more and more (me, my
family, and my church). Abundance in every area is your will for us, and
we choose not to settle for less. WE DECLARE that we are bearing a
hundredfold fruit, and others are seeing the manifestation of our faith.
We are wealthy in every KINGDOM AREA, in JESUS Name, amen.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Just as the LORD has used Dr. Traylor and his wife at Greater New Start, I
am sure He is also using him in this great anointed writing. I know that each
one who receives this Great Man of God will truly be blessed.
