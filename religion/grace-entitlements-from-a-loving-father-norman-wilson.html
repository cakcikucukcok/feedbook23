  <title>Grace Entitlements from a Loving Father - Norman Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In my book Grace the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, I tried to introduce the simple tenets of true grace to the many sincere Christians who were caught up in a works, treadmill-type Christianity. This second book attempts to clarify the attitudes and responsibilities that are exhibited by the grace recipient and addresses some of the available resources that assist the Christian in developing these responsibilities and attitudes. The understanding and application of grace in life matters is a lifelong process, an ever-learning experience. Both books are offered as an elementary introduction to the benefits of grace. My prayer is that the two books will help jump-start you on your own grace quest." />
