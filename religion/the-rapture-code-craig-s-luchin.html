  <title>The Rapture Code - Craig S. Luchin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Can there only be one Rapture?&lt;br&gt;
The Rapture CodePart One of anEight-Book Coded Series!&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is the first book of an Eight-Book Coded Series, concerning Christian living. Ive been a Christian for 34 yrs., and for over 30 of those years, I have tried to augment the Rapture of the Church; with additional biblical evidence. I started out all those years ago; to accomplish this one task. Well, God has greatly blessed me, in that I found notone codeconcerning the Rapture, but a coded series of eight codes total. Thus, each one relating to the Christians walking out their salvation, in one aspect or another. (Doctrinally, this first book pertains to the Rapture of the Church in a Pre-Millennial position, that promotes as true; The Seven-year Tribulation, the Millennial Reign of Jesus Christ; here on earth, the little season of Satan, and then the New Heavens and Earth.) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     What I have uncovered is a &lt;i&gt;deeper answer&lt;/i&gt;  that gives &lt;i&gt;good reasons&lt;/i&gt; for all three rapture positions, which are: Pre-, Mid-, and Post-Tribulationbeing three different raptures all &lt;i&gt;taking place during&lt;/i&gt; this 7 year time period. Thus, there being three separate raptures instead of just one. I see there arethree raptures ofthree different groups of peoples in the Tribulation Period. Instead of the one groupof the oneRapture of the Church&lt;i&gt;in only&lt;/i&gt; oneof the three rapture positions offered us. Namely, the rapture positions of: Pre-, or Mid-, or Post-Tribulation. Thus again, I see &lt;i&gt;three different raptures&lt;/i&gt; taking place as follows:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rapture of the ChurchRapture of the Two WitnessessRapture of the Elect of Israel&lt;br&gt;(Pre-Tribulation)                 (Mid-Tribulation)                      (Post-Tribulation)&lt;/center&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   
    Israel is always &lt;i&gt;the key&lt;/i&gt; to proper biblical prophecy. Without Israel in existence today as a nation; there would be no final: End Times. Israel and the Church are &lt;i&gt;separate&lt;/i&gt; in the Scriptures, and so it only makes sense (especially after seeing the evidence that I have accumulated in this book) that Israel would have its OWN rapture. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
     Further, Christians, are making the same error of judgment pertaining to Christs Rapture of the Church (seeing only one rapture); that Israel made concerning Christs First Coming. Israel, &lt;i&gt;perceived wrongly&lt;/i&gt; that there was only one Coming of Christ, which they were &lt;i&gt;sorely mistaken&lt;/i&gt;, and we now know that there are two Comings of the LORD, one 2,000 yrs. ago and one in the near future. But Christians are making the same &lt;i&gt;error in thinking&lt;/i&gt; that there is only one rapture of one major group of people: The Rapture of the Church. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When in fact, there aretwo raptures oftwo major groups of peoples, as noted above. (Note: The Two Witnesses are not a group, though, I feel, with some Scriptural evidence; that the 144,000 may go up with the Witnesses.) In which the Left Behind notion will be &lt;i&gt;proved wrong&lt;/i&gt;. Also, I have found a word pattern order &lt;i&gt;exclusive&lt;/i&gt; to the KJB, that shows forth this order in many OT verses as well as the NT. I have found the &lt;i&gt;threefold pattern&lt;/i&gt; of these three raptures in the Breastplate of the High Priest, in the Seven Feasts of Israel, in the books of Daniel and Revelation, in the books of Matthew, Mark, and Luke, and in many other places! In addition, these truths will &lt;i&gt;strengthen&lt;/i&gt; the Eternal Security of any Believer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Finally, I have discovered many new study aids for &lt;i&gt;advance studies&lt;/i&gt; that only appear in the KJB, which will &lt;i&gt;strengthen&lt;/i&gt; the Christian for the ongoing battle for the BibleThe King James Bible, in which these study aids can and will be &lt;i&gt;demonstrated&lt;/i&gt; throughout this Eight-Book Coded Series, by which these eight codes are based in Acts 3. The codes are there in this chapter; four timesin a four times overrepeating orderperfectly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
