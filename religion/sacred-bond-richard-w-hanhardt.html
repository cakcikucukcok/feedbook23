  <title>Sacred Bond - Richard W Hanhardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this extensive and vividly presented study, Mr. Hanhardt provides a model of how the spiritual life emerges at times of change and suffering in our lives. He presents a new view of ancient structures in the human psychethe relationships that are our greatest gifts and that emerge into the realm of the spiritual. This study is based upon decades of research into multiple traditions but fully relies on the description of the most powerful healing structures we have, which are found in each member of the Christian Trinity. To achieve the goal of the growth of love, the ultimate purpose of human suffering, we must invite God into the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is designed for all who are involved in the healing process and is written in a language that is both accessible to the general public and also challenging of the traditional training and practice of psychotherapists and counselors. Mr. Hanhardt also presents throughout the book many techniques and structured self-studies and meditations for healing for clients and seekers who are directing their own healing process.&lt;br /&gt;
