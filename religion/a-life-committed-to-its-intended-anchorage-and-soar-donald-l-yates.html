  <title>A Life Committed to Its Intended Anchorage and Soar - Donald L. Yates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who are we? Why are we here? What is the true meaning for our existence? Each of these questions provides a general intention to answer in this book.
Questions about the purpose of life for human beings are not new as book topics for nonfiction-category book titles. Nevertheless, author Donald L. Yates interest in approaching this and similar, parallel questions is in investigating the links, ties, connections, and other illustrations of harmony, and balance between spiritual principles in their broadest sense and sound science. With such a discovery of connectedness and agreement between science and universal spiritual principles  there are thus, the wider implications for humankinds purpose in living and for other, larger questions of humankinds behavior, actions, and existence.
Moreover, this book is poised to add a particular, significant contribution to the ongoing debate between creationism and evolutionary theory in public education. And while the central theme most recently fostering the debate has been what constitutes good science, what is alleged as being the universal consensus within the scientific community of evolution theory unqualified merit is far from being an empirically verifiable credence. It is this authors view that such an announced state of universal support for what has been described as scientific consensus on evolution theory has no basis in fact. For those who retain the literalist interpretations and beliefs of the origins of the universe as found in Genesis from the Bible, one should fine solace in the considerable evidence that this book brings to the factual basis for creationism, as the framework and foundation for the origins of the world and universe." />
