  <title>Finding Your Spiritual Balance in a Religious World: Discover Simple Christianity - Kenneth  L Weatherford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As I was to find out as an adult, reborn Christian, God is a God of gentleness, love, forgiveness, and relationship &amp;ndash; not a purveyor of bizarreness, terror, or fear of not measuring up to His expectations. He is not a god of chaos or rules. He is a God of Order and Love. Some &amp;ldquo;strange&amp;rdquo; things historically and contemporarily do happen to people who encounter God in the form of His Son Jesus, but not scary stuff (Google and read Jonathon Edwards report on the repenting and joyful people he dealt with that were overcome by the Holy Spirit in the Colonial Great Awakening.)&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But along the way, I found there were other extremes. The national media habitually presents extremist and radical &amp;ldquo;Christians&amp;rdquo; to the general public. Television series and movies (not all) present Christians as ignorant, insensitive bigots. Unfortunately, we do have religious bigots that seem to enjoy going around offending everyone they meet! So what should real Christians do? They should follow the advice of many prophetic voices over the centuries in centering their &amp;ldquo;Christianity&amp;rdquo; on Jesus, not &amp;ldquo;rabbit trails.&amp;rdquo; Christianity is not a &amp;ldquo;religion.&amp;rdquo; It is about &amp;ldquo;Jesus and Him Crucified.&amp;rdquo; 1 Corinthians 2:1-3 (NIV).&lt;/p&gt;" />
