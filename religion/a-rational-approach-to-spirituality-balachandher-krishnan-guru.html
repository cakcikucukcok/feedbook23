  <title>A Rational Approach to Spirituality - Balachandher Krishnan Guru</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When you ask someone the question Who are you? the normal response you get is their name, and then if you enquire further, they will tell you what they do for a living, where they live, etc. Unfortunately, none of these fully describe who they are. All the above descriptions relate to the physical body. Thus, the next question is Are you indeed the body? This little book is simply a guide to you discovering the answer to the above question and, in the process, discovering your true nature or self. 
This is an attempt to answer these questions by merely observing ourselves and the environment around us. It does not make or rely on any metaphysical hypothesis or assumptions. Our starting point is simply what we all perceive or experience with our senses in our daily lives. It is for this reason that this approach is described as rational. 
Remember, my friends, that only seekers discover and the discovery of ones own true nature is certainly the greatest discovery in ones life. Finally, it is my sincere wish that you find this little book useful and that you have a great journey. 
The author has been a teacher for most of his life, but in truth, he has never ceased to be a student." />
