  <title>Awakened Awareness - Sharon Althea Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2007, I began to be inspired to write inspirational messages from within. I call it the God Force
(Divine Intelligence) clearly speaking to me, instructing, teaching and clarifying our purpose; the life
we live and obstacles faced as we try to balance the inner self and external issues that affect us.
The messages are random, nudging again and again that our battles are within. As I began to
journal these messages, it was impressed upon me to share them with those are open to seeking the truth. These messages I believe are given to inspire us to consciously take control of the choices and decisions we make, which ultimately impacts the destiny we seek. Thoughts, words, sentences and phrases are given to awaken a cautious sense of awareness of the space we occupy. It has propelled me to be alert and sensitive in the way I interact with others while heightening my perception of our path in this expansive never ending universe. The God Force speaks to all of us at our various levels of consciousness. I believe that to hear clearly, we need to be still, cleansed, open and free.
This book is about the gradual awakening of that consciousness within, in it are inspirational thought that will begin to open a door to a wholesome way of thinking. It begins to connect the dots in seeing our actions and the role we play in this big thing called life. The writings are best described as divine intervention. They continue to pour through the writer who in turn felt a clear obligation to share them with those of you who are open to exploring what this means.
The intent of this book is to have you use it as a reminder of your purpose or perhaps a meditation tool in channeling your thought process toward spiritual growth and enlightenment. My hope is for you to be awakened to a deeper level of insight with the understanding that your existence is endless. Use this book to vision your role and where you fit in this expansive spiritual equation. Words expressed to aid you in facing challenges while embolden you to choose wisdom in your daily lives.
This being my first book bears a small part of what I have been given. Thank you for reading the
messages as I have received them. They are released and presented to you in the format given with no changes to its intent or meaning.
The blessings and lessons are for everyone but they are for those who see it, additional products produced by the writer such as greeting cards and posters can be accessed at www.haliencards.com." />
