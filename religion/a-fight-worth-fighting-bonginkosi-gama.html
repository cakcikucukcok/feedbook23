  <title>A Fight Worth Fighting - Bonginkosi Gama</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At what point does one begin to pursue a dream? This question has preoccupied my mind for the past two years, and hence it has ignited the inspiration to write this book about my father, who, at the very tender age of fourteen, seemed to have known what he wanted to accomplish with his life. Themba Delani Jeremiah Gama was his full name. He was born in Kwa Mafahlwane, a rural village which is 30 km away from the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) small town called Newcastle (South Africa), on12 February 1942.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout his life, he compared his life to that of Moses in the Holy Bible whose purpose was to deliver the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and lead them to the Promised Land (Canaan). Simply put, my fathers main mission in life was to deliver his family from poverty to a better life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From his whole life, I learnt the following principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Focus on the end results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sacrifice is inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Share your dream with your partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Passionately work hard towards your dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Take responsibility for your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Be honest in all your dealings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Have faith to achieve your dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Patience is rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;" />
