  <title>Time to Seek, Time to Keep - David J. Greenbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;Twenty years ago I asked a simple question which became the foundation to this book. What makah coincided with Rosh Hashanah when Yisrael was exempt from doing slave labor? That question took over two years to answer and was the first of many that followed. The search for answers that touched all facets of the question taught me to think creatively and find solutions by combining commentaries from the sages into concepts that go beyond what one person said. My experience as an accountant for an international real estate company gave me the tools to see problems often had multiple facets and solutions involved linking diverse concepts together into one comprehensive idea that needed to be presented clearly and concisely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot; /&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot;&gt;This book gives an understanding to the Torah from a new perspective. Some commentaries are simple while others are linked to other parshas and sefers. I have endeavored to write all the commentaries concisely so the reader wont be confused. This book was written because as Kli Yakar says, these ideas are too precious to lose. Time to Seek, Time to Keep will broaden your understanding of the Torah and introduce you to new ideas to ponder and consider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
