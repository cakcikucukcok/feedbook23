  <title>The Book of Stone - Moses</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt; Isaiah 42:5 Thus saith God the Lord, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein: 6 I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles; 7 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house. 8 I am the Lord: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. 9 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them&lt;/span&gt;. As the trials of this generation intensify, the Lord God will begin to do new things to get Himself glory. Those who trust Him with their lives will be prepared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One current-day man, with a spirit like Moses, is to publish what new things, and who, is to spring forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Deuteronomy 18:18 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee (Moses), and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. 19 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name I will require it of him.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The Lord Gods word to all of creation from this contemporary Moses is come: The Book Of Stone. Those whom the Lord will call, may draw a kingly sword from&lt;br&gt; &lt;br /&gt;this stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; With this spiritual sword, &lt;br /&gt; And faith in the Lord, &lt;br /&gt; Saints will overcome,&lt;br /&gt; To the glory of the Kingdom!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This books importunate message is for those in the land of the living. The judgment for the land in the west is set amidst mounting fear, The Book Of Stone is Gods light, from a man with a spirit like Moses. Spiritually, YHWH will remove the iniquity of those who seek Him. Physically, the world will witness Moses, Elijah, and the servant BRANCH,delivering believers to safety.&lt;br /&gt; The secondary message is that a Redeemer will come in a way in which none have considered. God Himself inspired the compilation of the selected scriptures herein to announce that one like unto the Son of Man will glorify God the Father once again. And we shall go rejoining...&lt;/p&gt;
