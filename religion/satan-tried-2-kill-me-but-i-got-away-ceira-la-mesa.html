  <title>Satan Tried 2 Kill Me: but I Got Away - Ceira La’Mesa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Created For His Purpose
You were created for Gods purpose not Satans
Satan comes to steal, kill, and destroy. Jesus came that you may have life and life
more abundantly.
You were created to love and be loved. Jesus is love. Love covers a multitude of sins. Let
love fl ow so that God can get the glory.
You were created to praise God. In y our storms give God the praise. Praise brings
victory no matter how long you have been praying and fasting. Gods timing is not
your timing.
Satan fi ghts against time by showing you an illusion that it will not happen. I am going
to remind you that God does answer prayers.
You were created by God to be a witness to others. Your life story is a testimony on
how good God is. Go through with joy regardless of how you feel or feeling because
what you are going through will help someone else.
