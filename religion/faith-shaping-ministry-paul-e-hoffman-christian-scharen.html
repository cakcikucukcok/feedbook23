  <title>Faith Shaping Ministry - Paul E. Hoffman, Christian Scharen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What happens after a congregation welcomes new Christians into its ministry? Building on the work of the first volume in this series, Faith Forming Faith, Paul Hoffman interprets how a congregation that intentionally practices baptism and its renewal is itself re-formed. Pastors, teachers, lay leaders, students of ministry, and people in the pew: all will find the compelling story of the ministry of Phinney Ridge Lutheran Church in Seattle, Washington--one of our nation&#39;s most secular cities--to be an inspiring and practical primer for renewal. Who would have thought? Bringing others to the waters of baptism transforms those already at home in the congregation. In fact, this intentional spiritual practice completely transforms the parish and the lives of God&#39;s people. There are new discoveries to be made in the ancient treasures of the Church as these gifts are shared with those hungering and thirsting for a place at God&#39;s table." />
