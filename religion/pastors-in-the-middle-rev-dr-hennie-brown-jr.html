  <title>Pastors in the Middle - Rev.Dr. Hennie Brown  Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book Dr. Brown explores several reasons why pastors are in the middle. He says it is not by choice but by Gods divine plan to bring churches and Pastors closer together and to confront Satans attacks on churches. He encourages Pastors and the Christian community to know that God is our present help in times of trouble and he will protect them by his power, as written in Psalm 46:1. He challenges pastors in the middle to stay strong in the Lord and continue to put their trust in God who is our strength and sustainer and continue to work together to equip our churches and communities to confront Satans attacks on churches and Pastors around the world. Pastors are in the middle because they are appointed by God to become servants, and servants are always in the middle. Dr. Brown believes that just as sheep need human shepherds to feed and guide them, Gods sheep need spiritual shepherds called pastors to feed and guide them into stronger ministry. In this book Dr. Brown digs deeper into causes why pastors are operating in the middle in their churches and uses scripture to support these premises." />
