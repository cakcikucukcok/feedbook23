  <title>Israel and the Body of Christ - Don Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At a time when the United States and Israel find themselves mired in controversy, it is important to understand how Gods chosen people, the Israelites, must remain a focal point for Christianity.
Using in-depth study of the Scriptures, Israel and the Body of Christ provides a succinct overview of the unique relationship between Israel and Christianity. Author Don Hill details the covenant made between God and Abraham
and shows how it paved the way for recognizing the promises made to Israel. It is these promises that point directly to Jesus Christ and clearly show a distinct connection between the Israelites and the Body of Christ.
Hill breaks down this essential information into an easy-to-read format perfect for those wishing to dig deeper into this connection. Hill discusses topics such as Old and New Testament interpretation, replacement theology,
fulfillment of the law through Christ, the birth of the early Church, and apostasy and religion.
As more people turn away from God and many Christians lack boldness in their faith, it is imperative for true believers to immerse themselves in the Scriptures and renew their connection to Israel. Israel and the Body of Christ is a comprehensive study guide ideal for every Christian." />
