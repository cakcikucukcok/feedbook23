      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Godfrey Morgan: A Californian Mystery&quot; is an 1882 novel by the seminal French author Jules Verne. It tells the story of the wealthy Godfrey Morgan and his department instructor, Professor T. Artelett, who set off together on an epic adventure around the world. After becoming stranded on an island in the Pacific, they work together with an African slave in order to survive. The chapters of this book include: &quot;Chapter I - In which the Reader has the Opportunity of Buying an Island in the Pacific Ocean&quot;, &quot;Chapter II - How William W. Kolderup, of San Francisco, was at Loggerheads with J. R. Taskiunar, of Stockton&quot;, &quot; Chapter III - The Conversation of Phina Hollaney and Godfrey Morgan, with a piano accompaniment&quot;, etcetera.
