  <title>The Book of Proverbs in Plain English - Frank LaRosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The Book of Proverbs is the key book in the Bible that teaches us wisdom; &quot;the single, most important thing in life we could ever achieve&quot;. If we not only read the book, but put the advice to work in our lives, we can truly become wise.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Frank realized that most people have a difficult time interpretting the Bible and never get the full understanding of what the passages are trying to get across to us. &quot;If we don&#39;t fully understand what we are reading, how can we apply the advice to our lives?&quot;, was his question. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With this in mind, he took three different Bible interpretations of the Book of Proverbs, studied each passage and rewrote them in &quot;plain English&quot;, without changing the meanings of the passages, so all could get the full understanding.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this book you will find the simplest format, easiest wording, a daily calendar guide, word index and explanations for hard to understand passages. You will have such ease reading and actually comprehending what you are reading, that you will be amazed the simplicity to interpret. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although the Book of Proverbs was written nearly 3,000 years ago, you will find how relevant these words of wisdom are in our lives today. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Prov 1:2--&quot;The purpose of these Proverbs is to teach wisdom, give instruction and perceive words of understanding.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;" />
