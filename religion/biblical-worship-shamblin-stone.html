  <title>Biblical Worship - Shamblin Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God has always had a way He wants to be worshiped. He has outlined that way for us in His written revelationthe Bible. In it, He has commanded us to worship Him with our entire being, holding nothing back. According to Jesus, this is the first and greatest commandment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons God has given us for obeying His commands to worship Him are: because of who He is, and because of what He does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worship is the biblically declared reason for mankinds existence. However, how and when we worship is just as important as the fact that we do worship. Also, what God means when He uses the biblical synonyms of the word worship is important to understand when we are trying to obtain a more complete picture of how God wants us to worship Him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biblical Worship&lt;/em&gt; is a book for every Christian, regardless of their preferred worship style or worship traditions. The fresh, new insights contained within its pages about what type of worship God desires from us all have the potential to shock you at times. At the very least, this book will cause you to never view worship the same way again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
