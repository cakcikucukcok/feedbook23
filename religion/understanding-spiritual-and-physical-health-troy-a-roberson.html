  <title>Understanding Spiritual and Physical Health - Troy A. Roberson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A healthy Christian needs to cultivate both spiritual and physical well-being. Yet often we can be so spiritual that we neglect our physical, natural selves. On the other hand, we can also be so caught up in our physical health that we may neglect working out our spiritual selves as well. So how do we find a balance? And what if God even provided us with a guide to make ourselves our very best both inside and outside? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Understanding Spiritual and Physical Health: A Biblical Perspective, author Troy A. Roberson shares his passion for fitness and health and his years of studying the Word of God to help believers learn how to be healthy both in body and in spirit. Roberson explains how the Bible is Gods guidebook for living, and in it God shows his children how their bodies and spirits are connected; this connection means that the richer we are in spirit, the more healing, health, and well-being we will have in our natural lives as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apostle John tells us, Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as they soul prospereth (3 John 2). By putting into practice the advice and suggestions for how to live a good life of health and wellness through nutrition and a godly lifestyle from a biblical perspective, you too can enjoy the blessings of Christs restoration.&lt;/p&gt;" />
