A Laymans Guide to Ecclesiastes helps you work through these and other questions the author of Ecclesiastes ponders.&lt;br /&gt;A Laymans Guide to Ecclesiastes differs from other books on Ecclesiastes. It is written from a laymans point of view; the author is an astronomer, who nevertheless has gained a deep appreciation for Ecclesiastes during his fifteen-year period of study.
