  <title>The Nursery of the Holy Spirit: Welcoming Children in Worship - Daniel R. Hyde, John D. Witvliet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Public worship is the nursery of the Holy Spirit. As you enter the sanctuary, you notice them at once. Then, as you take your seat next to a family, they are right there beside you. Throughout the ensuing service, you see them--and hear them. The presence of children in public worship is not only striking, but also increasingly strange in modern American church life. In fact, the idea of your children sitting or standing next to you during prayer, singing, or the pastor&#39;s sermon can be downright scary. This book is based in the conviction that public worship is the nursery of the Holy Spirit and that bringing children in is both beneficial and a blessing. The Nursery of the Holy Spirit offers practical advice on how to make this ideal a reality in your children&#39;s lives." />
