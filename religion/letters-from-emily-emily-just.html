  <title>Letters from Emily - Emily Just</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The reality of abuse came as a big surprise to author Emily Just. She thought it was something that happened to others, but she painfully learned otherwise. In Letters from Emily, she shares her own story of abuseand escapeand how she relied on God to help her with feelings of doubt and guilt as she forged a new way forward free from the ravages of abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide shares letters Emily writes to Angela who is struggling with an abusive marriage. Written from a Christian womans viewpoint, the correspondence shares her experience escaping abuse and gives insights from that spiritual journey. Emily tells how her faith, family, and friends were her companions, how hope energized her, and how grace made it all possible. She addresses how she asked herself a host of questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do you hurt me so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are we still married?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is a covenant promise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are my options?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will the abuse never end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designed to uplift and empower, Letters from Emily offers a refreshing look at one womans escape from the darkness of abuse to the hope and sunrise of newly found peace, joy, and blessing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
