  <title>Angel on the Ledge - Joann Ellen Sisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ANGEL ON THE LEDGE&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The created beings called angels, as outlined in the King James Version of the Holy Bible, have amazing abilities. Not being bound to time or space, they are well qualified for the missions assigned them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; During the populating of the new continent, many of the immigrants settled on the first land available, being the eastern coast facing the Atlantic Ocean, hence an immediate overcrowding occurred. This book of historical fiction follows the lives of a number of young girls who, for various reasons, find themselves without family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Angel 734 had been given the mission to transport certain young throw-away girls from the coast, where they are not appreciated, to another place where well, its all in this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In addition to the angel, the use of the Santa Fe Rail Lines and various other facilities were involved. Angel 734 was inventive, surely, and intent on fulfilling the Boss agenda. It was all well, it is too lengthy to explain here, but its all in the book. &lt;/p&gt;" />
