      <meta name="description" content="It is considered by many scholars to be part of the &quot;Pseudepigrapha&quot;, historical biblical works that are considered to be  fiction.  This stigma, prevented its inclusion in the compilation of the Holy Bible.  Its a written history of what happened in the days of Adam and Eve after they were cast out of the garden. Considered to be pseudepigraphic by some, it carries significant meaning and insight into events of that time. Its simply an account handed down by word of mouth, from generation to generation, linking the time the first human life was created to the time it was finally written down.  This version is the work of unknown Egyptians.  The lack of historical allusion makes it difficult to date the writing, however, using other pseudepigraphical works as a reference, it was probably written a few hundred years before the birth of Christ.  Parts of this version are found in the Jewish Talmud, and the Islamic Koran, showing what a vital role it played in the original literature of human wisdom." />
