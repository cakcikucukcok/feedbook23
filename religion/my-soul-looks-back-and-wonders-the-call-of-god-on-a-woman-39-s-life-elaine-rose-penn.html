  <title>My Soul Looks Back and Wonders: the Call of God on a Woman&#39;s Life - Elaine Rose Penn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;There are thousands of great women of God who were pioneers of the faith and the gospel.  Though many of their names are lost to us forever, the record of their exploits for the sake of the Kingdom are engraved in the eternal and living chronicles of heaven.  They represent the hues and colors of Gods rainbow and are present in the history of every denomination, faith and religion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Women have dug out churches, cleaned them, closed them and built them.  They were visionaries, ground-breakers, pathfinders, the bridges that brought us over, trend-setters, armor-bearers, leaders, agents for change and disciples.  They cooked, cried, sang, marched, testified, organized, did the holy dance, counseled, and prayed while everybody else slept.  They carried the &quot;work&quot; on their bare knuckles, tear drops, hips, lips and hearts.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In the pages of this delightful book filled with powerful scriptural revelation, candor, insight and instruction, &lt;B&gt;Elaine Rose Penn&lt;/B&gt; delivers a challenge to women called to the gospel ministry to be true to their femininity, and adhere to a high standard of excellence and accountability in the conduct of their service to Christ.&lt;/P&gt;" />
