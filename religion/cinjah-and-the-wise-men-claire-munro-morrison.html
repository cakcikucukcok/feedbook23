  <title>Cinjah and the Wise Men - Claire Munro Morrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt; Cinjah is a homeless waif, with no memory of mother or father, or knowledge if he were born slave or freeman, is a servant in the home of Rigel.  Lives are forever changed when the extraordinary &lt;I&gt;Light&lt;/I&gt; in the heavens is confirmed as &lt;I&gt;His Sign. &lt;/I&gt; Rigel, &lt;I&gt;The Most Honored Wise One,&lt;/I&gt; and his father, &lt;I&gt;The Truth Seeker, &lt;/I&gt;face enormous challenges as they begin preparations for their religious pilgrimage: they must evade political intrigue and deal with treachery and murder.  Young Cinjahs insatiable curiosity, quick wit and sharp tongue interject humor into the otherwise solemn events. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The Magi are bound to the Nativity for all time, yet their story is much more than the scant words allotted in the Biblical account. Tradition portrays the Magi as Kings, but in reality these men were trustees of the great secrets and knowledge of their world and held positions as Justices, Ambassadors, Governors, and Priests.  Yes, they also were Astrologers, studying the heavens. &lt;I&gt;CINJAH AND THE WISE MEN: THE JOURNEY&lt;/I&gt; is a story suitable for the entire family and offers a remarkable perspective of our mysterious and indefinable Wise Men.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;The majestic arrival of the Magis cortege, accompanied by Prince Farrah and his Royal Guard, is indeed cause for King Herod to &lt;I&gt;tremble &lt;/I&gt;and all of Jerusalem with him.  The historic journey of the Wise Men acknowledges the human condition, the promise, and the sustaining faith that catapulted them into history. &lt;/P&gt;" />
