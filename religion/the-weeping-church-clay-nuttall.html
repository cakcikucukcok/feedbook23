  <title>The Weeping Church - Clay Nuttall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Weeping Church&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was first published in 1985. It continues to be an effective tool for pastors and churches who are seeking to follow the clear teaching of scripture on the polity of the local church. Over the thirty three years in publication hundreds of letters have been received expressing gratitude for the Biblical approach taken in the book. Many of the communications stated that the material had kept their church from conflict. A local congregation that desires the blessing of God and a peaceful but effective ministry must deal with the issue of church polity. The sad truth is that much of what local churches do is simply and invention that is superimposed on the Bible. Since God only blesses what He orders this is not a light matter. For the shepherd and the sheep in the local congregation it is recommended that you read the book and let the weeping cease.&lt;/p&gt;" />
