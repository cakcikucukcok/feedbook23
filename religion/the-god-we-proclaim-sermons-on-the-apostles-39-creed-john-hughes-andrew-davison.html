  <title>The God We Proclaim: Sermons on the Apostles&#39; Creed - John Hughes, Andrew Davison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout history, Christians have found the summary of their faith in the three ancient creeds. The God We Proclaim explores that faith as it is found in the shortest of them: the Apostles&#39; Creed. The contributors are among Britain&#39;s foremost Christian communicators and teachers.   Written with an infectious enthusiasm for theology, The God We Proclaim is ideal for anyone seeking to understand the Christian faith, either individually, or in a church or student study group. It is based on a set of sermons delivered in the chapel of Jesus College, Cambridge, which surveyed the foundations of Christianity.   Dorothy L. Sayers (1893-1957) wrote in her essay &quot;The Dogma is the Drama&quot; that people assume that if churches are empty it is because preachers &quot;insist too much upon doctrine,&quot; or &quot;dull dogma&quot; as they disapprovingly call it. Sayers knew that the opposite is true. &quot;It is the neglect of dogma that makes for dullness. The Christian faith is the most exciting drama that ever staggered the imagination of man--and the dogma is the drama.&quot;" />
