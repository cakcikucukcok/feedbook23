  <title>Silent Messages - Dean Peiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all receive silent messages. You may be aware of them or you may not. Paying attention to the silent messages in my life has made a tremendous positive difference. It has helped me to be more loving with my thoughts, my words, and my actions. I now continue to go with the natural flow of life more often. This is what I want for you.&lt;p&gt; 
These words were originally written in a journal as a gift for my daughter, Leanne, and dedicated to her and her two daughters Shayna and Brianna. Eventually, I felt guided to share with others these thoughts and feelings from my own personal experiences. As they have helped to guide me along my journey, it is my hope that there may be something of value in these words for you as well." />
