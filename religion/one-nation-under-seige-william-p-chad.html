  <title>One Nation Under Seige - William P. Chad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a true story of survival and valor that was written by William P. Chad during the second part of the 20th Century A.D. He has dedicated it to his mother Makroohi. Together they emigrated to The United States of America from Lebanon at the end of WWI after been exiled from Malatya, their homeland of Western Turkey, former Armenian territories. William spent most of his adult life writing it. He did a great job in describing the WWI Era events with the accuracy and confidence of someone who was both directly involved and afflicted by them like a war correspondent. He lived through those horrific events. In his tedious work, William strived for perfection and has achieved it. Then he passed away and the work has passed on to us. 
The content of this book is a time window into WWI Era when tragedy has struck not only the Armenian but also the Greek, Nestorian and Syrian Peoples for their Christian belief. Millions have perished at the hands of Ottoman Turks and their proxies, Kurd mercenaries. It is estimated that 3.5 Million people have lost their lives during this era. These events are considered to be the first Holocaust of the 20th Century. 
Is it easy to kill, to shed blood? Hakim asked.
There is nothing to it, nothing at all. After the first kill, all the others are.
Hakim interrupted him nervously, 
I have robbed, but I have never killed, not even a sheep.&quot;
You will, the Chieftain said. 
 I will have to murder? Hakim questioned.
To kill Armenians is not murder. It is legalized execution. We Kurds are not guilty of murdering the Giaourji. We are merely the instruments performing a service. We do not slay, we execute. Is the knife that stabs the life out of a sheep guilty of murder? Enough nonsense! Now go and pass the word to our men of what we are supposed to engage in by Executive Permission: Kill, Kill, and Kill!
Hakim stood up for a second then sat down again.
How will I know a Turk from an Armenian, hah? They all dress alike Hakim insisted.
Pull their pants down; a Christian is never circumcised.
It is our hope that such tragedies can be prevented if we strive to raise the awareness of all Peoples on Earth no matter their religious belief Amen!
All truth passes through three stages: 
First it is ridiculed; second, it is violently opposed; and third, it is accepted as self-evident. 
Arthur Schopenhauer (17781860)" />
