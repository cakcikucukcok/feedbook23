  <title>No Safe Route - Robert H. Linders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;It takes a gifted speaker to turn the philosophical into the practical, the theological into themes for daily living. Author Robert H. Linders has done just that for more than thirty-five years as the pastor of St. Pauls Lutheran Church in Doylestown, Pennsylvania.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;No Safe Route&lt;/i&gt;, he shares a collection of his sermons and other essays gathered from throughout his career. For Linders, most subjects are fair game, providing spiritual guidance on everything from novels, fathers of the Church, poetry, popular movies, a visit to his college-town diner, and the current political landscape. In these sermons, the Bible and todays news sit side by side, and humor illuminates ancient biblical truths.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bob Linders addresses the concerns of living in a world that tries to do without God.&lt;/P&gt;
-Donald Mathews, former librarian and preaching instructor at Gettysburg Theological Seminary
&lt;P&gt; In the Land of Linders, Bible hermeneutics meet todays news, and memorable jokes confront philosophical wisdom in such rapid succession that one needs at least a good week of conversation at home to sort them out.&lt;/P&gt;
