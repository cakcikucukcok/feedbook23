  <title>Duh-Votions - Sue Buchanan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sue Buchanan charms audiences wherever she goes, revealing the terrible truth about herself: &quot;I may as well tell you because you&#39;ll figure it out anyway: I&#39;m not that deep. I&#39;m shallow. But I&#39;m deep for a shallow person. What I&#39;ve found out about God is that he is totally trustworthy, and I can relax in his plans. And besides that, all he wants is -- Are you ready for this? -- for me to be his person. Just be his person, for heaven&#39;s sake! All I can say to that is, Duh! Who knows? Next I may be writing a six-volume Bible commentary!&quot; Sue offers a merry and witty look at life from the &quot;shallow&quot; end of the gene pool in sixty fun devotions, sure to leave you laughing and pondering some of life&#39;s most important lessons. This very funny lady shows us all that we don&#39;t have to be &quot;deep&quot; to hear God&#39;s voice. All we have to do is listen and we&#39;ll find his message about love and redemption in even the smallest details of everyday life." />
