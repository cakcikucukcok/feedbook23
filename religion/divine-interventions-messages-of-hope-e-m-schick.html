      <meta name="description" content="E.M. Schick shares nine short stories with accompanying scriptures that illustrate how God touches lives and works in extraordinary ways to restore hope.&lt;p&gt;
E.M. Schick is a survivor. She has endured through a tornado, a divorce, and a serious health condition and, as a result, has experienced several divine interventions that validated her belief in Gods desire for intimate involvement in her life. In these personal accounts of how God has touched not only her life but the lives of those around her, she details how she found comfort in a lost crucifix, how a miraculous healing negated pending surgery, and how she discovered that Gods ways were greater than her ways.&lt;p&gt;
There comes a time in everyones life when we wonder what it would be like if we were better looking, thinner, or smarter. We may even question if we are lovable. The inspirational personal anecdotes in &lt;i&gt;Divine Interventions  Messages of Hope&lt;/i&gt; will motivate anyone to look at themselves not through mans eyes, but instead through the eyes of Godremembering that we are not alone in this earthly journey." />
