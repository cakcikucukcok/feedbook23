  <title>The Devil in Modern Eden - Tom Graneau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most people in the world believe in God, a supernatural being who created the universe and bestows nothing but benevolence on humanity. Yet daily, we experience life-threatening conditions such as crimes, disasters, accidents, and sicknesses. Does God secretly possess evil within his nature, or is there another being in the universe whose sole purpose is to inspire mayhem in people&#39;s lives?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God proclaimed that the latter is true, and his name is Satan-the Devil. He is treacherously evil, dangerously deceptive, and seeks to covertly control everything within our world. In his book, The Devil in Modern Eden, author Tom Graneau reveals how the Devil scours the earth looking for people to victimize. He is the architect behind political unrest between nations that results in war; the mastermind behind the corruption in politics, religion, and corporations; the manipulator of injustice; and the instigator of various crimes in our schools, cities, and even our homes. No one-Christian or non-Christian-is protected from his evil intentions.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Will you survive the Devil&#39;s pernicious attacks in this life and make it to heaven in the next? That depends on how well you can evade his deceptive tactics to control your destiny. The Devil in Modern Eden not only exposes Satan&#39;s diabolical schemes in our world, but also shows how you can defend yourself against the most dangerous personality in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
