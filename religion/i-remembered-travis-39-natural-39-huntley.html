  <title>I Remembered - Travis &#39;Natural&#39; Huntley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Remembered is a book of poems and content inspired from the  wisdom I  gained from my unique experiences and from my intuition within. Growing up in America as a multiracial child, I have experienced discrimination from all sides of the spectrum. I am now thankful for those experiences I strategically chose in my life to now have a vision and potential solution to todays most important issue. The intention of this book is to provide a sense of awareness that inspires the reader to love and accept thyself and others at a greater capacity. 
Although the media is persistently promoting fear, separation and division among the people. I chose to compile poems supporting love and having compassion for all life, no matter what class, gender, race or religion one may be. Regardless of what we may have been taught by our parents, culture, society, media, books and the movies watched. I Remembered is now surfacing to unite and remind humanity we are all equally divine and we all have a role to play in creating a way of life our children will thank us for later.
I Remembered, reminds humanity the importance to be at peace within, the source of love is within, we are all one interconnected web of Consciousness some refer to as GOD. Creating a foundation for everyone to live on earth in harmony beyond illusions of separation.
I invite you to say the following words and sign on the line below.
I now declare from this moment forward, I make conscious choices to grow, to learn, to expand. I now choose to be compassionate and gentle with myself as I honor my connection to nature and I now choose to love all life Beyond conditions." />
