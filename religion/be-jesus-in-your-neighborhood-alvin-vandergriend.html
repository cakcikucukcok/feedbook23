  <title>Be Jesus in Your Neighborhood - Alvin VanderGriend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Prayer . . . Care . . . Share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This simple progression can change your life! As believers, we are called to make disciples. Most of us won’t be in full time ministry, but God still calls us to minister where we are. That means our sphere of influence—our neighborhood and workplace. &lt;i&gt;Be Jesus in Your Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; will inspire you to start by praying for them . . . then you will have a heart to care for them . . . and finally gain an opportunity to share Jesus Christ with them. But it all starts with prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interact with &lt;i&gt;Be Jesus in Your Neighborhood&lt;/i&gt; for 30 days and watch what God does to your heart . . . and eventually to your neighborhood. Pray it by yourself, with your family, with a group of believers on your block; with your small group or Sunday school class, or with your congregation. Watch it turn prayer, care, share into a lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
