  <title>Companions on the Journey - Charles Robert Costello Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In brazing through the text, the author systematically travels a path he lived and taught throughout his ministry amongst the people of God.  Throughout his life he submitted his will to the Father.  Letting Go and Letting God is the main thrust of living a God centered life.  Each one of us is called to take up our cross (Each person has their individual cross).  The call to vocation and our response to it will open our hearts to the Living Water of our Lord.
In the next few pages the author describes the workings of the human brain.  He presents our remarkable resilient brain, as it is involved in our daily and moment to moment decisions.  There is an old decision:  Not to make a decision is a decision in itself.
Next, Rational and Irrational Ideas are addressed to give the reader a birds eye view an understanding and appreciation of the self.  Then steps are taken to build our sense of self and enable us to recognize those thoughts which keep us from maintaining a pure heart; they can also us under a cloud of depression and fear, if not addressed.
The author introduces a Holistic Approach to put spirituality into practice.  In this section the author uses building blocks to demonstrate for the reader the manifested issues to address in deepening ones spirituality.
In plotting out the journey, the author begins with the family in the development of spirituality.
Going deeper, a section is devoted to meditation and the prayer life.
The manuscript concludes with the section of STORIES, On which the reader can combine the stories of others and self." />
