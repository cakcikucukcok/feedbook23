  <title>Written on the Heart - Lisa Strickland Engram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;written on&lt;br /&gt;the heart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was motivated by the Holy Spirit of the Lord to write this book, for many of us who find ourselves stuck in a place of hopelessness, loneliness, hurts, pain, or despair and just need a word to bring us up and out of a place of darkness. Through my fourteen years of dealing with children from all types of backgrounds, I know that God is able to bring any adult or child through our ordeals in life. I have seen God show up and show out in the lives of many. &lt;br /&gt;Through our struggles, God will make a way; The Lord is our keeper, and he shall preserve our soul, and shall preserve us from evil. God will provide in all our situations, and make provisions for our lives. He is the light out of darkness. He is the bright and morning star. God is able to do all things; we are all born into a world of sin and shaped in iniquity, and we dont have to remain in that place of darkness, because God has given us a way out. Salvation is the way; accept God in your heart today. Ask him to forgive you of your sins. We dont have to stay where we are, but can move to where we need to be in Christ Jesus this day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
