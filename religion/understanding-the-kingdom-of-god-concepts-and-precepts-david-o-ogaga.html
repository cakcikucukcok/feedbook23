  <title>Understanding the Kingdom of God (Concepts and Precepts) - David O. Ogaga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What was Jesus main passion? What occupied the centre of his message? What did he really teach and preach? 
There was nothing more central, passion-driving, and life-consuming for Jesus than the message of the kingdom. It must be noted that things like healing and the casting out of demons were all the integral part of the message of the kingdom. Jesus never classified them as a ministry of their own. The Lords pattern in ministry reveals this: And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people (Matt. 4:23).
Jesus was teaching the message of the kingdom, declaring I am a king whose kingdom does not take its root from the social, economic, and the political structure of this world. In response to the question as to whether Jesus is a king, he admitted so by saying, To this end was I born. In other words, the only major reason why I am born is to be a king. The wise men from the East did not come looking for a child but for a king that was born. 
The famous prayer starts with Thy kingdom comethe kingdom of God can as well be described as that moral and spiritual kingdom which the God of grace is setting up in this fallen world, whose subjects consist of as many as have been brought into hearty subjection to his gracious authority, and of which his Son Jesus is the glorious head.
This book seeks to explain, explore, and provide insight into the present spiritual reality of the kingdom of God." />
