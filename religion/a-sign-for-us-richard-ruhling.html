  <title>A Sign For US - Richard Ruhling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christ linked Jerusalem&amp;#39;s destruction to signs for the end of the age in Matthew 24. Such destruction signals an impending US judgment for our moral decay as in Roe v Wade and the Supreme Court&amp;#39;s redefining of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egypt killed babies; the US has aborted 60 million innocent infants. Egypt enslaved Israel. The US has enslaved most people in some way--alcohol, tobacco, drugs that are a leading cause of death, but we call it healthcare.&amp;nbsp;, Food, fiction, gambling, greed, Hollywood, &amp;#39;music,&amp;#39; sex, perversion, TV, violence, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God judged Egypt and took Israel to a covenant by which they became His kingdom (Exod 19:5,6) and His Bride (Jer 3:14).&amp;nbsp; The apostle Paul included the Exodus in &amp;quot;all those things happened for our examples...end of the world.&amp;quot; 1Cor 10:1,11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God got an ignorant bride at Sinai that worshipped a calf 40 days later. This will not happen this time because the wedding parables have an embedded provision for a pre-nuptional agreement or covenant--7 topics that fit the 7 days of unleavened bread. Bible weddings also took a week, Gen 29:27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the wedding parables have Passover imagery and the wedding feast of Matthew 22 is the Feast of Unleavened Bread at Passover, but it&amp;#39;s not about crackers. Christ said, Beware the leaven of the Pharisees--their teachings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Church leaders have leavened the Bread, but in the end-time, the Bride of Christ will covenant to marry Christ with seven topics that have a 7-fold emphasis, like the statutes and judgments of Ezekiel 20 where they are linked to Sabbaths as a sign of God&amp;#39;s people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes, the Bride of Christ will be spared the tribulation that will engulf the world, but maybe not by a rapture. The wedding parables also offer high reward for readiness that&amp;#39;s explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christ&amp;#39;s Hebrew name, Yeshua, included the meaning of health and salvation. He could not separate them in His ministry and this book has a chapter in the appendix that some have found most worthwhile.
