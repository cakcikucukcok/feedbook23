  <title>Operating in Time and Eternity - Bishop Philip E. Nelson Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Operating in Time and Eternity&lt;/i&gt; means to function both in the physical and the spiritual realms. It is performance and transaction within both spheres: the natural and the supernaturaltime and eternity. Time is in the natural, the physical, while eternity is the supernatural, the spiritual. Time is where the physical, humanity exists and eternity is where the supernatural, God, the alpha and the omega, exists. Nothing occurs in the physical realm of our universe until it has occurred in the spiritual. What we see and hear in the physical has already happened in the spiritual.   
We are creatures of both time and eternity. Each individual is a spirit being living a physical life. When the human frame is removed from the spirit being, the spirit goes on to live for eternity. With open minds, we can journey to the place where the Spirit of God leads usand be allowed to visit with God in his abode, which we as Christians call Heaven. 
We are not accidents or some mishap of nature; and we are not mistakes, something not meant to be; we are the product of a master plan, created to operate in time and eternity. This is our destiny." />
