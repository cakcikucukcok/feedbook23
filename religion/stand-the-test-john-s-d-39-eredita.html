  <title>Stand the Test - John S. D&#39;Eredita</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A few years ago my wife of 33 years was diagnosed with breast cancer.  It was particularly aggressive and she has been gone for a few years now.  
These past few years have brought dramatic changes in my life; when this first happened it was the why her, why now, and I couldnt understand why He would do this!  I then shunned Him and church; I was tempted by the bottle.  He knew as well as I did, if I did jump in, I wasnt coming out, and did not take it up. 
Around this time words of a pastor friend sounded loud, NOW is the easiest time to run from HIM, but the best time to run to HIM.  I pray daily to do His will and to BE OBEDIENT.
I started to write prayers to Him.  I was never a writer, or even any good at writing.  He has given me this to give to others. 
I found when I ran to him His arms were already open waiting for me! Listening to that small voice when you ask anything in prayer is important, it may not be what we want to hear, however His will and our obedience to it are important, and best for us. When I was asked to do this, the small voice said this is for someone tonight!
All I want to do is His will, he knows the desires of my heart, and as I listed to that small voice I am assured He will show me them.  On the 14th of November 1970 I was saved.  As I say these things to you, I know I am a man of GOD and love Him.  As I pray to do His will daily a calm has come into my life.  I praise him for it. 
If any of these writings touch your heart, remember you are not alone, and he loves you as he has promised, Genesis 28:15, Joshua 1:5, Hebrews 13:5, Isaiah 48:10." />
