  <title>Witnesses to a Great Miracle - A. M. Deigloriam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was God&#39;s love for His creation that allowed Moses, Elijah, James, Peter, and John to unfold God&#39;s plan for all mankind. These saints were sanctified and chosen to be witnesses to the transfiguration and deity of God&#39;s only Son Jesus Christ. These witnesses were recognized and honored by God for their obedience and faithfulness. All of mankind has been richly blessed by these men of God, as they became servants of God in accomplishing many great miracles.  These specific saints were allowed to see Jesus in all His glory as He was transformed from His earthly body to the holy splendor of His heavenly body. This experience was terrifying for the apostles and was seared into their very being. From that day forward God would use the apostles James, Peter, and John in unfolding God&#39;s love and plan for all of mankind.  First Kings 19:12 reads, &quot;And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.&quot;  God spoke to Elijah and to the souls of men in a still small voice of love, grace, and mercy." />
