  <title>China Invaded by Heaven - John Waterhouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hold onto your seat as you read some of the most intriguing stories and testimonies as given by Pastor John Waterhouse as he was living in the worlds most secretive country in the world - Mainland China. The glory of God was visible with Israel in the church in the wilderness as pillars of fire and clouds. Much to Johns amazement, the fire and clouds of glory became visible and tangible, accompanied by the Pentecostal wind in churches in many cities and villages around the country. The blind saw and the deaf were made to hear by the power of the name of Jesus Christ. All the manifestations that were witnessed on the day of Pentecost nearly 2,000 years ago manifested in every meeting for nearly 16 months. Read the stories and see how Pastor John reveals this outpouring as a much needed Present Day Reality. The world is in great need of witnessing the glory of God that shines from the face of Jesus Christ and the church needs to hear what the Spirit is saying to them in our day. Pastor John believes that this book will be a launching pad for many bold Believers to launch themselves into an opportunity to experience Heaven Invading THEIR Country. Pastor John believes that its the Lords will that the church evolves into the Living Pentecostal Outpouring that He had planned it to be.
Haggai 2:9 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of hosts. (KJV)" />
