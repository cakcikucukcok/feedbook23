  <title>The Rome of Peter and Paul: A Pilgrim&#39;s Handbook to New Testament Sites in the Eternal City - Brian Schmisek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This handbook is a short guide for those who are interested in Roman sites that have something to do with the New Testament, and in particular with Peter and Paul. For more than ten years, Dr. Schmisek has led graduate ministry programs in the Eternal City. This book is informed by the questions, insights, and comments from students over those years. While not addressing each and every claimed New Testament artifact in the city of Rome, the handbook focuses on the more significant churches and locales that have a connection to Petrine and Pauline legends: places such as St. Peter&#39;s at the Vatican and St. Paul&#39;s outside the Walls are included, but also St. Peter&#39;s at Montorio and Tre Fontane.   There are two primary parts to this book: the first is a brief survey of what is known (and not known) regarding Peter and Paul&#39;s time in Rome. The various sources of Pauline and Petrine legends are included in this survey as those legends are key to interpreting many sites and their significance. The second part of the book is more akin to a tour book laid out in four subsections, generally corresponding to geographical areas of the city. This brief handbook will be a valuable guide to those who seek a greater understanding of the historical and legendary background to Petrine and Pauline sites in Rome." />
