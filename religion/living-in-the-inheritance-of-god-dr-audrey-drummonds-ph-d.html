  <title>Living in the Inheritance of God - Dr. Audrey Drummonds Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world is undergoing a spiritual awakening, but that doesnt necessarily mean everything is getting better. While some Christians are celebrating the glory of Gods teachings, others are living in a state of fear. The explosion of technology and knowledge has now opened doors that were previously closed.&lt;p&gt; 
Amid this backdrop, there are many people who have attended church and received Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, but who still feel as though something is missing. They lack peace, and are searching for answers from God.&lt;p&gt; 
To help people better understand the times, grow closer to God, and press into an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ, Audrey Drummonds founded Interior Coverings Ministry and Outreach Missions in Valrico, Fl.&lt;p&gt; 
In this guidebook, you will discover: 
How to awaken to the Christ in you; 
Who the Antichrist is; 
The importance of the Order of Melchisedec; 
What the clouds teach us; 
A lesson from Judas; 
And much more! 
Its time to lift up your voice and sing unto the Lord a new song. Open your eyes, awaken your spirit, and begin Living in the Inheritance of God." />
