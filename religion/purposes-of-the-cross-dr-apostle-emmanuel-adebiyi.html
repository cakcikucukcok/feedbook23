  <title>Purposes of the Cross - Dr. Apostle Emmanuel Adebiyi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the guests at the marriage feast at Canaan desired and
preferred the new wine provided by Christ to the old, they
were served at first, so a genuine and converted believer
desires the new life above the old, having compared the easy
yoke and the light burden of his Saviour in comparison to
the hard yoke and grievous burden of sin, the world, and
the Devil he were under in times past.
The new life must never be lived out in an old fashion or
mentality, perception, and practices, or else we are saved
but not delivered from sin, which is more or else like we are
not saved at all. I will give them a new heart, says the Lord.
The new heart is for a new life.therefore if any man be
in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away;
behold, all things are become new (2 Cor. 5: 17)." />
