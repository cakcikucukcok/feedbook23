And if He is up there listening, will He answer?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;What if there was a way you could be absolutely sure that you were right where God needed you to be for Him to act on your behalf? What if we could get to the point where we understood and believed that God wants to bless us abundantly more than we could ever ask or think?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, all of this is possible. In Keys to Answered Prayers, Vincent Dehm has come across 46 words that will change your life forever. In this book he reveals the fundamental keys to answered prayers.
