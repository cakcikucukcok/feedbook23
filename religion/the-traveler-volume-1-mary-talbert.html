  <title>The Traveler Volume 1 - Mary Talbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In reading this book you will find it to be very unique, end very different from most books you have ever read. The Traveler is a true story, of a woman whose name was celled out by the voice of God, three times. A woman who has been set apart and called out. In reading this story, it will reveal how God, step by step dwelt with her, alone the paths and journey, he set for her travel. This is the reason, this book is titled, The Traveler Volume 1. In writing this story, it will allow you to know that their are true and real people who walk the earth as a Traveler, one who go, do, and speak as God tells them to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find this book to be heart warming with great pain, end long-suffering, and in the end you will find the Prophetess to come out a winner in the end. The story of the Traveler, will touch your heart.
&lt;p&gt;Their is the light end the light is still standing and that light is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do hope this small book will be strength to all of God&#39;s people hear on this earth. I hope and pray that it will give you proof that some where on this earth, there is another traveler of God who is going through some of the same evils that has been put upon you as well. Evil, in such a manner, that we as a people cannot talk about. But see the demons in the people on these jobs, and churches, and on the streets day by day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is also a way of trying to alert God&#39;s people how these evil demonic people work through other people. And how they use other people upon you, and against you, and how they can cause people to hate you, through their powers of telepathy. Yes, they are evil. So many of you are destroyed in finances, marriages, and jobs, and you never knew how, or what hit you. Yes, you have been made to suffer, and never knew the enemy was with you in your own homes, listening to you praying aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to your telephone conversations, watching you and destroying you, from the inside of your very homes. So, we must let our words be few, and seasoned with grace. In Other words, let us be careful what we say, when we speak. Because, these evil people are there in our homes, watching us, and we cannot see them, because we are of God, and in God. Don&#39;t Fear them, but rather God in heaven, who is able to kill both body and soul in hell!&lt;/p&gt;" />
