  <title>Forward - Bogdan Kipko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Those who get unstuck, become unstoppable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel like you are stuck in your current situation? Are you living a life fueled by faith, or are you barely functioning on fumes? How do you practically get unstuck and become unstoppable? This book will tell you on every page that if you have breath in your lungs, God has a plan for your lifea plan that is far better, bigger, andimmeasurablymore than anything you have ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Jesus wants you to become unstuck, so that you can become unstoppable.In order for you to do that, the author is deeply convinced that there are four areas of your life that need to be closely examinedand skillfully investigated. In Forward, Bogdan Kipko contends that the same God who can movemountains can do even greater miraclesthrough your life. Kipko reminds us that long before we existed, Jesus created a plan for our existence. The message of Forward will make being stuck the exception (rather than the norm) and re-align us to move forward by faithfully following Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;" />
