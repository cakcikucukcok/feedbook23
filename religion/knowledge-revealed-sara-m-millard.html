      <meta name="description" content="Triunity: How to Know
That the Three Are One
GENESIS 1:1 SAYS, In the beginning God.
God is three in one. For many years, I lacked the
depth of understanding of how this could be. I accepted by faith
what I could not understand with my finite mind.
Ephesians 4:23 says, And be renewed in the spirit of your
mind.
Further study gave me a revealed knowledge of another truth
that I will tie into the trinity of God. Many a time women and
children are not mentioned in the Bible accounts. For example,
Matthew 15:38 says, And they that had eaten were five thousand,
beside the women and children.
As the husband is the head of the wife and children, his
household is a trinity. So Christ is the head of the church and
God the Father is the Godhead. The Holy Spirit is in operation
for and through the church. God the Father, Jesus the Christ,
KNOWLEDGE REVEALED 23
and the Holy Spirit work as one unit, as the family unit is one
working together.
To emphasize the above fact, wives and children belong to
the husband and are one in him.
Genesis 2:24 says, Therefore shall a man leave his father and
mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh.
Even so, we who believe in Christ as our Savior are one in body
with Him.
God the Father, Jesus Christ the son, and the Holy Spirit, are
one in the Godhead.
Regarding Triunity and further revealed knowledge: A study
of Through the Bible Study with Roper Press booklets. ** A
question I asked myself of which I was not sure of the answer
was should I write Jesus or Triunity? I simply wrote, Jesus
Tri-umphant. Just then, the Holy Spirit of God revealed to me
that Tri-umphant means the whole Godhead. Triunity, three in
one, triumphant, Glory to God!
