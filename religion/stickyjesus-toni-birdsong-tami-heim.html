      <meta name="description" content="stickyJesus is a fusion of discipleship, faith sharing, marketing, and a Get Started 101 on Twitter, Facebook and blogging. stickyJesus lays out the current day reality-the good, the bad, and the ugly-and challenges Christ followers to regain our God-given dominion on earth, which includes the Internet. With knowledge, skills, and Holy Spirit guidance, we encourage believers to dig in and learn how to navigate this online world together-and give Christ a voice in the online world. The book also includes personal testimonies. Most are from everyday people impacting others&#39; lives and culture online for Christ. These are real people and ministries (about a dozen) making a difference because they walk, talk and connect differently online. They are living out their faith before others unashamed. The authors&#39; desire is that this project will equip and empower Christ followers and get them excited about sharing their faith online." />

The book is so well written, I stayed up half the night to read it the first time. Tami Heim and Toni Birdsong have truly been anointed by the spirit as they wrote this engaging, inspiring work. I have heard Toni Birdsong speak several times and was delighted to find she had written a book.<br /><b><i>@stickyJesus: How to Live Out Your Faith Online: Toni ...</i></b> | She lives a blessed life with her husband Troy and their amazing kids Zane and Olivia. They worship at Grace Chapel in Leiper’s Fork, Tennessee, where Toni also serves as the church’s social media strategist. Tami Heim is the president and CEO of the Christian Leadership Alliance, headquartered in San Clemente, California.<br /><b><i>@stickyJesus: How to Live Out Your Faith Online by Toni ...</i></b> | This book is a great primer on social media and living your Christian life out loud online. Tami Heim &amp; Toni Birdsong cover the gamut of social networking and even a seasoned onliner learned a few new things.
