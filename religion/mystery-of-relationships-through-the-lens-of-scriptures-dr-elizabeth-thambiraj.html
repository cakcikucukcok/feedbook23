  <title>Mystery of Relationships Through the Lens of Scriptures - Dr. Elizabeth Thambiraj</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Struggles in our relationships often point to an issue only God knows. The mountains and valleys we face regarding relationships are often tiny spots to God. We can trust God because He is faithful. By trusting in His promises and understanding His unconditional love for us, it is possible to scale the unscalable and repair our relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, marriage has changed. In her book &lt;em&gt;Mystery of Relationship through the Lens of Scriptures: Marriage, Sex, and Intimacy,&lt;/em&gt; author Dr. Elizabeth Thambiraj explains those changes and the strains put on marital relationships. Despite difficulties, Elizabeth Thambiraj shows how the marriage covenant can be maintained through God. She points us to the happiness, security, self-worth, and confidence available from our Maker. Youll be reminded that fear, lust, and jealousy are not part of true love. The author also reminds us that to love someone unconditionally means to love the other person in the past, present, and in the future, even when the person disagrees with your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;On marriage she has given one of the most biblically insightful explanations of the drastic change in the marriage relationship that resulted from the Fall at Eden, and provides excellent guidance on ways that the marriage covenant can be maintained through feeding our better angels with forgiveness, understanding, patience and forbearance. If we feed our lustful tendencies, we have committed adultery long before the physical act itself.&lt;/em&gt;-Dr. Jerry L. Ogles, Presiding Bishop, Anglican Orthodox Church, Anglican Orthodox Communion Worldwide&lt;/p&gt;" />
