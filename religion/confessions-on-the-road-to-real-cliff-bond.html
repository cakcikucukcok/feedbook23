  <title>Confessions on the Road to Real - Cliff Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Being real is not easily accomplished.  Knowing what is most important, and therefore real, is also difficult to discover.  Chaplain Bond believes when people are in the midst of crisis, they can come to realize what is most real, most important, and therefore, most desired.  The stories in this book are all true and are echoes of that journey to becoming real.  Shakespeare said the question was to be or not to be.  Martin Luther King, Jr. said that a dream is what is most real, authentic, and important.  If you read these glimpses into that process, you will learn from the true authorities on becoming a real person, namely, those who are in the midst of that process.  May you be blessed on your journey as well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
