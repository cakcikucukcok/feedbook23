  <title>You Are There: Restoring Churches, People, and Places - Robert W. Campbell, Ken Wytsma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You are There: Restoring Churches, People, and Places is a pastoral conversation about creation care. It is a pastoral voice shepherding Christian people in Christian churches towards discipleship that is all the way down to the dirt. In it you will find a pastor with time to talk with you and walk with you so that the fruit of the redemption earned by Jesus&#39; life, death, and resurrection will make a real and substantial difference in your very own backyard.   This book is not actually about you; it&#39;s about us as local churches. Each local church should care about its place because the church is where God uses the gospel to restore people, and God&#39;s restored people restore both people and places. This is what we mean by creation care.   You, church, are a gathering of people defined by your faith in Jesus and the dirt you walk on. You are a people sent to that place. This is why it is good news that you are there." />
