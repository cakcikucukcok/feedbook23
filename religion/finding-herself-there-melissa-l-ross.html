  <title>Finding Herself There - Melissa L. Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Melissa L. Ross, author of&lt;em&gt;Surviving Crazy: A Roadmap to the Scars&lt;/em&gt;, continues to survive crazy in her second book,&lt;em&gt;Finding Herself There&lt;/em&gt;. When Ross depression resurfaces, she resorts to electroconvulsive therapy to reclaim her sanity. With insight and humor, she shares her experiences in hopes to help other sufferers of mental illness not to feel so alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding Herself There&lt;/em&gt;offers a narrated journey of enlightenment rather than a continuation of her previous memoir. In this second book, Ross discusses her winding road of mental illness, the ECT treatments, and self-discovery. Relaying her opinions, thoughts, feelings, and beliefs, Ross tells how her experiences continue to expand her philosophical views on life, spirituality, and religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&lt;em&gt;Finding Herself There&lt;/em&gt;, Ross presents her philosophy: We may feel like we are going around in circles in life, often ending up where we started, but we are never the same as when we began, because each experience we have, and each person we meet changes us in some way. Our journeys in life are not linear, but circular, as a winding road to truly knowing ourselves, as well as the world around us. On our journeys to finding ourselves, we also find each other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
