  <title>Got Questions? - S. Michael Houdmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone has questions. Young children ask why? Teenagers ask why not? Adults sometimes lament what if? The God who created us and who loves us has given us the answers to lifes most pressing questions in His Word. Yet many people have no idea that God has the answers and has made them available in the Bible. Whether it is a question about where we will spend eternity or how to deal with the pain of a broken relationship, you can be sure it has been asked and answered already on www.GotQuestions.org, the source for this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, many individuals and ministries who offer advice are not biblically and theologically solid. Thats why Got Questions? is crucially neededa resource that answers questions explicitly from a biblical perspective, with solid evangelical theology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written in an easy-to-understand format and organized in easy-to-follow sections, Got Questions? will help readers find the answers to the most frequently asked questions regarding spiritual matters. The questions were asked by real people struggling through real-life issues who received solid, practical answers from the Bible. The articles in this volume are compiled from the more than 3,800 frequently-asked questions on our website, which are read over 7 million times each month. Some of the articles have been translated into 150 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many books present teaching in a question-and-answer format, but few have delved into the questions that people are actually asking. Having received and answered more than 380,000 questions, Got Questions Ministries has a unique understanding of what questions are truly on peoples minds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
