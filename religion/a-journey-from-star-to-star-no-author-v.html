  <title>A Journey from Star to Star - No Author V</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is my first so perhaps a little rough around the edges, 
~ A scientifically religious and spiritual approach to our reality and how our perspective and thoughts create the environments of our social and physical humanity.
including my thesis on the evolution of the big bang and life&#39;s energy cycles through eternity.
To change your perspective is to change your life. The value of having a positive and progressive one is that the journey becomes more joyful and compassionate along the way.  Humanity creates the mental and physical environments that we all collectively coexist in thus we must individually but collectively create a proper perspective and attitude before we can effectively make change in a constantly positive and beneficial direction. 
The key to happiness and proper attitude is our personal perspective, This only you can adjust.  Compassion shown to another person is reflected back at you through karma and society.  The real battle is with ourselves.  When we can admit our own faults, we can solve the issues that affect our destination effectively and not arrogantly.  By understanding the nature of matter and creation we can logically understand the connection between things that exist in our environment.  From this knowledge of a continuous connection we can solve the problems of humanity, with Compassion, Physics, Logic, Mathematics, Philosophy, Metaphysics, and Theology in hand.  We can do this as well as keeping our Equal rights to believe in our individual Religions.  Evolution and Ecology are constantly  advancing our practical  applications in science and health.  We have and will progress relevantly to the speed at which we can discover ourselves.  Beneficial steps towards the progress of humanity and our future are continuously being made.  But at times it seems the right hand does not keep the left up to date.  This may, or may not be an intentional lack of control.  But, It is thoughtless, and slows humanities progress no matter the cause.  We should all work as a team and pass the ball around, so that everyone can enjoy the game.  If you know what I mean.~&lt;3~ 
   People Are free individuals with the freewill of choice and determination at their grasp.  If we can work together by our own choice while correcting our past errors,  Both in our human knowledge and in society.  Then this will ultimately contribute to a better future for humanity by changing our attitude towards life. The knowledge of our interconnected unity,  The living universe around us,  And those within it provide us the foundation for improving the ecology and life on Earth.  Our preservation of Nature is critical for our future and survival.  By knowing our true nature we realize that we are a part of nature and the ecology of life on earth. We then realize how important it is to reverse our current destruction of nature, and our environments. This is effectively destroying us and our future.  The duality of emotional influence and personal perspective that lie within our path during the journey is  something we all face. This is called life.  If we keep a  positive perspective within or mind then we can find the path enlightening along the way.   The energy of our conscious thought can be applied in many ways.  Memories and past experiences are just a couple. Time carries on while you are in thought.  No matter where your head is, Your body is a reflection of reality.  Time is the frequency of energy waves within our life  that creates reality.  The key is to enjoy not only the moment but the journey of life during the time you have as well." />
