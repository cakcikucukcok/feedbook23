  <title>Understanding You - Stacy-Lynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout our lives we all go through many challenging situations that have dictated our reality.  We allow ourselves to be the victim of our past which in turn creates our present and our future.  I am able to help you uncover why.  This seven step program I have designed is the same process that I have guided many individuals through including myself to help them become a leader of their own life.  This information I am sharing really is life changing.  It has helped me uncover why I view myself and others the way I do.  Why I have gone through so many challenges in my life.  It has helped me uncover all the rules I have set on myself based upon situations I have gone through.  It has answered the question so many people ask themselves, Why does this keep happening to me?  It has taught me how to truly set positive intentions in every aspect of my life, it has showed me how to truly forgive someone and let go of the pain that I buried deep down into myself.  It has opened my eyes to guidance I believed was always there, I was just not sure how or why to access it.  It has given me an entirely new perspective on myself, my life, my relationships, my job and most importantly it has given me knowledge that I just never really had before.  I truly believe you will benefit from this book which reviews each step of the process.  By reading this book you will be changing your life for the better." />
