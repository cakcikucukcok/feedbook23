  <title>The Prayer Ministry of the Church - Isaac F. Mitchell Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Isaac F. Mitchell II is the first-born son of four siblings that God gave Isaac F. Mitchell Sr. and Alma B.  Mitchell.  He was born in Bainbridge, Georgia on November 14, 1951.  In June of 1969, he graduated from Seacrest High School and in September of that year matriculated into Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida.  In December of 1973, Isaac F. Mitchell II was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Science in Industrial Arts Education.  In January of 1974, he was employed by the Palm Beach District Schools as a teacher where he continued for thirty-five years, retiring in December 2009.  Isaac was joined in Holy Matrimony to Ethel Johnson on March 23, 1974 at Mt. Zion A. M. E. Church in Mulberry, Florida.    God gave them two sons:  Isaac Floyd Mitchell III and David Matthew Mitchell.  In 1976 he matriculated into Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida and in August of 1977, he was awarded the degree of Master of Education in Administration and Supervision.   In 1984, Isaac F. Mitchell II responded to the call of God to enter the Gospel Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ.  In October of 1988, he received the Diaconate Order.  In October of 1990 he was elected and ordained an Itinerant Elder in the South Annual Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church by the Bishop Phillip Cousin and received his first pastoral appointment to serve at St. Andrews A. M. E. Church in Pelican Lake, Florida.  In the summer of 1990, Pastor Isaac F. Mitchell matriculated into the Turner Seminary of the Interdenominational Theological Center in Atlanta, Georgia.  In September of 2005, Mitchell matriculated into the Trinity Theological Seminary of South Florida.  The favor of God prevailed and the administration of the Trinity Theological Seminary accepted all of the work that had been completed at the Turner Seminary allowing the completion of the Master of Divinity and Doctorate of Theology in Biblical Studies in May of 2007.  Mitchell presently serves as Senior Pastor of New Allen Temple A.M.E. Church of Hobe Sound, Florida." />
