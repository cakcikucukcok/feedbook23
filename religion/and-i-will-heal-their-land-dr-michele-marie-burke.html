  <title>...And I Will Heal Their Land - Dr. Michele Marie Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; And I Will Heal Their Land&lt;/i&gt; is a book for such a time as this. Not only does our nation, our land, need healing, but so does the landscape of each of our individual hearts. Healing as individuals enables us to heal corporately and rise up in this time to come forth victorious. There is much to be done and much to be undone to go forward. Dr. Michele Marie Burke leads us swiftly and artfully through seven essential areas of necessary change within the body of Christ to raise up a bride fitting for His return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each chapter comes alive with vital shifts in perception and action that, if embraced, can result in a church equipped and anointed to pursue the call of destiny. We are in a time pregnant with possibility. Our potential is only limited by our vision or lack thereof. Now is the time to hear what the Spirit of the Lord would say. Now is the time to hear the clarion call to arise from our low place and stand to go forward in victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will find your heart call within these pagesa call for change, a call for hope, a call for propelling forward. For anyone who has become disillusioned with religion, &lt;i&gt; And I Will Heal Their Land&lt;/i&gt; opens the heart (and it is always a heart issue) to the reality of a deeper relationship with God by living His way. This book is insightful, sprinkled with humor, and filled with real life examples. You are sure to emerge from time spent within these pages with provision. This is a read for young and old alike, the seasoned and those just dipping their toes in the water for the first time. As we wash in the water of the Word, we come forth refreshed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
