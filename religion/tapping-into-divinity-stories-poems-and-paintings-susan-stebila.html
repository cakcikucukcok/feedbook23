  <title>Tapping Into Divinity: Stories, Poems and Paintings - Susan Stebila</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many years ago, I met a woman named Mrs. Right. She worked with a Colorado police department as a psychic detective. Her job was to help find missing children; she had a gift for this. She had just led police to a little girl, Lori, that I had been hearing about on the news. Mrs. Right told me that later in my life, I would write a book, and at 50, I would become an artist. I explained to her that I was not an artist and definitely not a writer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To my surprise, on my 50th birthday, I started to paint. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t like normal painting, I really never knew what I was going to paint. I would just put paint to canvas, forget about myself, and see what happened.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some nights, I would create as many as 18 paintings. They would be spread out all over my tiny guest cabin. I would have to tiptoe around them as they dried. The next morning, I&amp;rsquo;d throw most of them out. But, on the rare occasion, I would find a jewel to keep.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Early on in my life, I experienced a massive spiritual download, described in my story, In the Beginning and The Promise. I feel that this experience is reflected in my art, poetry, spiritual, and animal communication stories. I hope you will feel some of the magic that lies between the lines and brushstrokes in this, my first book, &amp;ldquo;Tapping Into Divinity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
