  <title>Seeking God with Butch and Boomer - Leslie Ann Engle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;BUTCH AND BOOMER are golden retrievers who love to share toys and treats, splash in the water, and make friends. In Seeking God with Butch and Boomer, childrens choir director Leslie Ann Engle shares the true escapades of her furry friends as a way to illustrate scripture and introduce biblical concepts to young children and early readers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Boomer and Butch embark on one adventure after the other, they share the good news that God is always with children whether they are afraid, lonely, happy, or sad. When Butch makes a bad choice, he teaches little ones to acknowledge mistakes to receive the gift of Gods forgiveness and love. As Boomer and Butch bounce in the waves and play hide and seek, they remind young people to always be grateful for happy moments. Through their gifts of unconditional love and zest for life, two furry friends offer reassurance to children that they too can find comfort in knowing they will never walk alone through life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking God with Butch and Boomer is a charming collection of devotions sure to inspire spirit-filled conversations with children that will help them mature in their journeys with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a wonderful devotional book. Seeking God with Butch and Boomer is carefully organized, the stories interesting and informative, and the simple prayers reinforce the lessons that you want to pass along. Constance McAllister, former senior editor of Highlights for Children, instructor for Institute of Childrens Literature&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was privileged to preview Seeking God with Butch and Boomer. The devotionals are age appropriate and engaging. I especially enjoyed opportunities for interaction between adult and child (or introspection for older kids) in each short devotional. There is good basis for discussions with the young ones with whom we have been asked to share our faith. Kathy Zimmerman, Retired Preschool Director of Tiny Treasures, Hope Lutheran Church, Friendswood, Texas&lt;br /&gt;
