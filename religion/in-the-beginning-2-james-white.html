  <title>In the Beginning 2 - James White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="About the Author and his Blessings 
The sky was so beautiful with its background of pale blues and white clouds. It was so quiet that it seemed as if time had stood still. It just did not seem possible that only a few miles away in the jungle, the war was still raging on. As I sat on the rooftop reading a western paperback, I heard a voice that seemed to say my name. I saw no one and continued to read. Again, I heard a voice, this time I looked all around and saw no one and then I looked at the sky and saw our Savior, Jesus Christ, all in white with the gold sash around his middle and he was standing in the sky with his arms outstretched, you could see the nail holes in his hands. 
As I looked upon his face I saw tears flowing down his cheeks. I looked away for I could not believe what I saw, but as I looked again Jesus Christ was still there. The tears were there as if he was taking all the suffering going on in Vietnam upon himself. Needless to say, I fell to my knees with tears flowing from my eyes. After a few moments I opened my eyes again and Jesus was gone. 
As God is my Heavenly Father, I was blessed to see his Son. I asked others if they saw, but no one had. I was doing nothing related to religion, so my question has always been ... Why me Lord? Maybe this book is the reason. 
My second Blessing occurred on December 14, 1988, at my church. I had just learned that my son David had died. The pain was so intense, it was if I had a nail in my heart. I went into the sanctuary and sat down. My grief was so great I could hardly breathe. My tears would not stop. My Pastor came to me and asked what was wrong. I told him and he said, let us pray. We did and afterwards I said I would like to be alone. After he left, I arose and knelt at the altar and cried out to God saying, You lost your Son and you know the pain, now I have lost mine, please take this pain from me. At that very instant the pain was gone and a peace came upon me. To this day I think of my son only with tears, but no pain. 
My third Blessing was more recent. My knees had been injured when I was in the Army paratroopers and I had to use crutches when the pain became unbearable. The doctors said I must have both knees replaced but I said later. Again I went to God and asked for his help and praying to him to take this pain away and immediately I got up and walked without crutches. Additional help also came from a stranger who asked if I had tried a herb compound called Glucosamine/ Chondroitin/MSM. I said no, but Ill try anything. He emphasized it must contain MSM. I take 3 tablets a day and with faith in God, I put the crutches away. 
Some would say that I am witnessing and they would be right. I want everyone in the world to know God is always there for you. You may receive an answer to your request immediately or it may come about in another way. The main thing is always have faith, read your Bible and praise God. 
The author is a retired officer who served in the United States Marine Corps and the United States Army and was medically discharged on May 1, 1972. Jim and his wife, Brenda, now resides in Broad Creek, North Carolina, where they can look upon Gods beautiful array of wondrous works displayed in his bountiful waters and glorious sunsets. Gods works are all around us. Just look, listen and hear - His Miracles - they are all around you." />
