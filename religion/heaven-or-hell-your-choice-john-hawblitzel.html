  <title>Heaven or Hell: Your Choice - John Hawblitzel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered if there is life after death or what happens after a person dies or where you might spend eternity? Is there a real hell and such a thing as Gods wrath? Is there a heaven, and what are the requirements to gain entrance to this place? Many people are being deceived to think there is no wrath of God or eternal damnation in a place called hell. This idea comes from Satan through false teachings. This book will show according to Gods Word, the Bible, Gods wrath against all sin, and the Bible says we are all sinners. It will also show Gods loving Grace and mercy for his beloved creation, man. God provides a way to avoid His eternal wrath, through his eternal redemption plan. According to Gods Word, there are two types of people, the just and the unjust. Which one are you? What is your choice? Heaven or hell. This book is about choices, either to believe God your Creator or the lies of the evil one, Satan. We will also talk about a place called heaven where Jesus is at the right hand of the Father and where all true believers will spend eternity with their Savior.&lt;/p&gt;" />
