  <title>Daybreaks Advent (Horan) - Daniel P. Horan, Ofm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Advent is a season of hopeful waiting for the light of Christ to appear at dawn after a long, cold night. It is a time of hopeful waiting as we ponder the mystery of the Incarnation, the unique and salvific way that God became with us—Emmanuel. It is a time of preparation, of renewal, of celebration that nothing can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.
This Advent and Christmas season, author Daniel P. Horan, OFM, uses the theme of &amp;ldquo;Already, Not Yet&amp;rdquo; to show you that God in Christ Jesus is always with you. For each day through the Octave of Christmas, Father Dan selects a short Scripture passage—one that is already known but not yet fully understood—and uses it as a starting point for reflecting on how our faith is already handed on to us, but not yet perfectly lived.
Advent Daybreaks provides an opportunity for prayer and reflection on the coming of our Savior, whose love, mercy, forgiveness, and redemption has already been given, but has not yet been fully realized in our lives." />
