  <title>Born Again: How to Maximize Your New Life in Christ - Ruthven Roy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book truly lives up to its name by showing how being born again can be an enjoyable, meaningful, sustainable experience to anyone who believes. It speaks with clarity and certainty about how to be a true follower of Christ without any regrets, or any desire to turn back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born-again life is not an upgrade or a transformation of our life in Adam, but a total replacement of it. This life, though expressed through our physical humanity, has not a thread of humanity in it. It is absolutely incorruptible and totally divine, because it originated directly from the incorruptible God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Many born-again Christians are failing in their walk with God because, unknowingly, they are disconnected from the very life they received from Him, while attempting to do the impossible&amp;mdash;desperately trying to make their life in Adam live for Christ. However, born-again life is not about me trying living for Christ, but totally about Christ living for me, and me surrendering to the reality of His presence and work in, and through, me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is designed to show believers&amp;mdash;new and old&amp;mdash;how to recognize and connect with the incorruptible, victorious life of Jesus within them, and how to successfully integrate and reflect the power of that life in all their daily interactions and affairs. God has created us anew in Christ Jesus to accomplish great and wonderful things in the earth, and it is time for the world to see the magnificent manifestation of the sons and daughters of God. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Certainly, this priceless, literary gem holds a lot of pleasant surprises for you. It is guaranteed to challenge your current understanding of yourself, and produce a positive, permanent change in your life. God gave you the inalienable right to become His child, through Jesus Christ, and you deserve to enjoy the full measure of that life NOW! This book will show you how." />
