  <title>The Butterfly Room - Carol Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Unplanned or unwanted events in life, particularly those involving the loss of someone or something we cherish, can leave us feeling raw and exposed. We feel fragile, as if we could be torn apart and fractured beyond repair at any moment. Friends watch helplessly as we try to make sense of what has happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you the friend or relative of someone who experienced loss, and you dont know what to do? Do you see their pain and feel terrible anguish because you are so shocked by what they are going through? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you say? What can you say? Are you scared of saying the wrong thing or making things worse? Do you not know how to help? Do you feel awkward about invading their privacy at such a difficult time? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple. Become involved. Be a friend. You may be just the perfect person at the perfect time to offer the love and support that is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Butterfly Room is Carols reflection on the sudden loss of her husband. She tells of the things that were most helpful to her, what she struggled with, and also the things that she would have preferred people had not said to her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has written this honest account in the hope that it will help you find ways to provide support and friendship to someone you love who is dealing with grief and loss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
