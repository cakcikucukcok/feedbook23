  <title>The Empty Bedroom: The Story of One Women&#39;s Loss and Spiritual Renewal - Grace Keshishyan, Ishkhan Jinbashian, Raffi Antounian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The devastation of losing a child never quite goes away.No matter how many years separate us from the tragedy, the&amp;nbsp;heartache always looms, often returning in waves,&amp;nbsp;to crush&amp;nbsp;and paralyze us once more. Yet at some point in the sustained&amp;nbsp;nightmare of grappling with the sense of pointlessness&amp;nbsp;that accompanies inconsolable grief, something seems&amp;nbsp;to click faintly inside: ever so slowly, and at first with great&amp;nbsp;hesitation, we seem to stumble on a source of strength to&amp;nbsp;embrace another day,and to broaden our horizon in order&amp;nbsp;to find a slightly, perhaps even significantly, recalibrated&amp;nbsp;purpose in the special occasion that&amp;rsquo;s life.&amp;nbsp;This improbable&amp;nbsp;breakthrough, this renewed daring to see life as a special gift&amp;nbsp;worth celebrating, despite our ever-painful awareness that it&amp;nbsp;was snatched away from our own child, may well be the key&amp;nbsp;to a process of healing. Grief forces us to question our values, priorities, and&amp;nbsp;goals. It compels us to reevaluate our lives. After my son&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;death, I was gripped by confusion and doubt. I began to&amp;nbsp;question my faith and sought solitude, deliberately disconnecting&amp;nbsp;myself from the world.&amp;nbsp;I had locked myself in complete despair. I thought there&amp;nbsp;was no way out.Yet what I could not possibly fathom in that depth of&amp;nbsp;despair was the fact that the human spirit is malleable to&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;inconceivable degree, with a built-in survival mechanism&amp;nbsp;which can not only help us cope with adversity, but enable&amp;nbsp;us to perceive a given situation through a fresh lens, in effect&amp;nbsp;empowering us to transform our reality.It took time...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I slowly but surely began&amp;nbsp;to emerge from the darkness.The breakthrough, almost&amp;nbsp;a Eureka moment,&amp;nbsp;came in the form of the realization that in&amp;nbsp;fact my hand had always&amp;nbsp;been held by a universal power &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;that which we might call God; that which I knew to be God.&amp;nbsp;God is everywhere. He is the universe. He is in the&amp;nbsp;mountains I hike, the air I breathe, the people I say hello and&amp;nbsp;goodbye to. He is in the things I don&amp;rsquo;t see with my own eyes,&amp;nbsp;in dimensions that the human mind cannot comprehend&amp;nbsp;yet. He is the energy, love, and life force behind everything&amp;hellip;from sunrise to sunset.&amp;nbsp;The process of perceiving the world anew also had unexpected&amp;nbsp;concomitants. In my dreams, my son showed me&amp;nbsp;where he was affording me glimpses of what we might refer&amp;nbsp;to as the afterlife. I know he is no longer in the material&amp;nbsp;world, but I&amp;rsquo;m also certain that he is in a dimension we&amp;nbsp;know nothing about. I am convinced of this because I was&amp;nbsp;there with him. As significantly, there have been numerous&amp;nbsp;instances where I have felt my son&amp;rsquo;s presence in a form of energy&amp;nbsp;that surrounds me. It has felt as though he was hugging&amp;nbsp;me with his energy. I acknowledge and accept these experiences,&amp;nbsp;given their indisputable realness, their palpability. I&amp;nbsp;know they are my son&amp;rsquo;s way of communicating and saying,&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Here I am, mom, still around&amp;hellip; giving you a sign that there&amp;nbsp;is an afterlife and it is wonderful!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
