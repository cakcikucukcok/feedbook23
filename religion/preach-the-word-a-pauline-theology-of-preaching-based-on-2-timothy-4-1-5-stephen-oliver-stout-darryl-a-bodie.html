  <title>Preach the Word: A Pauline Theology of Preaching Based on 2 Timothy 4:1-5 - Stephen Oliver Stout, Darryl A. Bodie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At some time or another, every preacher has entered the pulpit wondering &quot;What shall I preach?&quot; This study finds the answer in the preaching charge of 2 Timothy 4:1-5 summarized in the command, &quot;Preach the Word!&quot; In this careful examination of the preaching ministry of Paul as recorded in his letters and sermons in the book of Acts, a Pauline theology of preaching emerges.  What this work discovers is that the governing activity of the ministry of the Apostle Paul is the verbal proclamation of the gospel of Christ. All other activities in his ministry are subservient to this overriding concern, and they find meaning only if preaching is primary. That being the case, this book takes seriously the words of Paul when he encourages future preachers to follow his teaching, conduct, and purpose (2 Tim 3:10), offering Paul as the model for the Christian preacher. As readers will discover, anyone who desires to preach biblically should seek to preach like Paul, and the way to do that is to &quot;Preach the Word!&quot;" />
