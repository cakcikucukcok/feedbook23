  <title>Sticks and Stones - Ace Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Of the roughly thirty-thousand words you will speak today, imagine if just a handful of them could save a life … … or heal a broken heart … or inspire a vision that would shape the course of history.

With simple action points and colorful stories, this inspiring book will help you weed out sticks-and-stones negativism and unleash the surpassing, life-giving, destiny-shaping power of positive words. What does it take for your words to make a difference? Perhaps a simple thank-you letter. Maybe an encouraging email. Or a simple hello, a thoughtful phone call, a note written on the back of a family photograph … the possibilities are endless. Sticks and Stones shows you the power and importance of your words, and how to use the right words to have a positive impact beyond anything you can imagine.&lt;/P&gt;" />
