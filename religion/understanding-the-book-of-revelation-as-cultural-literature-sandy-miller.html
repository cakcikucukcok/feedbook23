  <title>Understanding the Book of Revelation as Cultural Literature - Sandy Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the book of Revelation, John offers a peek at the steady march of society toward Christs kingdom on earth. Exotic language, symbols, and caricatures of the actors on the stage during Johns life provide a study in the intolerable politics of the Roman Empire, which was in power during the life of Christ and of John, his disciple.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Author Sandy Millers &lt;i&gt;Understanding the Book of Revelation as Cultural Literature&lt;/i&gt; brings a new and different perspective to this important biblical book. She considers such questions as what the vision says about the God John worships, and if Johns God is just, why he delays justice for those martyred for their faith. When the seventh angel trumpets the time for God to destroy those who destroy the earth(Rev. 11:18d), there are no bloody victims in Johns Armageddon. The only weapon used is the Sword of Truth. Christs white robe is stained with the blood of his own self-sacrifice. His armys battle garb is clean and white. This war is differenta battle for the hearts and minds of menfought daily by Christ and his army of truth tellers. Martyrs find comfort when the destroyers hearts are changed, but if they still need a sacrifice, justice demands they sacrifice themselves.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Understanding the Book of Revelation as Cultural Literature&lt;/i&gt; provides guidelines to help you and your students to understand what some may find complicated. Most importantly, a better understanding of this book in particular can lead to a better understanding of the Bible and God as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;" />
