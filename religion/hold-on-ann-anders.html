  <title>Hold On - Ann Anders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about a young woman that God chooses to go up against Klans, who are people in high places. God chose her because he knew that she had courage. This book talks about the many trials she went through from Franklinton, La to Baton Rouge, la, to New Orleans, La, and back to Franklinton, La. 
	Her mother said that God was using her for something bigger than Franklinton, La. She could not believe what He was using her for. She mentions in her book that God showed her in a vision that she was killing and eating big anaconda snakes and then she saw herself pulling pins out of her mouth. Then she saw a big bus coming her way in her spirit. She knew it could be charges, then she came out with the victory. The pins she mentioned coming out of her mouth was things she was saying that was hurting her relationship with God. She writes that 911 happened because Bush knew that he could loose his Presidency if the world found out he was Klan and that he allowed FBI to harass her along with others in conspiracy. She also writes that Bush allowed 911 so he could come up with terrorist who she believe rooted from Klans!" />
