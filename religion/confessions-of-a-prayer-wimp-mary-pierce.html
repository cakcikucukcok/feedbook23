  <title>Confessions of a Prayer Wimp - Mary Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is your spiritual life more like a fast-food run than an intimate dinner for two?Whether it’s the busy mother’s wish to be Wonder Woman—minus the metal bra—or battles with an exploding hot water heater, or fighting the “Resolutionary War” of New Year’s Day, Mary Pierce understands the dilemmas of being a woman in today’s 24/7 world. From disorganized misery to extreme organizational mania (she used to refer to her children by their household chores: Cat Box Boy, Dishwasher Girl, and Garbage Can Baby), Pierce deals with our fumbling attempts to grow closer to God, encouraging us as she invites us to laugh, cry, love, embrace life, and pray!In her humorous, conversational style, Pierce laughs at her mistakes and her prayers that seem more like advertising jingles (Lord, I need a break today, and Can you hear me now, Lord?). In Confessions of a Prayer Wimp, you’ll come to understand that faith is less about what you are or do or say, and more about who God is—someone who loves you no matter what you do." />
