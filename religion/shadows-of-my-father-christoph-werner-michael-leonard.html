  <title>Shadows of My Father - Christoph Werner, Michael Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In celebration of the 500th anniversary of the Reformation, an enthralling and original novel that brings to life one of Christianity&#39;s most significant figures, Martin Luther, and the tumultuous world of late medieval Germany that shaped&amp;#8212;and was reshaped by&amp;#8212;him, told through the fictional letters and diary entries of his youngest son, Paul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the shadow of his strict and pious father, Paul Luther rejected Martin&amp;#8217;s singular devotion. Unwilling to join his father&#39;s fanatical disciples, Paul became critical of his famous father&#39;s critiques, and instead turned his interest and intellect to science and medicine. Yet Martin Luther remained a presence that haunted Paul&amp;#8217;s life and transformed his world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadows of My Father&lt;/em&gt; paints a vivid and atmospheric picture of Martin Luther, including his day-to-day life, his break with the Catholic Church, and his singular dedication in sustaining the Reformation. It is also a portrait of a rebellious son raised in a harsh religious household who turns his faith to saving lives instead of souls, eventually becoming a royal doctor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christoph Werner vividly recreates the world of sixteenth-century Germany, a time of wars and famines when a Kaiser battles to keep an empire together, and faith and tradition clash with education and reason&amp;#8212;giving birth to superstition and shaking the foundations of a Catholic Church already riven by internal conflict. A thoughtful, insightful lens into one of the most famous figures, one of the most profound historical events, and one of the most turbulent periods in our past, &lt;em&gt;Shadows of My Father&lt;/em&gt; reveals an intriguing, historically accurate, and all-too-human side of Martin Luther and his lasting legacy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
