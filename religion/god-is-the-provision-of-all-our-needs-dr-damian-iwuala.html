  <title>God Is the Provision of All Our Needs - Dr. Damian Iwuala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This powerful book shares profound scriptural insights on the power of God and how He was the provision of all our needs. Gods provision is not about us, it is about Him and His work. God wants His children to be blessed and healed, with every need met, live a live full of more abundantly and have prosperity with a purpose. God promise to provide all our needs if He has not provided it, then we dont need it. We should realize that our true need is God Himself. God is on a mission of restoration and remodeling our mind. It is my sincere desire that this book will serve for inspiration and confirmation to those who read them. Let us live our lives today as we will live in eternity, focusing on God as our Light, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Provision and Provider. God gave us His Son, Spirit, Love, Gift and Free will and provides us with the divine principle for living a victorious life. He gave us all the basic tools which are His words and the truths contained in the Bible have the supernatural ability to change and transform us to be the person that God wants you to become in Him. This book will help you develop and apply biblical principles to our lives and also shares insights that will help readers adjust to the many challenges and changes that life brings. The most important thing in achieving your road to victory is your will power, attitude, dedication, passion, commitment, and refusal to surrender. Cultivate positive thinking for the right reason to enhance the quality of your life and the lives of others. We can frame our world; change our circumstances through the power of Gods word. The key to overcoming challenges and problems and have victory is to see them from God proper perspective. This book will guide us into discovering Gods plan by renewing our mind, demonstrating accountability, self-discipline, and good conduct. What you are doing today always effects where you will be tomorrow, therefore we should pay attention to our action today! Our character, behavior and attitude shape us to know God and allow our children to learn more about God which help them to develop spiritual knowledge that help to enquire wisdom, discipline and instruction necessary for godly living. The right habits create the right destiny. The best way to predict the future is to create it. Your life has a divine purpose and destiny. The quality of your works is the reflections of your character. Faith in God opens the doors to favor. Where there is no vision, the people perish. This book will challenge your mind to embrace changes and responsibility and the greatness God has put within you. May Gods grace and mercy be poured out on anyone that reads this book? May the Holy Spirit inspire us? All these blessings shall come upon you and overtake you, because you obey the voice of the Lord your God (Deuteronomy 28:2). I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. My God shall supply all your need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus (Philippians 4:13, 19)." />
