  <title>He Calls Me Friend - Carrie Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst. John 6:35&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wished you had a recipe for the Christian life you could whip up with results pleasing to God? You know, one of those step one  step two  now add to  recipes? Well, there is! The Lord has, through the apostle Peter in his letters to the church, given to each person a step-by-step recipe; He even supplies the key ingredients. Jesus offers you the Bread of Life and the gift of faith to receive it. That gift of salvation and faith starts you off on the right track and keeps you there if you remember to stir it (2 Tim. 1:6).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In He Calls Me Friend, I draw on the custom of offering friendship bread to new neighbors to explain the spiritual truths found in 2 Peter 1. Just as in the physical recipe of friendship bread, the startera key ingredient supplied by the potential friendis vital; you cannot go any further without it. The apostle Peter outlines three things Jesus gives to each new Christian: grace, faith, and precious promises. These make up the starter for the spiritual recipe. Peter encourages you the believer to add to this virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and last but not least, charity. These seven ingredients make up the rest of the recipe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New believers will benefit from this step-by-step outline of what being a true friend of Christ involves. The book will also encourage women of any age group who are established in the faith to grow spiritually stronger. Following the recipe with care, they will be able to not only serve the sweet bread of heaven in their own home but have enough to share with neighbors they meet along the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
