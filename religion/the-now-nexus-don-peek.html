&lt;p&gt;The new-age revolutionthe spirit of truth is leading a new revolution against absurdity, and it is really new. Around the world, powerful and influential new-age believers are being called to wake up to the truth of Jesus Christ. Many who have traditionally abstained from professing their faith are now being made fully conscious of Gods presence in their lives. New-age believers are uniquely prepared to connect the world through faith, business, and culture. The very soul of the new-age movement is now being leveraged in favor of Christ. No longer confined by synthetic ideology, new-age believers can now break down barriers and stereotypes in our society that others simply cannot. We are all called to serve; it is our purpose for being here now.
