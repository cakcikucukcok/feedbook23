  <title>A Gateway to Higher Consciousness - Don Marr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Surprise, February 1, 1991 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What would you do if one night while you were sleeping, you were suddenly awakened and you noticed that your left hand was moving without your help? Ideas were flowing through you and being written by your left hand. You ask what&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;s going on and you are told that this process is voluntary and can be stopped at any time. What would you do? Would you panic or would you experiment with it and see what you got? 
&lt;P&gt;In 1991, this actual experience happened to businessman Don Marr. He had no previous experience as a writer and no affiliation with any religious organization. For several months, he was awakened exactly at 3:30 A.M. and the process continued. This information seemed other worldly or of a spiritual nature. As he compiled this information, he organized it into several essays. Each one answered a specific question man has always wondered about. 
&lt;P&gt;What questions do you have? 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This information may answer many questions you have about life or may raise more questions. Have you ever asked who you were? What is Love? What is God&#39;&#39;s will for me? You may be surprised by the answers Don received. 
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These middle-of-the-night experiences have resulted in three books. The first, A Gateway To Higher Consciousness, is a formula or guide to assist you in accessing your higher self or soul for direct communication. Following this information, Don then co-created a second book, My Father Calls Me (One Man&#39;&#39;s Way Back To God). This was followed by a third book, called The Embodiment of God as a Whole(Being AT-1).
