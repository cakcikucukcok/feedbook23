  <title>Origin - Christian Eibelshauser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is there a purpose to life?&lt;br&gt;
Is there a higher power? &lt;br&gt;
Is there an eternity? &lt;br&gt;
How can our lives be more fulfi lling? &lt;br&gt;
How do all the pieces fi t together? &lt;br&gt;
What is the nature of the universe? &lt;br&gt;
Where does all this star stuff come from? &lt;br&gt;
What is the origin of the universe? &lt;br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Curiosity of the author, Christian Eibelshauser, compelled him to search for the answers to some of lifes most enduring questions. Now his astonishing findings are revealed in - ORIGIN : A Journey Of Discovery&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The power behind the universe  what he calls the infi nite totality  is present in every part of the universe. In fact, it is the universe. As such, the infinite totality is present in each individual and is known as the cosmic being (traditionally called a soul or intuition). He believes that the reason so many have failed at finding true happiness in their lives is because they have fallen out of touch with their personal cosmic being.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But there is hope.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To become reacquainted with your cosmic being, you must begin consciously examining your Everyday actions and beliefs, in an effort to get rid of outdated patterns of living and thinking.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;He also explores the creation of the universe from a scientifi c standpoint. Using physics, the author shows that, on its most basic level, all matter is made up from nothing more than energy (with an in-depth explanation of the term energy). Therefore, the universe is the infi nite totality  or energy  itself. Finally, the author presents a new and totally revolutionary model of the universe, hitherto neither contemplated nor depicted.&lt;/P&gt;" />
