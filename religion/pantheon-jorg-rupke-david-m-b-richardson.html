  <title>Pantheon - Jorg Rupke, David M. B. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From one of the world&#39;s leading authorities on the subject, an innovative and comprehensive account of religion in the ancient Roman and Mediterranean world&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this ambitious and authoritative book, J&amp;#246;rg R&amp;#252;pke provides a comprehensive and strikingly original narrative history of ancient Roman and Mediterranean religion over more than a millennium&amp;#8212;from the late Bronze Age through the Roman imperial period and up to full-fledged Christianization. While focused primarily on the city of Rome, &lt;i&gt;Pantheon&lt;/i&gt; fully integrates the many religious traditions found in the Mediterranean world, including Judaism and Christianity. This generously illustrated book is also distinguished by its unique emphasis on &amp;#8220;lived religion,&amp;#8221; a perspective that stresses how individuals&amp;#8217; experiences and practices transform religion into something different from its official form. The result is a radically new picture of both Roman religion and a crucial period in Western religion&amp;#8212;one that influenced Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and even the modern idea of &amp;#8220;religion&amp;#8221; itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on a vast range of literary and archaeological evidence, &lt;i&gt;Pantheon&lt;/i&gt; shows how Roman religion shaped and was shaped by its changing historical contexts from the ninth century BCE to the fourth century CE. Because religion was not a distinct sphere in the Roman world, the book treats religion as inseparable from developments in political, social, economic, and cultural life. The narrative emphasizes the diversity of Roman religion, offers a new view of central concepts such as &amp;#8220;temple,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;altar,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;votive,&amp;#8221; reassesses the gendering of religious practices, and much more. Throughout, &lt;i&gt;Pantheon &lt;/i&gt;draws on the insights of modern religious studies, but without &amp;#8220;modernizing&amp;#8221; ancient religion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its unprecedented scope and innovative approach, &lt;i&gt;Pantheon&lt;/i&gt; is anunparalleled account of ancient Roman and Mediterranean religion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
