  <title>Pruned to Be Fruitful - Jacinth M. Dunkley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living a life of great expectation and spending quality time in the Word of God will open our hearts and minds to the supernatural things that God has in store for each of His children. When we open our hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ, the Devil will view us as a threat, and then he will do everything in his power to destroy us. Many think this is the end of all our troubles, and in a sense this is true, for we dont have to carry the heavy burdens any more. The Bible tells us the battles belong to the Lord; we have seen how God fought for the patriots, and He is the same God today, for He never changes; He will do the same for us. 
This book was written to encourage everyone faced with any form of difficulty and having a desire to grow spiritually. The testimonies shared are experiences we will face at some time in our lives. It is not the amount of trials we overcome that matters; it is the way in which we overcome these trials that reflects who we are as Christians. 
I reflect back to when Jesus was led into the wilderness to be tempted by the Devil. Having all power given unto Him to do what is right, Jesus Christ remain humbled, speaking only the Word of God. The Bible teaches that the Word of God is powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, but unless you have had a personal experience with it, the powerful effect of Gods word will remain unknown to you. 
The inspiration written in this book will enhance your spiritual walk and prepare you for advanced growth. If you are walking in spiritual deficit, be encouraged, for it will be over by the time you finish reading this book. I have seen too many victories to let fear, doubt, and defeat have the last word. God is ablemore than able. Turn the pages, and find out for yourself!" />
