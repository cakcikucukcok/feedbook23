  <title>Back with the Living - Larry Heth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After many efforts to end his dependency on drugs and alcohol, Larry managed to find success through a twelve-step program and full surrender to his Lord and Savior. Upon his release from a life of sin, God let him know He wanted Larry to share his story. Though he is no one famous or important, his story is worth telling. The love and forgiveness of a God who refused to abandon him is something everyone needs to know.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
God blessed Larry with a wife who gives him the love that was so woefully lacking earlier in his life. Larry and Nancy have been married for more than seven years, and live in Kenosha, Wisconsin. His passions include sports, fishing, and enjoying his life as a Christian. He is active in church as an usher and in many other positions where his experience is needed. He enjoys writing about any topic God lays on his heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
