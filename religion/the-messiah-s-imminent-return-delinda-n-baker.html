  <title>The Messiah’S Imminent Return - DeLinda N. Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout both the Old and New Testament, there are numerous prophecies pointing to the return of the Messiah in power and glory. In the early church, a prevailing message was Jesuss promise to return in the clouds. The knowledge that the Messiah would someday return and deliver Israel and the saints from the evils of this world has been a tremendous source of encouragement over the ages. The questions have been and continue to be, When will Jesus return? Have the signs of his return been fulfilled? Is the Messiahs return imminent? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, we will explore the scriptures that outline the signs that will precede the return of Jesus Christ in power and glory. In addition to looking at scriptures on the topic, we will look at current and historical events that may be significant. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also, we will ask how this impacts Christians and how we should respond. In Matthew 25, Jesus tells a parable of a bridegroom and ten virgins. The bridegrooms return was delayed so that the wedding party became drowsy and fell asleep. When he returned late in the night, only those who were ready went with him to the wedding feast. The others were left behind. As Christians, we need to be ready for Jesuss return. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Come prepared to dig deep into scriptures and look forward to Jesuss return!&lt;/p&gt;" />
