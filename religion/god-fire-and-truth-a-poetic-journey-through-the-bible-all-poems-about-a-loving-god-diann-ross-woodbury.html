  <title>God, Fire and Truth: a Poetic Journey Through the Bible, All Poems About a Loving God - Diann Ross Woodbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GOD, FIRE AND TRUTH
A POETIC JOURNEY THROUGH THE BIBLE 
This is a book about the bible written all in poetry. Each
and every book of the Bible is in this book with a few of my
own poems not based upon the book that I read to get the
major poems about the most important parts of the Bible. If
you like the Psalms but find the other parts of the Bible a bit
confusing, then this is a book that will help you understand
the Bible better.
We have a loving, but just God. You wouldnt let your child
run wild in the traffic of the streets would you? Well God
sets down rules so that we can be safe and get through this
sometimes hard world. He does it because He loves us!
I hope this book will give you hours of enjoyment.
I know I learned a lot from writing it that I did not know
from reading the actual Bible. Nothing can surpass the actual
Bible, but for some, you may find this book to be rather fun.
The poems were written from reading a small book about the
most important parts of each book of the Bible.
God bless you, Diann Ross Woodbury" />
