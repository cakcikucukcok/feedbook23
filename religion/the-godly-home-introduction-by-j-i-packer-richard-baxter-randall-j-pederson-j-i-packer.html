  <title>The Godly Home (Introduction by J. I. Packer) - Richard Baxter, Randall J. Pederson, J. I. Packer</title>

With an introduction by J. I. Packer, this book includes topics for those passionate about families or those teaching on the characteristics of a godly family. Richard Baxter covers topics such as marriage, children, and family worship methodically and comprehensively through both hypothetical and real-life questions and concerns that arise in family dynamics. He uses arguments, objections, and frequent Scripture to help husbands, wives, and children to live godly lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;More than three centuries ago, Puritan church leader Baxter compiled a 1,143-page tome entitled &lt;em&gt;Christian Directory&lt;/em&gt;, which included a section on family life. &lt;em&gt;The Godly Home&lt;/em&gt; is the only stand-alone version of that section of &lt;em&gt;Christian Directory.&lt;/em&gt; Editor Randall Pederson has updated the language and syntax to make this seventeenth-century collection of words one that will continue on for generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
