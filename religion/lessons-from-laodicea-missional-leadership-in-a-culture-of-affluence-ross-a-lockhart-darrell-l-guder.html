  <title>Lessons from Laodicea: Missional Leadership in a Culture of Affluence - Ross A. Lockhart, Darrell L. Guder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I&#39;m rich and I don&#39;t need a thing,&quot; bragged the early Christians in the big city of Laodicea. The Apostle John, however, saw their affluence and arrogance through a theological lens. He declared them to be bankrupt, &quot;lukewarm Christians&quot; whom God would gladly gargle and spit out. Today, the mainline church in the West finds itself in a dominant culture of Laodicean affluence, where even faith is a commodity to be consumed. While the gospel spreads and thrives in the global South and East, the Western mainline church looks longingly back at Christendom and forward in fear. As Christians living in a North American culture that highly prizes the unholy Trinity of individualism, consumerism, and secularism, we require a new kind of missional leadership to &quot;pray&quot; attention to what God is doing in the world around us. This book names the challenges and promises inherent in partnering with the Holy Spirit in order to offer missional leadership in a culture of affluence. It is about both living in Laodicea and leaving it behind. We are no longer in a Babylonian captivity but a Laodicean one. This work helps chart a course for Christians who long to let go of &quot;country club religion&quot; and instead belong to a community that helps equip missionary disciples, resistant to the dominant culture and resplendent in the love of our triune God." />
