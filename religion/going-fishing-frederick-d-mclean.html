  <title>Going Fishing - Frederick D. McLean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a dream, have you ever thought God was trying to tell you something? Have you ever awakened from a dream with deep burning conviction, knowing that somehow your dream was going to come to pass? Thats the way I felt over five years ago, not long after I had been called to serve as Pastor of the Lees Chapel Missionary Baptist Church. My prayer was for God to give me the gift of witnessing to the lost. So one night in a dream, God showed me the secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Ive had many opportunities to use the tools God gave me that night. The dream is still clear in my mind. I want to share with you some of those vital tools, such as love, prayers, patience, kindness, and endurance. Every Christian believer ought to be witnessing to the lost. It may be one of your family members, a friend, or a coworker. Please dont give up on them too soon. Remember to live a Godly life because the life you live in front of them just might be the only Bible they will ever read. &lt;/p&gt;" />
