  <title>I Am Redeemed - Phyllis E. Jones Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bible condemns drunkenness and alcohol abuse but makes no specific reference to drug abuse, eating disorders, workaholics, or most other addictions that concern us today. In many societies, thousands of individuals are addicted to alcohol, drugs, television, compulsive spending, sexual immorality, smoking, overeating and a host of other behaviors.
An addiction is anything or a behavior that is habitual, repetitious and difficult or impossible to control. Usually the addiction brings short-term pleasure, but there may be long-term consequences in terms of ones health and welfare. Addictions tend to be progressive conditions that slowly exert more and more power and control over the individual.
As people move from infancy toward maturity, they travel through developmental periods in which people have somewhat similar characteristics. Each individual advances through various stages in life-all distinctly different-to maturity. The infant stage differs greatly from the junior high, but both contribute to the total development in the life span of the individual.
For the Christian there are two aspects of personality developments. One relates to the natural human personality and the other is the Christian personality. Personality, in the natural human sense, is a term describing the total of what people are physically, intellectually, socially, emotionally and spiritually. It includes every aspect and area of life. 
From birth personality is influenced and molded by many forces, heredity and environment being the major forces. Within the environment, mainly family, school, church, peer group and society influence a person.
Subsequent, physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual structure is built upon the foundation of early childhood. Growth and development are not synonymous terms. Growth means to increase in size, function and complexity up to maturity. Development implies change over time in structure, thought and behavior caused by biological and environmental influences.  
As the individual experience the human development from birth to adulthood, the addicted too must endure to achieve redemption from the bondage of sin for God always takes us back to the root of the situation.  Thereby, the elementary stage is evident when one begins Gods process of redemption. 
God planned our Redemption. His Son and the Holy Spirit executed it. This redemption demonstrated the eternal defeat of Satan. Jesus stripped him of his authority and dominion after He had paid the penalty of mans transgression." />
