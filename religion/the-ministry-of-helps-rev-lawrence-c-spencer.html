  <title>The Ministry of Helps - Rev. Lawrence C. Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had that sinking feeling that you were missing out on something very valuable in your ministry but just couldnt put your finger on it? Well, these resources for adventures in service to God for the church are valuable assets to those seeking a dynamic experience in Gods Kingdom work. To invest yourself in Larry Spencers Ministry of Helps Manual and Workbook can enhance your ministry and greatly format your service with usable hands on tools that complete your tool chest. Bring these practical things home and put them to work. Great results have already been seen from individuals who respect Gods Word and value what it can bring to the Board room as well as to the church service. You will not be sorry you invested in this training for you and your ministry team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Rev. Lloyd Tremain, Paradise Community Church of the Nazarene&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A thorough, practical and much needed Biblically sound treatment.  Wish it had been available 20 years ago when I could have use it to a great positive effect&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Dan Wilderman, Retired Assemblies of God Pastor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the order and practical instruction presented will benefit all organizational levels of any Christian Church today.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; John Steffensen, Radio Host, Christ Today KKXX Radio Chico CA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this manual will lay the groundwork for pastors and churches to spread the burden and get others involved in the work of the ministry. I once had a pastor that was often unprepared for a service because he was busy helping a parishioner with some needed chore, or church maintenance, or the myriad other duties needed to keep a church going. The result was that the church stayed the same size. Some leave; others enter. But no growth was apparent despite the considerable preaching talents of the pastor. God is apparently making sure he has only the amount of people that he can handle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn that the ancient church had some of the same challenges we face today. Acts 6:14 says, Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a complaint against the Hebrews by the Hellenists, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution. Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. (Read this as doing manual labor.) Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business; (the manual labor) but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word. It was even bringing strife to the local body. What did they do? And what was the result?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The first thing the apostles did was pick out people they knew to be wise and that had had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit and appointed them to do practical ministerial duties (the manual labor). This freed up the apostles so they could minister the Word of God. Wow, Gods way is so simple, and our grandiose plans just waste time and get nothing done. Pastors need to learn from the apostles and appoint over this business so the pastors has more time to do the spiritual work that promotes Gods church. This manual gives a road map for accomplishing the goal of choosing and training people and tips for managing them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
