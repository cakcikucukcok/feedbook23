      <meta name="description" content="God is Beginning to Reveal the Pattern For His End Times Church - It is Bigger Than Anyone Could Have Imagined - Since the time of Paul, God has been revealing how He wants His church to be built. But the Church only went so far before it stopped, and it did not progress anymore.   Did We Reach The Perfect Church That God Wants?   No, because the Lord has begun to reveal once again to His Apostles what He wants His Church to look like. This is the mandate of Apostle Les, and in this book he shares what the Lord has revealed to him about the End Times Church.   This book is only the beginning as God is still revealing and leading. And the Church of the future will not be the same as it always was. But it will be a church filled with God&#39;s power, that will shine like a beacon in this world.   If God has called you to take part in building His final Church, then this is your handbook that will get you started to move into what God has for you." />
