  <title>Unconnected - David O. Bullock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel like something is missing in your life? Have you ever wondered where things went wrong or how you got off track with your hopes and dreams? Are you plagued by questions for which there seem to be no answers? Do you feel a disconnect between the life you always wanted and your life as it is?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unconnected&lt;/em&gt; takes you on a journey through some amazing stories of incredible life change. These people discovered the connection that turned their lives completely around. Each story begins as a tragic tale of hopelessness and despair, but ends in triumph and the true joy of living life to the full.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You can learn the difference the connection can make in your own life. Author David Bullock describes in detail the steps you need to take on your own journey to connection. Be forewarned that he believes everyone needs to laugh at least once a day, so dont be surprised if his style occasionally leaves you laughing out loud. At other times you may find yourself crying as you read stories filled with struggle and heartbreak. You may even find that you can personally identify with some of them. In the end, you may understand how you too can escape the unconnected life and enter into a beautiful new world of connection. Do you want that? If so, then take this journey. &lt;em&gt;Unconnected&lt;/em&gt; may have been written just for you!&lt;/p&gt;" />
