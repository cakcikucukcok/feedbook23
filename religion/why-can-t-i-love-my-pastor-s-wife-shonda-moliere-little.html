  <title>Why Can’T I Love My Pastor’S Wife? - Shonda Moliere Little</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why Cant I Love My Pastors Wife was written to expose and unsilence the truth about the pastors wife and how she is often treated in the church. Attitudes concerning the pastors wife have been one of the hindering forces that have hindered the church from going forth. There has been a masquerade in the church that says that everything is well. This area has been completely silenced too long.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this book, Shonda Little asks a very thought-provoking question. She asks, Why cant I love my pastors wife? In this very personal and heartfelt book, she manages to address this very sensitive question through her personal experiences as a pastors wife and through the Bible.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Romans 15:7 tells us to receive ye one another as Christ also received us to the glory of God. This means that we are to receive the pastors wife as well as the pastor. The church has to love and accept the pastors wife because they are one. They cannot be separated. You cannot love the pastor on the scale of ten and love the wife on the scale of five. This area has been an underlying factor that has been in the church to keep it hindered and divided. There must be unity in this area in the church. When this happens, there is division. The devil uses this to cause division in the church. God said that where there is unity, there is strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will unsilence this area in the church so that the church can move forward in unity and the love of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
