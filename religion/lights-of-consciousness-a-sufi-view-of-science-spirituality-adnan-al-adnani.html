  <title>Lights of Consciousness:  A Sufi view of Science &amp; Spirituality - Adnan Al Adnani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The aim of this book is to show that scientific and spiritual quests are one and the same. The search for truth, the truth of our existence, is one in which consciousness is its essential reality that drives and unifies all, at every level of existence, seen and unseen. Views from the foundations of science, philosophy and spirituality are presented.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Adnani highlights the key discoveries that lead to paradigm shifts in our evolution of consciousness, and how these shifts have brought us closer to the nature of reality that must exist at every level from the simple to the complex, and the inanimate to the sentient. It is the absolute certainty of our existence. The nature of reality is presented as a series of models or views that are more meditations on the self, rooted in the science of consciousness, since any description of reality can only be communicated in a limited fashion through words.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this book, the foundations of science and spirituality are explored with the aim to present a unified view integrating the objective outer view and the subjective inner view as a science of Oneness free from conflict.&lt;/p&gt;" />
