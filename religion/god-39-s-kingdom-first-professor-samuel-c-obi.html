  <title>God&#39;s Kingdom First - Professor Samuel C. Obi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gods Kingdom First is written for all the folks who really want to see true success in their Christian lives. One of the secrets to living a truly successful godly life is by knowing what Gods children are expected to do and doing it. In Matthew 6:10, Jesus prayed for Gods kingdom to come and that Gods will would be done on earth as it is done in heaven. He advised us to seek first the kingdom and righteousness of God, and then all the other things we need in life would be given to us as well. Many of Gods children do not think about this important topic and then wonder why their lives are often in a state of doldrums, uninteresting, and disordered. This book discusses what the kingdom of God is, why it is important, and how we can seek it. 
The contents of this book are not new but have revealing secrets to a Christians successful life in the Kingdom of God." />
