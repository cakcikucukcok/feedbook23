  <title>Nourishment for the Spiritual Pilgrimage: Daily Devotions for Christian Disciples - Vernon T. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;In the morning, while it was still very dark, he got up and went out to a deserted place, and there he prayed&quot; (Mark 1:35). Jesus taught by his words and actions. He went by himself to pray when he was tired, when faced with upcoming trying events, or when he just wanted to be alone in the presence of his Lord. He gave us guidance about what to pray, how to pray, and why to pray, and was very familiar with the Hebrew Scriptures. Thus, if we want to become Jesus&#39; disciple we should follow his model and invest time and emotional energy into prayer, Bible study, and reflection. Nourishment For The Spiritual Pilgrimage provides an aid for those who want to participate in the spiritual pilgrimage of becoming a lifelong disciple of Jesus Christ. It offers insight and support for those who daily want to turn their hearts, souls, and minds to God&#39;s will in their lives, as they strive to help in bringing about God&#39;s kingdom in this present time. There are countless other devotionals, but hopefully this can offer something that many of the others may not, a specific focus on the concept of discipleship." />
