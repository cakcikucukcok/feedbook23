Things said in this book have and will continue to move rapidly. You should observe these and other particular lifestyles of ordinary people in all magnitudes. The writer therefore urges you to please not prejudge other people or their lifestyles.
The events and characters you are about to read about per God, in whom  we trust and obey, had to happen, and its called blessings from God and may or may not be isolated incidents that are in full operation today as it were in the past.
The majority of this book deals with revealing a unique structural lifestyle pattern mainly with drugs. Such is Gods will, which is normal activities for Gods people and essential lifestyle qualities of life. 
I should try and imagine if it were them. Would you want others to look down on you as if you were a waste of human flesh?" />
