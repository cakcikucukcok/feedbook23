  <title>Free Indeed - Chaplain Larry Briggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Working daily now for over eight years in this environment has opened my eyes and heart to the epidemic of crime in America and the horrible consequences it has on both the criminal and their victims. Most of our correctional facilities are under- funded, under staffed and in dire need of renovated and/or new facilities to secure the inmate population they are required to service. At Riverside where I am privileged to minister our facilities are modern, exceptionally clean and managed by a top-notch staff. Even with these assets our stress level is very high as we seek to house and provide care for a daily average of 1300 inmates. It takes an incredible amount of time, talent and finances for the sworn staff to maintain security and a safe environment for both the inmate population and our staff. This is true in any jail or prison and the average citizen has no concept what it is really like on the inside. I have developed such a high respect for Correctional Officers who work every day on the front line, the civilian staff who provide much needed programs and support and most of all, the Command staff and Administrators who are responsible for the over-all management of these facilities. They need and deserve our daily prayers." />
