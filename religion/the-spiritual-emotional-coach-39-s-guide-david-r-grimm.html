  <title>The Spiritual &amp; Emotional Coach&#39;s Guide - David R. Grimm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Help Overcoming Painful Experiences (H.O.P.E.) is a non-profit organization whose purpose is to help people experience a life transformation through their emotional pain so they can live the purpose-filled, victorious life God intended and designed them to live.  We set people free from emotional bondage and empower them to live a transformed life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accomplish our purpose, the H.O.P.E. program was designed to help people 1) resurrect hope, 2) overcome emotional pain from a variety of issues, 3) build a safe and healthy support network, 4) comprehend the truths about God in the midst of pain while exposing and replacing lies, and 5) experience a life transformation through the healing and restorative power of Jesus Christ. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Our transformation model consists of three levels.  The Spiritual &amp; Emotional Coachs Guide is used in Level 2 when we pair our members with a Spiritual and Emotional Coach (SPEC).  SPECs allow us to extend our ministry by providing additional support for our members through a one-on-one mentoring relationship outside their small group.  The analogy used for our members need of a SPEC is that of a contractor who can help them with their emotional and spiritual construction.  Our members need a contractor (SPEC) who follows the plan of the Architect (Jesus Christ) in their life and who can help them rebuild by doing the same thing.  Our members need a contractor (SPEC) who can coach them using their own experiences with the spiritual and emotional rebuilding process. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, this book was designed to empower and equip our SPECs by helping them realize and tap into the knowledge and tools available to them in this role.  This book also contains a topical Scripture reference guide for convenient access to verses that can be applied to a variety of issues.  In addition, this book was designed to help familiarize SPECs with our organization and what their member is going through.&lt;/p&gt;" />
