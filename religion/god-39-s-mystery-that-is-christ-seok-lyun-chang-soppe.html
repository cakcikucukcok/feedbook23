  <title>God&#39;s Mystery That Is Christ - Seok Lyun Chang Soppe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At some point during our religious journey, we have to ask ourselves the questions: How much do we really know God? Are we spiritually dead or alive? And what phase is our faith in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning with the first chapter of Genesis, Gods mystery is hidden throughout the Bible. This book sets forth the importance of the creation story and describes the significance of each day. In addition, it reveals the secret of the Trinity and the meaning of Revelations Armageddon war, including the seven seals, trumpets, bowls, and the 666. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gods intentions are hidden in the Bible. A certain level of openness to the Bible is required to uncover Gods mystery that is hidden within it. This book was written for those who are on a quest to make a connection with God and to support the readers relationship with Christ. It is meant to be read along with The Holy Bible and not in place of it. The objective of this book is to challenge our preconceptions about biblical truths so that we may be able to discern Gods intent with the Spirit of Truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a great guide for those who thirst for the Spirit of God. It is a must read for all those seeking the Truth. The deep intentions, within Gods Word, are revealed to those who eagerly search for it.&lt;/p&gt;
