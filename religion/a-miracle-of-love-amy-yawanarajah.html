  <title>A Miracle of Love - Amy Yawanarajah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the heartbreaking story, The Miracle of Love, parents, Amy and Eric Yawanarajah, took their month-old child, Naveen, for what they believed was a routine medical visit after the baby contracted a cold. They heard the dreaded words that their son had a rare cardiac defect that could not be corrected.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;At the time, there were few known treatments for Naveen&#39;s type of congenital heart defect. The child&#39;s prognosis was he would be lucky to survive his seventh birthday! But Naveen&#39;s parents never gave up. They searched the globe until research led them to seek palliative treatment in New Zealand when Naveen was just four.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Naveen&#39;s strong belief in his ability to live a long life ultimately convinced his parents to accept his choice of Perth Western Australia for his tertiary studies. It was the benevolence of the insurance system of Australia that funded the young man&#39;s many cardiac procedures. Naveen lived to age thirty-two, well beyond the lifespan projected by Australian cardiac specialists.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is the true story of a young man whose love of life and people while living with a congenital heart condition, is a miracle which will be an inspiration to many.&lt;/p&gt;" />
