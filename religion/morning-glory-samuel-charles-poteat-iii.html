  <title>Morning Glory - Samuel Charles Poteat Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his book, Sam shares how God personally and radically intersects a persons life. When God enters our lives, it involves more than just a change in eternal destination, but also a vital transformation of the heart. After God initiates a faith relationship with Himself, He begins to teach us about Himself and how we are to relate to Him through His Word, through His Holy Spirit, and through everyday occurrences in the life of His child. In his book, Sam again and again relates to us how God works in our lives through the inspiration of His Word. Each devotion is about everyday experiences.  Each one makes a specific application to Gods Word. The singular purpose of God in the life of His child is to conform us to the image of His Son. He accomplishes this as His Word is applied to our everyday lives. &lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These devotions communicate to us the simplicity along with the profoundness of a loving Father manifesting His life and purposes to His child.&lt;p/&gt;
