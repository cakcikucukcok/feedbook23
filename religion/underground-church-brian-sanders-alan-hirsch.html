  <title>Underground Church - Brian Sanders, Alan Hirsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If the Church Truly Empowered People to Engage in God&#39;s Mission?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something extraordinary has been happening in Tampa, Florida. A new expression of the church has been quietly growing. It&#39;s something of an experiment, but over the last ten years the church has been validating its ideas with sustained and growing results. At The Underground&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;being the church is not focused around a weekly gathering or church programs. It&#39;s about empowering individuals to respond to God&#39;s call to ministry and mission, especially to the poor and disadvantaged in our midst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many churches talk about discerning calling and engaging in mission, very few are structured to make this their ministry focus. &lt;em&gt;Underground Church &lt;/em&gt;is a new vision for the church rooted in its biblical mission to share the love of God and serve the poor. Sanders explores how to make structural changes, how to think about leadership, how to fund ministries, and how to truly engage people in God&#39;s mission. Filled with creative insights, he explains what it means to center the mission of the church around the callings of individuals to outward ministry - whether that involves leading Bible studies in the workplace, feeding the homeless, or working to free women and children from sex trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book will both tell the inspiring story of a church that is rethinking what church looks like while also outlining and uncovering the principles that transfer for every church and Christian community that hopes for more. It&#39;s the true story of a 10-year experiment that unpacks the possibilities of a church structured and streamlined for mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X&lt;/p&gt;" />
