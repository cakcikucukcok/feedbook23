And its amazing to know that youre sealed as a child of God forever, but its not over. Were just like the disciples of Jesus. He had to take them on a journey of growth on so many levels, but most importantly, He had to grow them spiritually. Their journey was packed with many highs and lows, but at the end, theres a living hope in Jesus Christ. Im on the same journey with life being packed with highs and lows. In the meantime, Im still on the right path, being conformed to the image of Christ." />
