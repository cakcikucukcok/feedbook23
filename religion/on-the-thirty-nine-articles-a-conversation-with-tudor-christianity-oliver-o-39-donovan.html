  <title>On the Thirty-Nine Articles: A Conversation with Tudor Christianity - Oliver O&#39;Donovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Thirty-Nine Articles, together with the Book of Common Prayer, form the foundation of Anglican theology. Yet there are very few extended treatments of them. Oliver O&#39;Donovan relates the Articles to the exhilarating and troubled century in which they took shape. He also shows how the distinctive insights and values of a past age relate to the demands of today&#39;s world. &#39;What I propose in this case - is not to talk solely about the Articles, but to talk about God, mankind (sic!), and redemption, the central matters of the Christian faith, and to take the Tudor authors with me as companions in discussion. Two voices will be speaking - each raising the questions that Christian faith in his time forces upon him.&#39; Here is a new edition of his book on one of the key texts of Anglican identity by one of the UK&#39;s leading theologians. The book has been out of print for some time and there have been repeated calls for a new edition with a new introduction which engages with more recent developments and offers the text to a new generation." />
