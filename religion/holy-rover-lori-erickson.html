  <title>Holy Rover - Lori Erickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From her childhood on an Iowa farm, Lori Erickson grew up to travel the world as a writer specializing in holy sites—journeys that led her on an ever-deepening spiritual quest. In &lt;i&gt;Holy Rover&lt;/i&gt;, she weaves her personal narrative with descriptions of a dozen pilgrimages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her trips give Erickson the chance to reflect on her Lutheran upbringing, her flirtation with Wicca, and her admiration for Tibetan Buddhism. A trip to the healing shrine of Lourdes is intertwined with the story of her son’s serious illness as a baby, while visiting Thoreau’s Walden Pond blends with ruminations on being a writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, Erickson encounters spiritual leaders who include the chief priest of the Icelandic pagan religion of Asatru, a Trappist monk at Thomas Merton’s Gethsemani Abbey, and a Lakota retreat director at South Dakota’s Bear Butte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both irreverent and devout, &lt;i&gt;Holy Rover&lt;/i&gt; includes images of holy sites around the world taken by several of the nation’s leading travel photographers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travel writer, Episcopal deacon, and author of the &lt;i&gt;Holy Rover&lt;/i&gt; blog at &lt;i&gt;Patheos&lt;/i&gt;, Erickson is an engaging guide for pilgrims eager to take a spiritual journey. Her book describes travels that changed her life—and can change yours, too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
