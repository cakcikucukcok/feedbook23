Jacobs's The Year of Living Biblically, evangelical pastor and author Dobson (The Jesus Study Bible) devotes a year to emulating Jesus' life and teaching. His initial commitment to keep kosher, observe Jewish holy days, not shave and read the four gospels weekly expands into an exploration of Judeo-Christian devotional practices.<br /><b><i>The Year of Living like Jesus: My Journey of Discovering ...</i></b> | Ed Dobson is a neat guy. He cares more about living the way Jesus wants us to live than he does about anything else, and this is what makes him a neat guy. He is touched by A.J Jacobs' attempt to spend an entire year literally living out what the Bible says. But A.J focused mainly on the Hebrew Bible. Ed wants to focus on the gospels.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: The Year of Living like Jesus: My Journey of ...</i></b> | "The Year of Living Like Jesus" by Edward Dobson, right from the start, is a gimmick. Dobson has no qualms about saying that he was inspired by AJ Jacobs book, "The Year of Living Biblically" where Jacobs apparently tried to live according to Old Testament law (I haven't read that book).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Year of Living like Jesus - Edward G.
