  <title>Pieces - Patricia Williams-Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our lives should always be rejuvenated, renewed, and revitalized. If not, what would be the outcome? It is never too late to resuscitate ourselves, our visions, and aspirations. Created in His image, God made us whole. We are not missing a thing. Sometimes we feel like we are shattered and have left pieces behind that are gone forever, but they are not.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The pieces of our lives predetermine a destiny. What pieces given to you have been misplaced, forsaken, pushed asunder, buried, tossed to the wind, stolen, etc.? Their value is inconceivable in life because they justify the blueprint regarding your purpose and its pursuit in life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The compilation of &lt;em&gt;Pieces&lt;/em&gt; addresses the resurrection of failures, broken dreams, hopes, aspirations, and whatever else caused the pieces of your life to seemingly unravel and cause you to question your identity and existence. Simply resuscitate and live! Live your abundant, predestined life. Why? Because you were created in the image of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pieces&lt;/em&gt; reflects who you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; are, not who you &gt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; you are. You have to be cognizant of who you are in the eyes of God. You are called to soar on eagles wings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pieces&lt;/em&gt; launches you in that direction. Take flight!&lt;/p&gt;" />
