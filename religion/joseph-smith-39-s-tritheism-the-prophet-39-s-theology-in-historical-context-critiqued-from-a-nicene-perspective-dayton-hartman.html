  <title>Joseph Smith&#39;s Tritheism: The Prophet&#39;s Theology in Historical Context, Critiqued from a Nicene Perspective - Dayton Hartman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I have always declared God to be a distinct personage, Jesus Christ a separate and distinct personage from God the Father, and that the Holy Ghost was a distinct personage and a Spirit: and these three constitute three distinct personages and three Gods.  --Joseph Smith   Few figures in North American religious history are quite as enigmatic as Joseph Smith. His unabashed adherence to tritheism gave birth to one of the most influential religious movements in American history. Many attempts have been made to engage his life and unorthodox theology. However, Joseph Smith&#39;s Tritheism is a unique text that blends church history, thoughtful theological exegesis, and evangelical apologetics in an attempt to engage Joseph Smith&#39;s theology anew." />
