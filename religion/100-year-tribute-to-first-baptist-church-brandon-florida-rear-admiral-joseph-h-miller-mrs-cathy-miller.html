  <title>100 Year Tribute to First Baptist Church Brandon, Florida - Rear Admiral Joseph H. Miller, Mrs. Cathy Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is unique. There is no other tribute like it. The church is the people. The people who are true Christians are listed in Gods Book in heaven. This church has survived for 100 years because of small groups of people.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;There is no church history book that lists over 100 pages of testimonies from people about how their church has blessed them. Their testimonials are a book in itself. One cannot read the testimonial section and not be blessed. True Christians, for the first time, have been given the opportunity  to speak for God as a testimony to the world about one of His universal churches.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book lists some of the great sermons of the ministry leaders of the church.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The many problems that Gods people and the church must face the next hundred years are listed.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The churches in America are in a spiritual declined in influence and numbers. The people must act! Probably the only known course for this to happen is in the summary of this book.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only One Church that will be exalted and glorified during the End Times.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gods church, founded by Jesus Apostles 2000 years ago, is based on the teachings of Christ Jesus. The First Baptist Church of Brandon was brought into existence by men of God based on New Testament teachings.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;700 years before Jesus was born there were fifty prophecies about Jesus in Isaiah alone. Some scholars call Isaiah The Fifth Gospel after Matthew Mark, Luke, and John. (46, p. 187)&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love your neighbor as yourself. (Lev. 19:18) was written 1400 years before Christ. John describes Jesus at the Creation. In the beginning was the Word ,and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. (John 1:1)&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tribute is a model for any church.&lt;/p&gt;" />
