  <title>Ministry Beyond the Pulpit - Pauline Adongo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Titles and talents are NOT prerequisites for service. Each believer is uniquely and individually gifted by God and has the capacity and capability to minister to others. Jesus Christ in His mandate to the His followers said go ye; there are no special titles or designations tied to this mandate other that those who believe, Mark 16:14-20. The main objective of this book is to encourage each believer to recognize the platform God has given them to accomplish the Great Commission. This platform may be a career, vocation, business, home environment or department in a church. This platform is what I refer to as your pulpit. Each believer has one.  Once you have recognized your pulpit, I discuss how both natural gifts, talents and spiritual gifts can be applied collectively to minister to others. The harvest is still plenteous. Having been already empowered by Jesus, let us join together in gathering the harvest. Go ahead and minister wherever you are!&lt;/p&gt;" />
