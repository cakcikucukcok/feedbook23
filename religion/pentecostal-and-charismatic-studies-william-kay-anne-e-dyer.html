  <title>Pentecostal and Charismatic Studies - William Kay, Anne E. Dyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Pentecostal and Charismatic movement is one of the miracles of the 20th century. Without government support, without an advertising campaign, often without the notice of journalists and academics and sometimes in the face of persecution and ridicule, it has spread its message around the world and now attracts in the region of 500 million people. Many of its original and formative documents are unknown and out of print. This book collects together samples from the writings of key Pentecostals and charismatics going back about 100 years and, over a range of issues and practices, shows how they vary and how they have developed historically. These texts have lain in out of print magazines and archives and, so far as we know, have never been collected before in this way. This book allows you to hear the authentic voice of the Pentecostal and charismatic movements, drawing especially from sources in English." />
