  <title>A Kingdom Divided Cannot Stand - Will Zimmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Kingdom Divided Cannot Stand&lt;/em&gt; explains the importance of Christians breaking through traditions and uniting as the body of Christ. It does not matter which church a Christian chooses to attend, because ultimately they are all members of the body of Christ (Christ&#39;s church). Manmade traditions can and will hinder the promises of God in a persons life. As the end of the age quickly approaches, it is becoming more important for Christs church to unite. Find out how current events line up with biblical prophecy and how close we are to the end of the age. &lt;em&gt;A Kingdom Divided Cannot Stand&lt;/em&gt; will answer common questions such as: What will happen next? Why did Christ allude to the days of Lot and Noah when describing the end of the age? Is the Old Law still in effect today? Are Christians accountable to the Old Law or the New Law? What did Christ do when He fulfilled the Old Law? &lt;em&gt;A Kingdom Divided Cannot Stand&lt;/em&gt; also includes a medically updated version of the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
