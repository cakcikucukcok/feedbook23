  <title>The Jesus Command - Matthew Milam Ii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me (Matthew 11:29 NIV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any image, no matter what kind, is simply a rendition of the original. The copy must follow the impression made by the master. In unlocking the pattern of making a True Disciple, a close and detailed study of Jesus, the master, must be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discipleship is an important charge, carrying a great responsibility. When entering the task of preparing another as a disciple, heed should be taken. Careand cautionplay a big part in the equation. In both instances, whether one serves as instructor or student, as Jesus said, one must above all, consider the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Wont you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? (Luke 14:28 NIV)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rather than being an event that one arrives at, Discipleship is more of a journey that is traveled over the course of ones life. Each step is part of a process by which we adapt, learning to grow more Christ-like along the way. We take His yoke and learn from Him, just as the men who became His Apostles did. The cost necessary involves not only a loving devotion to Jesus, but to do so from a willing and obedient heart. The Jesus Command, the command to love one another as He loved us, creates a new beginning for everyone that accepts it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
