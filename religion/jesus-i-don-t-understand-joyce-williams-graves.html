  <title>Jesus, I Don’T Understand - Joyce Williams Graves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Facing tragedy in her life, seventeen-year-old Rachel McDonald goes on a spiritual journey as Christ Jesus answers her questions. Rachel knows that God loves her, but she still is unclear about why bad things have happened to her, her sister, and her best friend. This narrative study explains Gods love and compassion for Rachel and for everyone through the inspired Word of His Son, Christ Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jesus, I Dont Understand&lt;/i&gt; describes Gods endless love, mercy, and grace as Christ Jesus speaks to Rachels heart as only a Father could. Rachel, a young Christian girl, attends a Bible study class every Wednesday with her best friend, Matthew Lacy. When a terrible accident occurs, however, it changes her faith in the goodness of God and His promises. All the things she learned in her Bible study classes begin to unravel for her. She feels alone and confused, and she has three important questions for Christ Jesus:&lt;/p&gt;
Why do children die so young?&lt;/br&gt;
Why do young people get sick?&lt;/br&gt;
Are we really going to heaven when we die?&lt;/p&gt;" />
