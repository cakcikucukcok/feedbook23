  <title>Islam Folklore Tales of Luqman The Wise Bilingual Edition English &amp; Spanish - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Luqman (also known as Luqman the Wise, Luqmaan, Lukman, and Luqman al-Hakeem. was a wise man for whom Surah Luqman, the thirty-first sura (chapter) of the Qur&amp;#39;an, was named. Luqman (c. 1100 BC) is believed to be from Africa and is of Ethiopian descent. There are many stories about Luqman in Persian, Arabic and Turkish literature and the primary historical sources are the Tafsir ibn Kathir and Stories of the Qur&amp;#39;an by Ibn Kathir.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Qur&amp;#39;an does not state whether or not Luqman was a prophet, but some people believe him to be a prophet and thus write Alayhis salaam (A.S.) with his name. Luqman was described as a perceptive man, always watching the animals and plants of his surroundings, and he tried to understand the world based on what he saw. One day, whilst sleeping under a tree, an angel came to him and said that Allah wanted to bestow a gift upon Luqman: either wisdom or being king.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Luqman chose wisdom, and when he woke from his slumber, he was aware that his senses and understanding had sharpened. He felt in complete harmony with nature and could understand the inner meaning of things, beyond their physical reality. Immediately he bowed down, thanked and praised Allah for this wonderful gift." />
