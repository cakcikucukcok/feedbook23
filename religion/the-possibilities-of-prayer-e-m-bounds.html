  <title>The Possibilities of Prayer - E. M. Bounds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ministry of prayer has been the peculiar distinction of all of God&#39;s saints. This has been the secret of their power. The energy and the soul of their work has been the closet. The need of help outside of man being so great, man&#39;s natural inability to always judge kindly, justly, and truly, and to act the Golden Rule, so prayer is enjoined by Christ to enable man to act in all these things according to the Divine will. By prayer, the ability is secured to feel the law of love, to speak according to the law of love, and to do everything in harmony with the law of love." />
