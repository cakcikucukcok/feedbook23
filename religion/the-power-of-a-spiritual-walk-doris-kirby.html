  <title>The Power of a Spiritual Walk - Doris Kirby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We have been given the authority to walk in the Spirit. God is the Spirit, and we must worship Him in Spirit and Truth. There are two forces of the Spirit, a good spirit and an evil spirit. There is a conflict or spiritual warfare between the spirit and the flesh. Our flesh wants to do whatever it pleases; we want to feel good. But the spiritual man wars against the flesh.
Adam brought sin into the world by yielding to his flesh and disobeying Gods instructions. After Adam sinned, Jesus came into the world to set us free from the bondage of sin and bring us back to a right relationship with God. Jesus leaves the Comforter for our sake.	
The Holy Spirit of God will lead you to greater wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of the natural and spiritual realm of God. He is our teacher. And do not conform but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God (Romans 12:2).
The Comforter, who is the Holy Ghost, will guide you into all truth. The Holy Spirit gives us power to cast out demons. Jesus said we will do greater works than He did.
The Holy Spirit is an intercessor who prays for us in that He knows what we need of before we ask God. He knows the heart of God. The Holy Spirit prays for us through our utterance of tongues.  
The power of a spiritual walk operates in the gifts of healing, discernment, and deliverance.  This is what was spoken by the Prophet Joel; that in the last days, God will pour out His Spirit on all men. 
God is freely giving His Spirit to mankind; you will be able to see demonic spirits that walk this earth. The power of a spiritual walk can keep you from all of Satans attacks and devices.
You have power after the Holy Spirit comes upon you. You will have power to live a sanctified life in Jesus Christ. Join me in the power of a spiritual walk.
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen (Revelation 22:21)." />
