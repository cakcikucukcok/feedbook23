  <title>Journey to Wholeness - Hyacinth Unicee Wheeler-Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What if your setbacks could be turned into setups?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her own mortality flashed across her mind. &amp;#39;How could this be? Why was it happening all over again?&amp;#39; she thought. Her heart raced as she grappled with the words &amp;#39;there is no cure&amp;#39; echoing through her mind. Time stood still while the world carried on around her. She felt numb. Turning to her God, she asked: &amp;#39;What are you saying, Father?&amp;#39;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journeys can be long and arduous with many rough terrains; at times we must bare all (strip right down) to God. Then the journey brings us &lt;em&gt;face to face with ourselves, our relationships and our God&amp;#39; &lt;/em&gt;Daystar Reflection).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her autobiography, Hyacinth takes you on a journey to help you find answers. Drawing on the inner strength, she attributes to God, she rises to her challenges and shows how she overcame against the odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch of &lt;em&gt;Journey to Wholeness&lt;/em&gt; is borne out of her own health challenges, which she faced several times. She describes these challenges as &lt;em&gt;deja vu&lt;/em&gt; moments. Time after time, she found herself standing at the same crossroad, where she would make life changing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured into different journeys and written optimistically, Hyacinth takes you through the emotional roller coaster of the highs and lows of the journey, from sickness and despair to healing, wellness and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;" />
