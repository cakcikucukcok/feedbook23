  <title>Tell Satan Off! - Ven. S.K. Olawoyin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="TELL SATAN OFF!
Satan is real, his power and influences on earth are real. But more real is our faith in the ultimate God through Jesus Christ, His indwelling power of the Holy Spirit in us and the efficacy of His Word.
We have caches of divine weapons, mysterious to the hordes of darkness, made available to every believer in Christ Jesus alongside with the power of attorney to subdue power of darkness, bind Satan and cast devils out.
If you do not want to be a victim of the devil, you must always live in the consciousness of the endued power God in you, because the enemy is not cut out for your healing or deliverance. The world is out to milk or mock you or even do both to you; all they need is your permission. Will you let them?
In this book you will discover:
?	Who demons are and how they operate
?	Why a born again believer cannot be possessed by demons
?	What happens when a man is possessed, obsessed and oppressed
?	Who actually needs deliverance ministration
?	How temptations come and how to overcome them
?	How to cast out demons and why they should be cast out
?	How to maintain ones victory after deliverance ministrations" />
