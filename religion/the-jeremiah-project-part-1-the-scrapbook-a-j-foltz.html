  <title>The Jeremiah Project Part 1—The Scrapbook - A.J. Foltz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Turn off all the noise, and get yourself comfortable. Jeremiah invites you in. The Jeremiah Project Part 1The Scrapbook has the bones of a study guide but as Scripture is searched and questions are answered the study takes on the form of a novelette. The study begins with Jeremiahs official appointment. Jeremiah will represent the Lord in a monumental court case that administers justice. This case still affects us today.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Lord had a legal and binding relationship with Israel. Their relationship is compared to marriage in this study of Gods Word. When God acquired Israel as a vessel-bride, Israel acquired Gods promises, which were outlined in a living and breathing contract. The once gracious contract which united the two parties in holy union has by legal recourse become a beast which, in study, serves to bind the pair in its merciless grip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jeremiah Project Part 1The Scrapbook is a user-friendly study that you cannot afford to miss. Its like finding a few more pieces to that big puzzle of life. Some of us have a good start at putting it all together, but the picture of life becomes a little clearer and makes more sense after spending some time with Jeremiah. You will find insightful information as he, by appointment from God, delivers wisdom, comfort, and strength that will get many through the upheaval in our world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
