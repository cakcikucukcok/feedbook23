      <meta name="description" content="This book is dedicated to anyone who will dare take the Living Word of God  from the Bible; obey and believe it. That is whole purpose of this book.
God is not a man, that He should lie; neither the son of man, that He should repent: hath He said, and shall He not do it? Or hath He spoken, and shall He not make it good? 
Numbers 23:19 (KJV)
For as the rain and snow come down from Heaven, And do not return there without watering the earth, Making it bear and sprout, And providing seed to the sower and bread to the eater, 11 So will My Word be which goes out of My mouth; It will not return to Me void (useless, without result), Without accomplishing what I desire, And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.
Isaiah 55:10-11 (AMP)
Annah Kimani is also the author of the book Be Obedient to Gods Calling; When He Calls You, Will You Answer? This book is available in black and white; and also in colour." />
