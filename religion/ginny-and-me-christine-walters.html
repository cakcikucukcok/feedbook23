  <title>Ginny and Me: - Christine Walters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 18.4px;&quot;&gt;Ginny and Me: Reflections of What God Can Do is a deep personal story about my troubled relationship with my mother, who lived with a severe mental illness. Ginny, died unexpectedly at Christmas season, and buried later on Mothers Day weekend. My story addresses how God carried me, and several social issues including mental health, child neglect and abuse, domestic violence, loss and grief.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 18.4px;&quot;&gt;Abuse is damaging. It comes from cycles of abusive behaviors learned and repeated through generations. Because of shame and embarrassment, many people do not speak about the cruelty they endured. In my case, most of the abuse I suffered resulted from my mothers mental illness. For my entire life, people told me to excuse my moms abuse because she was mentally ill. However, mental illness does not give anyone the right to abuse you (in particular, your child).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 18.4px;&quot;&gt;Ginny had childhood paranoid schizophrenia with multiple personality disorder. She lived in the Buffalo State Hospital through her adolescent years. When released from the hospital, she had me. She was twenty-six, and my dad was thirty years older. My mother was white, and my father was black.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 18.4px;&quot;&gt;As a child, I struggled with my mixed heritage. My mom would tell me that white people did not like me because I was black. Even from a religious standpoint, I was raised as a Catholic and Baptist. On Sundays, my mom and I attended mass without my father and Baptist service with him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 18.4px;&quot;&gt;I always felt like I had to choose. Was I black? Was I white? Was I Catholic? Was I Baptist? My mom told me that her side of the family disliked my dad because he was black and my dads side of the family disliked my mom because she was white. Here I was stuck in the middle.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=&quot;font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 18.4px;&quot;&gt;I share my life story with the world through Gods glory. My story is about how faith enabled me to overcome extraordinary struggles, pain, and loss. Faith, hope, and forgiving the unforgivable through prayer and trusting in God are the keys to healing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
