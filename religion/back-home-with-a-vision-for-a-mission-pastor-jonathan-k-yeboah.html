  <title>Back Home with a Vision for a Mission - Pastor Jonathan K. Yeboah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book BACK HOME WITH A VISION FOR A MISSION is all about the great and awesome miracles the Lord has done in the entire life of the author. It also shows how God was merciful upon a boy born into a Christian home, in a village, but grew up into a society of city life living in disobedience to God with his sinful behaviour. He seldom went to Church, but when he did so on one Xmas Eve, he received a prophecy from the man of God. The same message was miraculously received from two different Men of God in different Churches in three consecutive years. Though the prophecy was fulfilled years later when the author migrated to Britain, yet whether consciously or unconsciously, he failed to give God the glory for what He had done in his life and for his life. He still grew more, idle in the things of God and continued living in all sorts of sin. However, his way of life which was in consistent disobedience to God resulted in near destruction of his life by a protracted illness of heart pain. Nevertheless, the God whom he dishonoured by his wicked and sinful character and unrepentant spirit, had not given up on him. He was like a lost sheep for many years of his life, but when the Lord found him He forgave him all.
One day was the turning point in his life when the author found a Bible at work and decided to read it. The Word of God became life as he continued reading unabated. From that day onwards the prodigal son was found, and the Lord began to do great and awesome miracles in his life, which he thought, were necessary to be recorded for all to see, and to read just for His glory, hence the publication of this book." />
