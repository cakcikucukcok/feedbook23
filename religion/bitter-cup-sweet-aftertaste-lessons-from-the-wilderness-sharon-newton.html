  <title>Bitter Cup, Sweet Aftertaste - Lessons from the Wilderness - Sharon Newton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.
John 10:10(b) (NLT)  
This study guide is the companion book to Bitter Cup, Sweet AftertasteLessons from the Wilderness by Sharon Newton. Together, the books are designed to teach you the crucial spiritual lessons you must learn on your journey through the wilderness. Mastering these lessons is required in order for you to enter into the abundant life that becomes available to you only when you are fulfilling the purpose for which God put you on this earth. 
This study guide is also designed to give you an opportunity for self-reflection and self-discovery. As you ask yourself the key questions that accompany each lesson, determine to prayerfully and honestly assess where you are relative to that lesson, and any additional lessons the Lord teaches you from that chapter. Then write down what youve learned and make the appropriate changes to your life. In doing so, you will position yourself for the Lord to lead you into the rich, satisfying life that He came just to give you.
Whether you are a man, woman, or teen, whether you listen from the pew or speak from the pulpit, whether you are seeking meaning and significance in life, are new to Christ, or are a mature believer, these books are for you. They are priceless resources that will guide you into your God-ordained destiny." />
