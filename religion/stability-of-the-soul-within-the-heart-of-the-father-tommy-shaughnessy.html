  <title>Stability of the Soul Within the Heart of the Father - Tommy Shaughnessy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All-too-often, the trials of life and the winds of adversity take many people by surprise, and they are blown to and fro as a result thereof. Trying to find stability of the soul within the confines of this life is like trying to harness the wind. Stability of the Soul within the Heart of the Father presents the idea that the immaterial soul was never meant to find peace or rest within this life, but only in the heart of the Father.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Stability of the Soul within the Heart of the Father invites the reader to take a journey through the pages of scripture, discovering how the saints of old found contentment and rest in this wearying life. Since these trials of life seem nothing short of certain and are all but destined to happen in the lives of Christians, the only proper thing to do is for one to acquaint oneself with the knowledge of the Holy One. This knowledge is intended to lead to joy inexpressible and peace surpassing all understanding, which cannot be found within this world.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Through proper understanding and foundational practices, Stability of the Soul within the Heart of the Father  presents a way for the soul of a gracious heart to find its proper resting place within the heart of the Father.&lt;/p&gt;" />
