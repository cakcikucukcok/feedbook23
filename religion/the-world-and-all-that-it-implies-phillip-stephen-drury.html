  <title>The World and All That It Implies - Phillip Stephen Drury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The main character is an irreverent, sardonic architect, shaped by the world of pharmaceuticals, who comes to the realization that his life needs retooling and proposes to set sail on a small boat and rethink his life. At sea, he is ravaged by a storm and his boat is capsized. At first, he is excited by the idea of a &amp;ldquo;true life struggle&amp;rdquo; but he is stranded at sea for more than a month and is near death when another storm hits and he is cast upon a small island with a dormant volcano. Using his limited survival skills he nurses himself back to health. He discovers a section shoreline where a huge amount of detritus has washed up from shipping containers that have spilled overboard. He is awash in Nike sneakers, crates of bottled water, office supplies and women&amp;rsquo;s clothing. His immersion in nature and forced self-reliance spawns a series of philosophical/psychological transformations. He uses the empty water bottles to write notes (ruminations on his thought process and experiences) and casts them out to sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here the focus shifts to two characters on the mainland, Izzy and Jacob, who each find a bottle that has washed up on the beach. Numerous posts appear on social media as other messages have washed ashore all around the world and the &amp;ldquo;bottlepodcasts&amp;rdquo; become the buzz of social media. Izzy finds mystical meaning in the discovery of the messages but Jacob remains skeptical and believes these messages to be some kind of prank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Izzy transforms into a spiritual &amp;ldquo;deliverer&amp;rdquo;, giving speeches in a nearby park and becomes a sensation. He has revelations of his own and the book ends when Izzy disappears at the end of his last park &amp;ldquo;happening&amp;rdquo; under mysterious circumstances&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
