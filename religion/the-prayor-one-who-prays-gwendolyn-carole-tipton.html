  <title>The Prayor: One Who Prays - Gwendolyn Carole Tipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gwendolyn Carole Tipton has done a hard, painful task of finding many beautiful Bible verses and creating honest, lovely prayers to go with them. The breadth of the prayers may inspire you to write from your heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible verses and prayers are in keeping with Philippians 4:6Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the Bible verses were taken from the Holy Bible, New International Version, Womens Devotional Bible (Zondervan, 1994).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 365 Bible verses and prayers that will encourage you to pen your journal of prayers at your pace, whether you write daily or weekly. Make this book last a year or several years by dating and writing when you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each Bible verse and prayer serves as a prompt to write your personal prayers. The journal writings begin with guide words: Bless, Help me to, Forgive me for, and Thank you for. These guide words keep your meditation spiritual and in keeping with your feelings and needs at that moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It works like a daily communication with God, and it takes only a few minutes to read His Word, view a brief prayer of no more than forty words to nudge you to feel his presence and endure the challenges ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edna, Louise, and Barbara Jean, her grandmother, mother, and aunt, respectively, were her original prayer warriors. They defined &lt;i&gt;The Prayor: One Who Prays&lt;/i&gt; continually.&lt;/p&gt;" />
