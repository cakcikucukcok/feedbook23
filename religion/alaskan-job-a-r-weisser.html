  <title>Alaskan Job - A. R. Weisser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its a fact: God wants you to be a great man. If the pathway to greatness seems hidden to you, as it does for many men, it doesnt need to be. Greatness is achieved through the disciplined pursuit of some very practical goals. Greatness is not achieved by feeling great or by believing you are great. Men who say and believe they value God and His will are really not uncommon. Many of us know what we should value and what we want to value and yet never turn these convictions into habits. The pursuit of greatness is contingent upon the ability to turn these passions into habits. The truth is the habits of your life are an infallible testimony of what you value. So let me ask, if your life were to undergo an activity audit, would there be compelling evidence that you spend your time investing in the things you claim to value? In this book you will discover the ten habits of Jobs life that led God to say, There is no one like him on the earth. These are described in the twenty-ninth chapter of the book of Job, where you will discover a clear and yet deeply challenging road map to greatness. If you commit to this journey, it will cost you everything. You will lose your life. But if you lose your life, you will find your life the greatest life imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
