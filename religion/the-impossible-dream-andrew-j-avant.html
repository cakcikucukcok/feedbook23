  <title>The Impossible Dream - Andrew J Avant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God has placed a dream inside of each of us. Paul is saying in 1 Corinthians 2:9 that we cannot even imagine or comprehend, naturally speaking, the things God has prepared for us. He has a marvelous destiny planned just each one of us. It is so unique that He says no eye has seen it nor ear heard it. The dream God reveals to our hearts will be different for everyone, depending on individual gifts, talents and abilities.
Dreams are the wellspring of passion. They capture the imagination and engage the spirit. They are capable of lifting us to new heights and helping us break through our self-imposed limitations.
God-given dreams are the seeds of greatness.When there is no clear-cut direction or goal for which to live, human beings feel purposeless.
Theres not a person on this planet who was born without an ability to do something well. Its up to each one of us to find out what that ability is, tap into it, and then pursue it with everything that is in us. We ere called to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. One of the keys to being conformed to His image is finding Gods plan for your life and doing itregardless of the cost.
 Our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has given us all goals and assignments. 
But even with the combination of right goals, sincerity, and zeal we do not always accomplish
goals.  In our endeavors too often we either have no sense of strategy or we use the wrong
strategy. The strategy in the life of Jesus Christ is a strong emphasis on the cost of discipleship.
Jesus seemed to spend more time warning men of trials and difficulties than he did urging them
to follow him. The cost of discipleship means there is a price that one must pay to go further in
God. Christianity is a challenge. What is it that you have always dreamed of doing, what is that
you have always desired to accomplish in the Lord?  The things we seek after in God are not out
of reach, but they dont just come to us, even though God is no respecter of persons and He is
ready to do the extraordinary, the remarkable, and the rare in every believers life. Though it may
surprise you, the richest deposits on our planet lie just a few blocks from your house. They rest in
your local cemetery or graveyard. Buried beneath the soil within the walls of those sacred
grounds are dreams that never came to pass, songs that were never sung, books that were never
written, paintings that never filled a canvas, ideas that never were shared, visions that never
became a reality, inventions that never went beyond the drawing board the mind and purposes
that were never fulfilled. Our graveyards are filled with potential that remained potential.
I will endeavor in this book, meet the challenge set forth by The Word of God." />
