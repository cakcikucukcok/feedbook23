  <title>O.D. out of Darkness - Bonita Byrd Williams, Alton Allen Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a story of a man-child in God&#39;s Promised Land who grew under His protection and favor while in complete ignorance of His dominion, power, and authority. It is the biography of a young man who came of age during the Civil Rights era who rose from a working class upbringing, skirting drugs and violence to become the first African-American optometrist, O.D. (Doctor of Optometry), in the state of Delaware. This is the odyssey of one man&#39;s ascent to the upper echelons of black society only to find it was void of the true meaning he was seeking out of life. Finally, it is the tracing of the finger of God through the life of an ordinary man who found his way through salvation to his Father God, and his true purpose for being, service in the great commission, that is, to seek and to save those who are lost.&lt;/p&gt;
