  <title>The Lamplighter Illumination - Ll Downing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This third work is a presentation concerned with religious dogma and the many formal world-religions, their impacts on societal concepts and conduct,  a review of scientific-conflict with formal religious dictates, and a search for the creators religious guidance for humankind.  Understanding that the author has given due consideration to unharnessed superstition, the numeral 3 has been assumed to be a symbol of good luck, consequently, this discussion aspires to positively effect, in a significant manner, at least one third (base 3) of its readers.
	The first third of any readership is undoubtedly firmly entrenched in their respective Religious followings and their life styles, and it is presumed that they will not be giving serious consideration to the materials presented here.
	The second group of readers are believed to be more open minded, and will weigh the references to the religious and scientific milestones that have occurred throughout our Age of Enlightenment and also very early and contemporary times, and that these readers will consider the negative impacts on mankind and world history that religious dogma and world religions have made. This group of readers may be too firmly entrenched in conventional religious beliefs to consider changing their faiths and life styles, however.
	The third group of readers are people dissatisfied with familiar religious and faith concepts, at least up to this point in their lives, and consequently are more receptive, or even actively seeking a new philosophy for facing their world experiences with confidence and happiness, that they have a serious concern for improving humankinds future, and that they are receptive to following Gods messaged Path." />
