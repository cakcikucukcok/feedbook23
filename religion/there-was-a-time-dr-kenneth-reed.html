  <title>There Was a Time - Dr. Kenneth Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kyle Hayden has been the pastor of the Crofington Living Water church for over five years. He has delivered the same condemning message that has met with the approval of the congregation for the entirety of that time. In spite of the approval he receives with his shallow messages, Kyle has been questioning if that is all there is to ministry, keeping a few narrow-minded people happy with bigoted preaching. Not only is Kyle questioning his ministry, he is also holding a secret, a secret he is not even willing to let himself know or at least admit. If he acknowledges and reveals this deeply hidden part of himself, how will it affect his ministry, his children, the community he serves, but most importantly his wife? Rev. Hayden has to make a decision for authenticity before he can effectively move forward in Gods plan, but is there any moving forward authentically in Gods plan when the dark secret he holds can undo any hopes he has for the future?" />
