  <title>And One Pill Makes You Small: Overcoming Fear With Facts and Faith - Randy Crenshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Americans are using more medical services every year, but as many as half of those services do nothing to improve their health. For many, the alarming rise in health care costs is stretching family budgets to the breaking point. This book challenges the notion that more medical care is always better.  A clearer understanding of the health benefits--and the risks--of the most widely prescribed drugs and the most commonly performed procedures will enable you to evaluate your doctors&#39; recommendations in a new light. For example, before you go to see your doctor, you can learn the answers to questions like: What is the exact probability that taking a statin drug will protect me from a heart attack? Does spinal surgery relieve back pain better than rehabilitation programs? Using examples from real patients, you will learn how to steer the conversation with your doctors to be sure your questions are answered and your preferences respected.  Finally, if you read this book you will be reminded of the Bible&#39;s message about life on earth and life after death--and you will see a clear contrast between that message and what the world is saying." />
