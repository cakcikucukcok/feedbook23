  <title>Revealing the Antichrist - B. Nehemiah Aiken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Secretly embedded into the very essence of the democracy and freedom we cherish, the shocking truth of the antichrists presence among us is only one death away from again being silenced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christ had released all souls from Sheol, but Lucifer, Satan, and Beelzebubthe prince of hellremains convinced of Gods flawed invincibility, and are bent on destroying all humans in the final conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Benson is a chance seer, but the world hinges on the verge of a cosmic catastrophe as he flees into a bloody trail of despair, death, and destruction. Heinous demon-angels, even Satan himself if he must, are intent on killing him before he can reveal the true identity of the antichrist. In a perilous journey taking him from the savagery of hells prisons, and its legions of demons, Benjamin is aided by one good angel as he fights desperately to alert millions of latter-day humans to the stealthy deception of the antichrist, and the cruel tortures of the sixth hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-sought identity of the antichrist is revealed in this provocative work of religious fiction. Chillingly, the best thing to have happened for the peaceful coexistence of mankind is now set to cause his most treacherous downfall. Even the worlds great religions have gladly taken the mark of the beast. Already, millions of believers have been deceived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this end-of-days turn of events, Satan and Beelzebub remains convinced of Gods flawed invincibility and hosts of demon-angels and left-behind humans are being readied for the final conflict.&lt;/p&gt;" />
