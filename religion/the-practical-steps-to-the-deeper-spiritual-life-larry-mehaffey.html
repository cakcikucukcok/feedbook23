  <title>The Practical Steps to the Deeper Spiritual Life - Larry Mehaffey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In attempting to more effectively communicate the principles of spiritual life to those who sincerely desire a deeper reality in their walk with Christ, I have discovered that most people appreciate practical and straightforward instructions, and this is especially true when it involves the mystical nature of spiritual life. Although spiritual life is not meritoriously attained through natural means or human effort, there are several Practical Steps that can be taken to help facilitate the practice of spiritual disciplines. The combination of these Practical Steps with the spiritual disciplines themselves will work to promote a dynamic life of faith that will effectively bring the believer into a productive and rewarding relationship with God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Man is an intentional creation of divine wisdom explicitly designed to fulfill a sacred purpose: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Agape love requires a soul to empty the wealth of its humanity upon the altar of God as a willing sacrifice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; If determination is to live up to its potential in promoting the spiritual life , it must be united with some very fundamental practical steps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Heaven should not be a culture shock to the consciousness of the believer; it should be a gradual final step into the glorious reality of a spiritual life whose progress began at conversion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Divine pleasure must be the goal of human effort, not divine favor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The genuineness of what we actually believe is nowhere so obviously exposed as in our daily schedules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It does not take overtly carnal acts to corrupt the days of a mans life, for inattention and idleness produce the same result as evil actions or wicked intentions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Liberty must always precede service if either are to be authentic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It is our great love for the Father, not our initial desire for salvation, that motivates and liberates the sincere believer to live a life of chosen obedience to God &lt;/p&gt;" />
