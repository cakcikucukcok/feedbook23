  <title>Window of Grace - Valanna McCurry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Window of Grace displays the love of God and His people when tragedy strikes. A mother must climb out of a second-story window of a townhouse onto the slanted roof, walk across the roof, and climb through another second-story window to find her daughter has passed away. As she experiences the overwhelming sadness of a deceased thirty-three-year-old daughter, she explains over forty-one occurrences of the Lords intervention. Included in the interventions is an EMT on sight, a basket of love, a thirty-fourth birthday party, and a vision of heaven. The chapter Letters of Love is letters she received from the EMT himself and other women who have experienced a similar tragedy. These letters of love contain so much sincerity and pouring out of love and compassion that your heart tenders as you see how this mother is embraced. She attends a Night of Remembrance, where she places a dove on a Christmas tree in honor of her daughter. That dove with her daughters name on it is now a new Christmas tradition on her own Christmas tree. She tells how she managed the first Christmas holiday without her daughter. At the Celebration of Life for her daughter, the unexpected surprises she learns about her daughter are overwhelming. She realizes she did not know her daughter as she thought she did. The burden of a second tragedy strikes when she receives the shocking news from the medical examiner explaining the cause of death. The raw emotion revealed in Window of Grace sustains healing by the love of the Lord and His people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
