  <title>Soaring Above the Ashes on the Wings of Forgiveness - Kitty Chappell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I finally realized that no matter how much I wanted to, I could not protect my family. Though I daydreamed of ways for us to escape, I knew it was impossible. Dad had warned us too many times to not go mouthing off to anyone about things that are none of their business, or I&amp;#39;ll put you all out of your misery. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The oldest of three, Kitty Chappell did her best to shield her brother and sister from their fathers abuse, but little could stand in the way of his beatings and vicious remarks. None of them escaped his brutality. As a well-respected family man in their Texas community in the 1950s, her father enjoyed a sure confidence in his control over his family. His assurance proved correct when he attacked her mother and turned friends against her, aiming shocking accusations at his wife and daughter. Everyone thought her father was wonderful including the jury that gave him the minimum sentence for trying to kill Kitty&amp;#39;s mother as she lay sleeping. Only three-and-a-half years for premeditated attempted murder! It just wasn&amp;#39;t fair. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kitty loved God but disagreed with Him on the subject of forgiveness. Many people were in her corner, for who hasn&amp;#39;t debated this issue with God? She didn&amp;#39;t want to forgive, she wanted revenge! But as Kitty developed her relationship with Christ, she realized she needed to forgive the man who had caused her so much pain. Soaring Above the Ashes on the Wings of Forgiveness will keep you riveted to your seat with its twists and turns. You will be enraged and terrified with the author through her difficult journey. Ultimately, you will rejoice with her as she walks through the door of forgiveness and breathes in the fresh air of freedom. Soaring Above the Ashes on Wings of Forgiveness reveals Kittys remarkable story of courage and faith and how she developed the attitude that enabled her to overcome rather than merely survive. This touching story will inspire you to overcome your difficulties and experience your own freedom and joy as you learn to forgive when everything in you screams for revenge." />
