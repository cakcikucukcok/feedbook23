  <title>The Power of the Anointing - Evangelist Virginia Sutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Power of the Anointing: 
The Burden Remover and Yoke Destroyer
by Evangelist Virginia Sutton
Finally, after eight years of praying, fasting, and warfare against the powers of darkness, it is finished: my first book about the anointing.
I began to write on October 8, 2002, and finished June 16, 2010. 
     	To write about the anointing was not easy because Satan knows this is one sure weapon that will put him out of business: this is why he constantly tries to set traps for those that are sold out to GOD and are walking in the anointing that has been placed upon their lives.
You see, the anointing is your divine spiritual authority in the spirit that has been delegated down to us from the Lord. Therefore, the anointing is GODS holy Power, Presence, and SPIRIT upon man/woman for the purpose of not only to live holy but to also tear down the kingdom of Satan and build up the kingdom of God. 
The anointing enables, enhances, and equips in order to whip the powers of darkness: 
Sinful yokes are destroyed because of the anointing; therefore, the devil is not alarmed over talent, which only pricks the emotions. However, he is alarmed over the anointing, which pricks the heart of man and causes him to cry out, What must I do to be saved?
Acts 2:3738 
Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? 
Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." />
