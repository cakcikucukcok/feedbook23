  <title>Miscarried Souls - Lorraine Elizabeth Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miscarriage is a taboo word. To discuss such a loss makes many people extremely uncomfortable. As a result, it is all too frequently swept under the carpet, leaving the sufferer feeling desperately alone with their grief.
The author is passionate about bringing awareness to the silent suffering endured and invites you to join her on a journey exploring the darkest days of grief and pain, to the beginning of the healing process.
Lorraine was initially dismissive when her miscarried child attempted to attract his mothers attention from the afterlife. Fortunately, her son was not about to give up. With the help of several gifted mediums and a few tricks of his own, this tenacious soul has proven his undeniable existence
from the other side. He has also initiated communication with many family members in spirit and uncovered a previously unknown relative.
Babies lost in the womb have never actually been lost at all, even those taken at the earliest gestation. They remain safe, blissfully content, and incredibly close to their parents." />
