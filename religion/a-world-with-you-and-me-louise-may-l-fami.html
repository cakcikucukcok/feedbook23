  <title>A World with You and Me - Louise May L. Fami</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To describe life&#39;s wonderful imperfection, I wrote this book as if I&#39;m just writing a simple and ordinary letter using a pen and paper. I imagine writing without any spell check or grammar check on. I wrote the book A World With You And Me because my dream is to be a part of a ministry.  My goal is to write letters most especially for those people who didn&#39;t know how to express their thoughts in a hope that I will be able to help them say what they need to say like how some people encourage me to express myself. I wrote the letters using my simple writing style. Just imagine that my book is a huge mailbox with a lot of letters in it. I used the concept of writing letters because I believe that simple words of encouragement is a way to touch everyone&#39;s hearts. Writing this book is like a long journey. I shared everything that I&#39;ve learned from this life since I was young until I became an adult. I wrote everything that I learned from the news, on tv, on the radio, in school, while traveling and everything that I&#39;ve learn from my family, friends, from my influences, from different artist and even from strangers.
In my letters to God, I talked to him about what happened to the world, when the problems of the world started, and the reasons why the world is always giving him the blame whenever bad things happen in their lives. In my letters to the world, I wrote letters for all of you and believe it or not?? Even for myself. I propose a happy change. It is composed of my little suggestion or solution to the problems of the world and my ideas to create change. I wrote a letter to parents, fishermen, illegal loggers, abled and disabled people, drivers, doctors, lawyers, young adults, broken and happy families, lovers, friends, and all people who are seeking an inspiration and reason for living. 
In the conclusion of the book, I wrote an advance thank-you letter to God and imagined that the world heard me out and granted my proposed happy change. I also wrote this book for people who are a  part of a ministry, teachers, writers, artist and all those people who might grant my request to reach out to many people and start a project like what is written in the book. I wrote simple suggestions like for writers, writing a beautiful story on how to solve a math problem for those students who are having a hard time in school. For musicians, asking them to write more songs to make  relationships work instead of breaking up. I also wrote a letter asking people to make a car for visually impaired people like me and a lot more!
The book is a piece of enlightenment so the reader is not only drawn into the purpose why it was written but to the idea of considering making a happy change to their own lives." />
