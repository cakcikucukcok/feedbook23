  <title>Ghosties and Ghoulies and Long-Legged Beasties and Things That Go Bump in the Night - Donald E. Post</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In matters of faith we generally accept what parents, Sunday school teachers, friends or ministers tell us. That was certainly the story of my youth and early years in the ministry. Given the fact that such matters are non-scientific and un-testable by traditional scientific means and that there is a wide range of Christian beliefs it is perfectly understandable that people are either puzzled or uninterested when trying to make sense of it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Ghosties &amp; Ghoulies&lt;/I&gt; peels away the extraneous ideological debris that encumbers so much Christen thought in order to more clearly reveal the historic God-man Mystery. People daring to live an honest intellectual life in the 21st Century cannot do so carrying around a medieval theology.&lt;/p&gt;
A Christological thread seeks to tie &lt;I&gt;Ghosties &amp; Ghoulies&lt;/I&gt; together. Minimally I hope my thoughts and observations will make one&#39;s study of Christianity easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Undoubtedly some will find a few of their taken-for-granted Christian views challenged. We all need to pull up our theological ideas by the roots from time to time and rethink them. Much of our contemporary Christian beliefs are hand-me-downs from medieval lore and superstition.&lt;/p&gt;" />
