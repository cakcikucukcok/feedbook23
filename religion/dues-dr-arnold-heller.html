Dues: The Coming of Allie Cohen
God sends a Messiah who does not fly through the air, walk on water, or hurl lightning and thunderbolts. The mission of the Lords Einstein of human relations is to teach the people how to live in peace and freedom by embracing human virtues of mutual trust, cooperation, and love. The people are challenged by the Almighty to behold and exalt the prophet and collectively follow in a common state of awe. But will they really see, hear, or listen to him?
Dr. Allie Cohen, a successful educator, develops a statistically valid prejudice reduction treatment for global application. Allie is married to Sarah, his beloved angel of the hearth. He also writes The Lesson, a best-selling novel that is made into a Holocaust-themed film. Meteoric success begins driving a wedge into Allies idyllic life with his beautiful red-haired wife, a gifted educational specialist.
God commissions Allie by teaming him with Carole Herman, the most popular Jewish actress and singer in the worldhis angel of beholding. Carole falls in love with Allie; he joins her on a goodwill tour for President Reagan and becomes a global force for justice and compassion. The peace missions, though, tug at Allies bond with his family.
As Allies importance and influence grow, strains between him and Carole form just as his family stabilizes. Things worsen with Carole when Allie switches from direct action for improving human welfare to growing a huge philanthropic fortune for direct investment in the lives of the poor and oppressed.
In the end, God and special angel Gabriel, the narrator, empower Allie to transform Atlanta into a model metropolis for all citizens. A rainbow cast full of colorful characters and their dreams intersect with Allie Cohen and drive the explosive conclusion.
Dues: The Coming of Allie Cohen is an almost biblical love story that will make us laugh, cry, and take stock of our lives. The author takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster and exciting trip around the world that will leave them thinking about where America is headed as a society and how the world is evolving." />
