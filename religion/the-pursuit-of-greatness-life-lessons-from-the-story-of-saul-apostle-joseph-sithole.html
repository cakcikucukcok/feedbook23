  <title>The Pursuit of Greatness: Life Lessons from the Story of Saul - Apostle Joseph Sithole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE PURSUIT OF GREATNESS seeks to take every Christina through their journey to their God-anointed destiny. It is a set of steps followed from the life of the first King of Israel, Saul and the relationship that he had with his father.   In this book, Apostle Sithole shows how God uses the relationship of a father/mentor and son/mentee to systematically take one to their destiny.. He highlights the importance of both the good and the bad of such relationships and how the positive response thereof can catapult one to their greatness.  He also points out the importance of surrounding one&#39;s self with supportive and loyal people; especially those recommended by their father/mentor.  In a time where the Body of Christ is plagued by the spirit of the rebellion and defiance, this book is an invaluable tool that will help those who are called into the LORD&#39;s service to endure instruction and coaching by those God has placed in their lives for such purpose." />
