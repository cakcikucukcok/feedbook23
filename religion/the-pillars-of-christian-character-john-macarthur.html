  <title>The Pillars of Christian Character - John MacArthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;To love [God] with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ndash;Jesus&#39; words in Mark 12:33&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Without question the crucial issue in living the Christian life is the condition of your heart. Actions may be temporarily deceiving, but ultimately our outward behavior will reflect what&#39;s inside, because our internal attitudes form who we really are. Those inner attitudes are also what God deems most important.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this book one of Christianity&#39;s most respected Bible teachers and pastors examines the foundational attitudes, or &quot;pillars,&quot; of Christian character as outlined in God&#39;s Word. Pillars such as genuine faith, obedience, humility, selfless love, forgiveness, self-discipline, gratitude, and worship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To some degree each trait, on its own, marks a person as one of God&#39;s own and reveals an active, living faith. Each is an essential element of mature Christianity. But there is transforming power when you combine them in your everyday living as God commands. Your character will be grounded in godliness; you will see things from an eternal perspective; and your faith, your actions, your witness to others will be revitalized from the inside out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
