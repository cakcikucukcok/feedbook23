  <title>Rowvotions Volume 17 - Ben Mathes, Karin Clack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to serve; realizing that it is their country, their people, their village, but our problem. We will never do for others what they can do for themselves, but will work in a partnership based upon mutual love, grace, and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Dr. Ben Mathes, president, Rivers of the World&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivers of the World (ROW) is a not-for-profit Christian ministry that targets remote river basins. Our goal is to serve with people who live in these river basins and those we serve determine our projects. We ask them what makes up their greatest challenges and covenant with them to meet and overcome those challenges together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROW emphasizes that it is their country, their village, their culture, but our problem. Our goal is to serve in an atmosphere of mutual concern and respect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ROW projects run the gamut of human, physical and spiritual needs. Academics, research, education and medical/dental concerns go  hand-in-hand with church planting, construction, evangelism and Bible distribution.&lt;/p&gt;" />
