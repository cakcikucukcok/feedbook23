  <title>Death and its Reality - Idp Research Division</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We have been brought to this life by the will of the Giver and Initiator of life, and we will leave this life when the One Who gave us the soul decides to take it away. People will come and others will go, but when we look closely at this we discover the secret behind this continual process of life and death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In this book, all that happens after death, when people enter their graves, what happens beneath the grave, etc has been reported from the Qur&amp;#39;an and Ahadeeth. The reports whose chains are not authentic, and cannot be proven to have come from the Messenger (S) have been ignored. Also ignored are the methodology of those who reject the idea of accepting authentic ahadeeth if they are ahaad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, those who twist the meanings of the texts, those who took their minds as judges to judge the texts and who turned things in reverse order and made the judge subject to judgement. They went astray and led others astray. In some cases they went so far as to reject many issues of the Hereafter which are proven in authentic reports, based on rational analogies which, had they examined them closely, would have realized their absurdity. Had they pondered the matters of the Hereafter in any depth, they would have realized that the Hereafter is a different world, and that the standards and measures of the Hereafter are different from those of this world. We have discussed this important dogmatic principle - one of the basic Islamic doctrine, at length.&lt;br /&gt;
