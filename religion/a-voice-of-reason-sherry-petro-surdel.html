  <title>A Voice of Reason - Sherry Petro-Surdel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What you are about to read began in my heart and found its way to hand written words on 3-ring note book paper. These thoughts that turn into the spoken word I call Reasonings. The words were often spoken to a small group of seekers. Churches often call them sermons or messages, but I call them Reasonings in reference to a biblical passage in Isaiah 1:18: Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord. This infers to me that it is a co-creation experience. I also appreciate the Rasta spiritual perspective that calls this co-creation process Reasonings to understand (or as Rastafarians say, to overstand) the ways of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
