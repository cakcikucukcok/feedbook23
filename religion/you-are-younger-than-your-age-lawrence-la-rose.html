  <title>You Are Younger Than Your Age - Lawrence La Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world is blindfolded by two systems known as the lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar, and both are giving inaccurate timelines for archaeological discoveries, radiocarbon dating and your actual age. You Are Younger than Your Age seeks to clarify any doubts about your actual age and the age of the other worlds. It offers comprehensive information about creationism and spirituality, as well as the functioning of the other distinctive worlds. For example, Jerusalem is situated in the center of Africa and not the Middle East as previously thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide is simple to follow and guides you to an understanding of the twenty-one-year cycle of the moon and sun. It portrays accurate facts, calendars, charts, and figures. There is no climate change or global warming. The Antarctica is not completely mapped, and a new crafted world map is urgently needed. Changes mean hope for future generations. The book is supported by the scriptures in the Bible, and it is full of comprehensive information about creationism and spirituality. Finally, it can lead you to the beacon of a divine light.&lt;/p&gt;" />
