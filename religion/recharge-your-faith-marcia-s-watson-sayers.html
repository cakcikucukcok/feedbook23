  <title>Recharge Your Faith - Marcia S. Watson-Sayers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life has more ups than downs, ups of crisis after crisis with minimal opportunity to balance yourself. Without any invitation, stress kicks in, and depression makes itself comfortable and homey because your faith fuel ran low. You begin to doubt as experiences of the past flood your mind and cross over into your soul. Your spirit begins to droop and becomes deficient. When your fuel is low, you cannot travel your destined course, so you get off track and compromise because of fear. To get back on track, you have to recharge your faith. 
Dont let negativity control your life. If you cannot get a positive reaction from a negative action, then it belongs in the trash disposal. Take back control of your life. Recharge your faith so your hope will be strengthened. Dont let the past navigate your future. Let your faith stand out and reflect the glory of the Son, like the sunflower reflects the rays of the sun. 
This book is a tool to help you maintain your salvation, keep your faith alive, and help you utilize the potentials you were given at birth to glorify God/ Elohim/Yahweh. Recharge your faith so you can impact the world." />
