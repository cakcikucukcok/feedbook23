  <title>The Bluebonnet Child: Finding Grace in Poor Soil - Meggie Lee Calvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Bluebonnet flower grows in very poor soil. One would never guess this truth but the bright, proud bonnets tell no lies. Not even the unkempt soil can keep a Bluebonnet from producing its lovely blossoms.  People can be similar to the Bluebonnet flower. They are born into poor soil and have to live with the challenges presented to them. Kids from neglectful or abusive families are Bluebonnet children.  We are trained in children&#39;s and family ministry that the parent is the primary faith nurturer. But what happens to a child who does not have a healthy parent to nourish them?  Whether you serve in a school, nonprofit program, or the local church, this book will equip you with helpful tools and inspire you with hope-filled stories. While the tale of the Bluebonnet child is heavy, in Christ there is hope. He is counting on you to shower them with the healing waters of His grace as they bloom through life." />
