  <title>The Mightiest Hoax in the History of Mankind - Johannes J.D Villion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Mightiest Hoax in the History of Mankind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is recommended Reading for Students of Comparative Religion. and anyone interested in the truth, as it Deciphers Truth from Falsehood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until the 16th Century there were no translations of the Bible in English .When Tyndale translated the Bible into English he was declared a heretic, was hunted down and eventually strangled and burnt to death on October 6th, 1536. We can only conclude that this act of the Church was done because when the people read and under stood what was written in the Bible they refused to believe it as the Word of God. In similar manner, when Galileo invented the telescope and concluded that the world was round and revolved around the sun, he was also declared a heretic and killed as this theory (which later proved to be a fact) went against the teachings of the Bible that propounded the belief that the earth was flat and stationery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eusebius and other Church fathers, it is reasonable to believe, would not hesitate to make what alterations were necessary in the writings and records of the cult to bring them into line with the creeds they produced. Honesty and accuracy, as we understand them, did not exist in those days. For three hundred years prior to Nicaea no historical records existed, so there was no great difficulty in deluding the people as to the past story of the cult. Anything could be added to or subtracted from its past beliefs without undue comment. J. Arthur Findlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you have it, from the pens of learned CHRISTIAN SCHOLARS that the present Bible is the work of ordinary men and can never be divine. What additional proof could any intelligent person need to disqualify every Bible in existence as the word of God in any language! Can any sensible person argue with such irrefutable evidence?&lt;/p&gt;" />
