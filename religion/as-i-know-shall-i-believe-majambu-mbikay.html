  <title>As I Know, Shall I Believe - Majambu Mbikay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a collection of short essays that I wrote between 2000 and 2004 for a quarterly catholic magazine of Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It contains opinions and thoughts that I was given the chance to share with my community of origin and faith - and with many others, as I understand - on various topics of interest to the African, the Congolese, the Canadian, the scientist and the believer that I am. As one, these different facets of mine held the pen that crafted these words. These words are a partial and passing reflection of my multiple quests for understanding, from the Congo of my birth and youth, to my adoptive Canada where I now live. They contain no eternal truth. There are mere expressions of my lifelong inclination to ignore appearances, and to search, through the noisy claims of certainty, the vast unknown still to be explored." />
