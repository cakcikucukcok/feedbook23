  <title>The Choreography of God - Ceu M. Kingshill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Each chapter has been prayerfully and soberly written. This book has a biblically centered, practical and applicable approach to the concerns of Praise/Dance Worship encounters for the twenty-first century, a time that sometimes can be eclipsed by self-centeredness, personal gains, and the pride of ministry leaders. This book doesn&#39;t just unpack the problem and dangers facing the ministers and audience of these encounters but provides solutions and a thoughtful meditation that delves into the heart of this amazing ministry we have come to love throughout the body of Christ. After reading and editing this book and studying the Scriptures presented, I have noticed that I have become more reflective, cognizant, and obedient to God&#39;s purposes, or as Sister Ceu would say, the Choreography of God in my own life, a choreography that is beautiful organized and developed by the one and only God who knows us in our entirety.
