  <title>The End of the Anglo-Saxon Age and the Coming of the Anti-Christ - Richard Gentry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The End of the Anglo-Saxon Age and the Coming of the Anti-Christ&lt;/em&gt; describes the history of the earth as illuminated in the Bible, particularly the last quarter-millenium and Revelation. There will be about 6,000 years of earths history before Daniels final or seventieth week of seven biblical years and then Christs millennial Sabbath. Each thousand year period roughly corresponds with a day of creation. At the end of the sixth millennial day--i.e. the last 250 years--man came forth as represented by the Anglo-Saxon nations who are the descendants of the two sons of Joseph, who had Gods birthright blessings, which would be enormous. Jacob prophesied that his younger grandson would become a multitude of nations, followed by the older grandson becoming a great nation. During this time, Britain became Great, producing Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Britain had a vibrant Christian population beginning in the late 1780s, and Americas beginnings were clearly Christian. No two nations have ever been blessed so much. When evolution finally supplanted the God of the Bible, Britain lost her Empire. God then raised up America until she, too, followed Britains downward path. According to the Bible, the Anglo-Saxons must return to Israel. Hence, the standard of living in both America and Britain must soon rapidly decline, and, at the same time, Israel must become a much more desirable destination; Israel must destroy its surrounding enemies, which the Bible details. However, these great victories only set up the 1,260-day Great Tribulation, ending with Christs return.&lt;/p&gt;" />
