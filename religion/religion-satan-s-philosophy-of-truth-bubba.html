I am sixty-five years old and a common man in my walk with Christ. I was a little slow in the beginning, but now, after thirty-five years, I have been running to catch up with Him. Why am I running? Time is of great importance. No matter how young or old we are, we just never know how much time we have in this world. Please read what I have learned from the Word of God and the knowledge He will give us. You may or may not agree with all my views and opinions. After all, I am just a common man. What I do promise youthis book will open your eyes and hearts! It will give you an incentive to seek God diligently! No matter what religion we may follow, we must seek Him diligently!" />
