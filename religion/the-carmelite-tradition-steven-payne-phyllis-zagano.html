  <title>The Carmelite Tradition - Steven Payne, Phyllis Zagano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight hundred years ago, Albert of Jerusalem gave the hermit-penitents of Mount Carmel a way of life to follow. Since then, this rule has inspired and formed mystics and scholars, men and women, lay and ordained to seek the living God. In &lt;i&gt;The Carmelite Tradition&lt;/i&gt; Steven Payne, OCD, brings together representative voices to demonstrate the richness and depth of Carmelite spirituality. As he writes, Carmelite spirituality seeks nothing more nor less than to &#39;stand before the face of the living God&#39; and prophesy with Elijah, to &#39;hear the word of God and keep it&#39; with Mary, to grow in friendship with God through unceasing prayer with Teresa, to &#39;become by participation what Christ is by nature&#39; as John of the Cross puts it, and thereby to be made, like Therase of Lisieux, into instruments of God&#39;s transforming merciful love in the church and society.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lives and writings in &lt;i&gt;The Carmelite Tradition&lt;/i&gt; invite readers to stand with these holy men and women and seek God in the hermitage of the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Steven Payne, OCD, of the Washington Province of Discalced Carmelite Friars, is a member of the Carmelite Friars&#39; formation team at the Monastery of St. John of the Cross near Nairobi, Kenya, and director of the Institute of Spirituality and Religious Formation (ISRF) at Tangaza College, a constituent college of the Catholic University of Eastern Africa (CUEA) in Nairobi. He is the past editor of ICS Publications and of &lt;/i&gt;Spiritual Life&lt;i&gt; magazine and the author of several works in philosophy of religion, theology, and Carmelite spirituality. He is a member of the Carmelite Forum and of the Carmelite Institute in Washington DC, of which he is a past president. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&quot;&lt;/div&gt;" />
