      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Donna Friend has developed a workbook on breaking free from food addiction that is both completely Biblical and incredibly practical. This tremendous resource will not only prove valuable to individuals seeking victory over eating disorders, but also to pastors, counselors, and family members who are trying to provide support for those struggling with these afflictions.&quot; Pastor Steve Rahter - Praise Tabernacle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book takes a whole different approach to the issue of losing weight permanently.

This book offers a step-by-step approach to tearing down the spiritual and emotional strongholds that have been developing over a lifetime to give the reader freedom in the area of food bondage. As the reader works through this book chapter by chapter, he or she will begin to ask themselves, Can it really be this easy? When the Holy Spirit is your partner, the answer is, Absolutely, a resounding Yes! The author hopes that many will be released from the bondage of having their days focused on food and weight loss to walking in freedom forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
