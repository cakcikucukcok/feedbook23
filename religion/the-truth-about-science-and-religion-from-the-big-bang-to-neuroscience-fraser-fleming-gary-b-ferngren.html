  <title>The Truth about Science and Religion: From the Big Bang to Neuroscience - Fraser Fleming, Gary B. Ferngren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Religion has influenced the development of science over the past two millennia. The Truth about Science and Religion tells the story of their interaction. The book examines the origin of the universe, evolutionary processes, Christian beliefs, the history of science, what being human really means, and what science and religion have to say about these ideas.   The Truth about Science and Religion is designed to help explore personal views on science and religion, offering questions for discussion at the end of each chapter. The book provides the historical and scientific background and the philosophical insight needed to think through issues of science and religion and their influences on personal beliefs. Metaphors, analogies, and comparisons are used to simplify complex topics so that any reader can engage with the key concepts. Unlike other books in this field, The Truth about Science and Religion follows a chronological scheme, treating increasingly personal topics as the book moves through cosmology, evolution, the life of Jesus, and the lives of several great scientists to regain a unified view of science and religion in today&#39;s world." />
