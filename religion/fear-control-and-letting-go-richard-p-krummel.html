  <title>Fear, Control, and Letting Go - Richard P. Krummel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do your fears and anxieties get in the way of living a spirit-filled life? Have you ever been victim to the illusion of control? Are you looking for spiritual recovery and personal growth? Are compulsions interfering in your relationships with others and with God?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do you have the peace that you want?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;While completing more than forty thousand hours of psychotherapy over thirty years, with individuals, couples, and families, Dr. Krummel realized that the fears, roles, and themes in his life were not unique. He became aware that his psychological and spiritual journey was a common one.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Richard Krummels new book, Fear, Control, and Letting Go: How Psychological Principles and Spiritual Faith Can Help Us Recover from Our Fears offers life-changing tools for recovery and transformation. The book provides tremendous insight into how one can grow behaviorally, emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;While you are waiting for someone or something else to change, change yourself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Krummel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Give as you are able, according as the Lord has blessed you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Deuteronomy 16:17)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dr. Krummel donates $1.00 from the sale of each book to several charities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
