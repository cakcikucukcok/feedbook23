  <title>Healing on the Battle Line - Sheri A. Taggart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Battle is Real- Choose a Side!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this second journey of the healing series, we will get to know the Holy Spirit in a more intimate way. Being lukewarm is not an option! We will also discover the many ways that Satan can come against us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a book of spiritual strategies, offering hope and healing. We are reminded that God has given us weapons to stand against any evil ploy that comes against us, as we learn to seal the footholds in our life that might be inviting the enemy into our life, without even realizing it. We will learn how to be good soldiers for Christ, prepared for battleable to bounce back from anything that is thrown our way. Its time to enjoy complete healing in Jesus as we fight the good fight in victory!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book has been a blessing to have by my side as Im battling cancer! I know that I am not alone in my daily struggles of life.&lt;/p&gt;
