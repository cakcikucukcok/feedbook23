He proved that set-backs do not always deny one success. He played the card of care for his father to survive. He made his father his hero as long as he lived and it paid-off greatly. He identified the land allotted to him which he claimed Gods help to claim from the original inhabitants. He started life as a hunter and ended as a successful shepherd when he took over his fathers flocks.
