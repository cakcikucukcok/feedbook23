  <title>The Shrink Wrapped Armor of God - Kathy Barton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;This book is a collection of the wisdom gained from 30 years of working as a Christian counselor. Many people struggle with the same problems year after year and only seem to get temporary relief from self-destructive behavior and thought patterns that undermine their happiness and lessen their quality of life. But by taking wisdom from the Bible and applying it in practical, life-changing ways, you can become a new person, free from the ravages of your past. People who I have counseled often ask why, when theyve been a Christian for so long, theyve never heard these things taught. I dont know the answer to that, but I do know that now is your time to become the person youve dreamed of becoming.&lt;/P&gt;" />
