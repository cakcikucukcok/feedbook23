  <title>My Son Marries My Daughter - Dr Walter Masocha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the Kingdom of God, I came to the conclusion that, the key principle when it comes to marriage is: My Son Marries My daughter. I coined this phrase as my contribution to the world on the subject of Christian (or religious) marriages. God instructs that His children marry among themselves. Dont be horrified, this principle is not the same as incest. 2nd Corinthians 6:14 instructs that Gods children should not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. It is Gods principle. As a child of God, you violate it at your own peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the Old Testament to the New Testament, the Bible is awash with examples of those who followed this key principle and had successful marriages (e.g. Isaac and Rebecca, Jacob and Rachel, Joseph and Mary) while other examples show what happened whenever this principle was violated (e.g. Ahab and Jezebel). Our Heavenly Father wants His sons to marry His daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creation account in Genesis 1:26  28 tells us that God created Adam, His own son. Later on, out of Adam, God made His daughter, Eve. Apart from creation, Gods first official role was to conduct a marriage in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 2:18 24). That day His son Adam married His daughter, Eve. He sealed the key principle on Kingdom relationships, and in a way declared: My son marries my daughter. Thats marriage, Gods way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up the book: God started with a wedding in the garden of Eden; He is going to finish with a wedding in the clouds (1st Thess. 4:13-18), completing the full circle of this Divine principle. His only begotten son (Jesus Christ/the Bridegroom) will marry His only daughter (the Church/the Bride). Its official: My son marries my daughter, says God. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
