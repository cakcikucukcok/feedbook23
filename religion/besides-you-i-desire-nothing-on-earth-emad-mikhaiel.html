  <title>Besides You I Desire Nothing on Earth - Emad Mikhaiel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;King David has an important role in the Old and New Testaments and huge impact on the nation of Israel. The Father witnessed and said about David, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Acts 13:22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lord Jesus, Son of David, witnessed, How then does David in the Spirit call Him Lord, saying &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 22:43)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Holy Bible said about him, Look, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing, a mighty man of valor, a man of war, prudent in speech, and a handsome person; and the Lord is with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1 Samuel 16:18)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great man like that, who went through a lot in his life from being uncounted among his brothers to become a king of all Israel, who experienced distress, joy, victory, defeat, with a heart after Gods heartit is worthy to know how he, by the Holy Spirit, expressed all these feelings and put them in the psalms. This book will search that heart to bring out of his treasure things new and old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Matthew 13:52)&lt;/p&gt;" />
