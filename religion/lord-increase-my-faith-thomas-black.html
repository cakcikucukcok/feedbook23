  <title>Lord, Increase My Faith - Thomas Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During the summer of 2011, I was fervently typing chapters for the book I had begun to write, reflecting upon the words that Jesus had spoken in my vision: Start telling the stories I will give to you. Lord, Increase My Faith is an inspirational book containing these storiesreal stories that will increase the faith of the reader. They are faith stories to encourage other believers in their walk with God. These faith stories serve as a testimony to my faith, a reminder of Gods faithfulness, and, prayerfully, an encouragement to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many nonbelievers say the accounts in the Bible are just a bunch of made-up stories. Admittedly, they may say the same for the stories written in this book. But whether it was God who divided the Red Sea to allow the Israelites safe passage as told in the book of Exodus or God who protected the two children being attacked by killer bees in Nicaragua as detailed in this book, my belief that God did either of these miracles comes down to one word: faith.&lt;/p&gt;" />
