I thought about turning around more than once, but we pressed on, because the goal was to go to Huston to visit her; she was sick.   As I was coming aboard Im looking for the pilot. I want see if he was a mature looking person. I want to see a person with a little grey in his head. I want to see if he looked anything like Captain Sully. I wanted to see if he looked like someone that could land a plane on the Hudson River without crashing, What a thought! Too much clutter to communicate with God! Do you think its possible for us to have so much going on in our lives that we miss the things that are really meaningful? Do you think it is possible that we could fail in our communication with God because we have too much clutter in our lives? Jesus talked about some becoming entangled with the cares of the world that they leave the Lord (Mark 4:19). In Jesus parable of the Sower he mentions one who receives the word among thorns; thus allowing the cares of the world to choke the word making him unprofitable-&lt;/p&gt;" />
