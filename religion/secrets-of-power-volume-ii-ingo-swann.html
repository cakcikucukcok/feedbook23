  <title>Secrets of Power, Volume II - Ingo Swann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Any desire for more individual empowerment will soon encounter the question of WHAT to empower. There are many ways to consider this. One way is first to identify human power elements that are known to exist, but DO NOT receive societal nurturing, enhancement, training, scientific research, or philosophical interest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In-depth research will reveal at least five major categories of these power elements, one such category consisting of the aware powers innate in everyone of our species. The direct relationship between the spectrum of aware powers and increases of power is self-evident. The direct relationship between less or no awareness and less or no power is also self-evident.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most societal power structures do not encourage too much development of any aware and related powers, and, via societal programming of punishment, some structures force them into latency altogether. One basic reason is that too much awareness erodes the efficiency of walls of secrecy that support the elite of most power structures, whether large or small.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most are familiar with the awareness they have. But few are familiar with the awarenesses they don&amp;#39;t have, but which anyway innately exist within their otherwise amazing information systems.&lt;/p&gt;" />
