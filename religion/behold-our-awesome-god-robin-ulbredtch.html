  <title>Behold Our Awesome God! - Robin Ulbredtch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    Behold Our Awesome God, a thirteen-week Bible study, presents Gods attributes by sharing accounts of His intervention in peoples lives. Through
    provocative questions, activities, and Scripture, we can behold God and learn to apply His word to our lives.
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    Come, walk through this exciting journey! See God deliver desperate people. Behold, God, the divine Creator, loves you and wants personal relationship with
    you too!
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    I have known Robin for decades and find that she is an excellent writer. Robin is a mature Christian and her heart is toward God. Many will be enlightened
    and benefit from the God-given nuggets found within Behold Our Awesome God. He has given her an understanding of the word and allowed her to write this
    wonderful study.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    We have known Robin and Steve Ulbredtch for years. We attended the same fellowship for many years. We are blessed by their love for Jesus and willingness
    to help wherever and whenever they can. They remain committed to their church family and each other which is a good testimony of Gods work flowing through
    them to each other and their brothers and sisters in Christ. We are blessed by their perseverance to follow through and produce this Bible study which is
    set up in an easy to follow pattern with encouraging helps to memorize and study the Bible on ones own, which we wholeheartedly agree is what the world
    needs today.
