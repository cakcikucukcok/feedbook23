  <title>Men and Women in the Ministry for Christ - Hayk Hovhannisyan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Men and Women in the Ministry&lt;/i&gt; for Christ is a book that will help every disciple of Jesus to know what the Bible actually says concerning the role and the ministry of women in the body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based solely on the Word of God as presented in Hebrew and Greek texts, this book exposes the truths that are hidden in almost all English Bible versions. With great objectivity and without adding or changing the biblical texts, this book shows that women as persons are equal to men, and that they have been and can be ministers of Christ, both in leadership and in non-leadership positions.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many things have been said concerning the role and the ministry of women, but this book is very unique, because it deals with the root of the issue, which is actually found in the mistranslations of many biblical texts. An objective and careful examination of controversial passages in the original texts, shows incredible and scandalous inaccuracies in many Bible translations. The mistranslations have become the basis for the misinterpretations and misapplications of many biblical texts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book treats in detail all the verses of 1 Corinthians 11:315; 14:3435; 1 Timothy 2:1115, and other controversial passages. It treats very important subjects such as: &lt;i&gt;headship, image and glory of God, authority, silence and speaking in the church, spiritual gifts, ministries&lt;/i&gt;, etc. It also offers detailed information concerning real women in the Bible, who were entrusted with genuine ministries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the whole counsel of God, the book presents many essential truths concerning men and women that must be accepted by the entire body of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, by presenting very profound truths concerning the genuine call and the ministry that originate from God, this book offers very solid and practical information concerning true ministry for Christ. It also shows what potential leaders must do in order to enter into ministry, if they are called and empowered by God to do so.&lt;/p&gt;" />
