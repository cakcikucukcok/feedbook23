  <title>Jesus Goes to McDonald&#39;s: Theology and Consumer Society - Luiz Alexandre Solano  Rossi, Norman K. Gottwald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book demonstrates that Latin American liberation theology continues to produce substantial biblical exegesis, absorbing theological reflection, and a sharp social critique that enhances the worldwide church.  In Jesus Goes to McDonald&#39;s, Rossi asserts that the book of Job protests against the devastating effects of imperial Persian rule in postexilic Judah--effects seen as the stimulus for the theology of reward so severely criticized by Job. Not since Gustavo Gutierrez&#39;s On Job has there been such a compelling reading of the book of Job as a literary mirror of oppressive socioeconomic and political conditions. Rossi uses Job to offer a critique of the prosperity theology that is so dominant in parts of the church today. The second half of the book offers a radical critique of the McDonaldization of society and church. Free market capitalism has become an all-embracing worldview to the detriment of society and church. As counter-speech, Rossi proposes a theology that favors life, a life in which solidarity with the poor is central." />
