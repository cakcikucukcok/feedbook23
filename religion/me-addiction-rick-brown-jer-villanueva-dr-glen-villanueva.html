  <title>Me Addiction - Rick Brown, Jer Villanueva, Dr. Glen Villanueva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book weve all been wanting but didnt know we needed.&lt;br&gt;
--From the forward by Phil and Heather Joel, founders of deliberate People and formerly of Newsboys&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s an addiction.  The oldest one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has caused every human from the first person to now to navel gaze rather than God gaze. Its tagline is Whats in it for &lt;i&gt;me?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has caused families to break up, portfolios to bankrupt, and individuals to self-destruct. The addiction? The ME Addiction. Its that ingrained reaction to think of self first and others later. Sometimes much later. Its the idea that having it my way is the best way. Believing that has elevated our egos, sent us into hiding, broken our community, surfaced anxiety, and saturated us with stress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But having it my way wasnt the original way. At the beginning, the first response was to look to God. The better question was, Whats in it for him? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ME Addiction&lt;/i&gt; will help you diagnose the human condition and take steps to a better life. A life that breaks free from the oldest addiction known to humans and begins to live a revolutionary life. The life for which you were created. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;Discover what a ME-free world looks like, starting here. &lt;/p&gt;" />
