  <title>The Other Witness - Ben Behrens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although math can serve as a stumbling block for many, it plays a surprisingly important role in our understanding of the Bible. The scriptures are filled with not only quantitative numbers but also intrinsic meanings integrated into their usage. In fact, the whole universe functions in space with time, mass, and energy all governed by mathematical laws created by our God.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Other Witness&lt;/i&gt; seeks to serve as a starting point for the exploration of biblical math. This study considers numbers and their usage in the Bible in order to illustrate their meanings, and it develops a reference to confirm biblical stories. It also explores related algebraic equations to obtain more details. With this knowledge, you can better understand how numbers are integrated both in scripture and in the world around you.&lt;p&gt;
Offering a unique approach to the study of numbers in scripture and in everyday life, &lt;i&gt;The Other Witness&lt;/i&gt; seeks to inspire you to search and research the Bible for a greater appreciation of the scriptures truth." />
