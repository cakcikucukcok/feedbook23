  <title>Paul, Apostle of Weakness: Astheneia and Its Cognates in the Pauline Literature, Revised Edition - David Alan  Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this practical book every occurrence of astheneia and its cognates in the Pauline Epistles is examined, both in its immediate context and in its relation to Pauline thought as a whole. The analysis begins, first, by examining both secular and Septuagintal Greek usages of astheneia as well as its usage in the non-Pauline New Testament writings. It then proceeds, secondly, by defining Paul&#39;s astheneia termini from letter to letter and context to context. All the passages in the Pauline literature where the words appear undergo a detailed exegetical examination. The Pauline weakness motif is then summarized, with the conclusion that the concept of weakness is foundational to Paul&#39;s anthropology, Christology, and ethics." />
