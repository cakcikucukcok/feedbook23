  <title>Kill Religion!: The Deserved Death of Faith - Ranty McRanterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered why people have faith? Why don&#39;t they choose not to have faith? How does it help you to believe things for which no reasons or evidence can be provided? Is faith pure wish fulfillment? Is it social conditioning, brainwashing, mind control? Imagine a world where no one had ever heard of Moses, the Buddha, Jesus, and Mohammed, but everyone had heard of Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Would our world be better or worse? Imagine that not a single person believed in anything. Imagine that no one placed any faith in anything. Imagine that everyone was rational, logical, and committed to evidence and proof. Imagine that everything was rejected that didn&#39;t involve reason, logic, evidence and proof. How would that lead to a worse world? Wouldn&#39;t humans be much smarter? Wouldn&#39;t they evolve much faster?" />
