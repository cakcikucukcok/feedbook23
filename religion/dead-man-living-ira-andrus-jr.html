  <title>Dead Man Living - Ira Andrus Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Like most children, Ira Andrus had a role model. But unlike other kids his age, Ira&amp;#39;s role model was both a fugitive and a thief. In this gripping and unbelievable autobiography, Dead Man Living shows readers how his life took shape to become more like his role model. In the mundane grind of everyday life, Ira was transformed from a troubled teenager into an accomplished and over-confident cat burglar. Story after story, he defies all odds, and nothing seems to be able to stop him. Yet even with a never-ending stream of cash in his pocket and a new car in every city, Ira was haunted by the hollow monotony of running, of never finding peace. His dastardly life of hardened crime, escaping prison, and charmed getaways left him a prisoner outside of his prison cell. When he finds himself inexplicably released from prison just before receiving a life sentence, is there any hope for him to shed his adrenaline-pumped existence for a life of peace? Could his fortuitous escapes be the signs of a providential God that longs to use his evil for good? Would God grant even him the opportunity to find a new role model in Christ? Follow Ira Andrus in Dead Man Living, the true story of how God saves even the most ardent sinners. Ira Andrus is retired from the Dade County Public Schools. He and his wife, Marilyn, live in southern Florida. They have six children, eleven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren, one of which they have adopted as their daughter. Ira currently spends his time enjoying art and writing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
