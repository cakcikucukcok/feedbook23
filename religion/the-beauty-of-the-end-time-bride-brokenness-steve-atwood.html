  <title>The Beauty of the End-Time Bride: Brokenness - Steve Atwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Today, there is a lot of discussion in Christian circles about brokenness. Most of the discussion views it as a negative to be overcome through Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Beauty of the End-Time Bride: Brokenness takes a very different approach. Psalm 51:17 says there is a brokenness that God desires from you as a sacrifice, namely a broken heart and spirit. This is not damaging, but a voluntarily embraced humility. However, it is humility applied to a radical degree. It encompasses issues in your life that you might not have known required humility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Through reading this book, you will examine in depth little-explored issues that affect how you live a God-pleasing life. When was the last time you questioned how the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil governs your life today? You will then see how this mostly overlooked spiritual truth empowers deeper exploration of well-known themes like dying to the flesh. &lt;/p&gt;
Right now, if this brokenness talk sounds like a downer, dont worry. You can discover how its the key to unlocking the full potential of the Bibles wonderful promises to us.Catch the vision of a much bigger reality to Christian life than we have previously known." />
