  <title>The Great Exchange - Robert Camenisch, Kay Camenisch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ancient ritual of blood covenanting is central to the Bible and fundamental in understanding the nature of our relationship with God, but its meaning and significance has been lost over the centuries. We are related to God covenantally through Jesus Christ. Understanding the significance of the seven exchanges of the ancient covenant ritual gives a picture of God’s love for us and His commitment to those who are His. As you learn the significance of covenant in the lives of Abraham, Moses, Israel, Saul, David, and more, your faith will be strengthened, and your knowledge of God’s love will deepen. Questions are included for group study. Topics include: • Explanation of the seven exchanges of the ancient blood covenant ritual and the significance of each, • Study of the seven exchanges of covenant as revealed in the Bible through accounts of the cutting of the Old Covenant with Abraham and its renewal with the nation of Israel, • Lessons from men in the Bible, illustrating how their level of faithfulness to covenant affected their walk with the Lord and how it impacted their lives, • Explanation of the cutting of the New Covenant with Jesus Christ and what it means for Christians today. “The secret of the Lord is for those who fear Him, And He will make them know His covenant.” Psalm 25:14" />
