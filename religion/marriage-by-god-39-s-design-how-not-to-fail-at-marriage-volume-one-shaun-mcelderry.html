  <title>Marriage By God&#39;s Design; How Not to Fail At Marriage Volume One - Shaun McElderry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In our global society, almost anyone can receive licensure for marriage with the simple words of &quot;I do&quot; without proving they understand what marriage entails. It also seems that almost anyone can redefine the marriage union as it suits them. If one were to search global history of the deliberate evolution of marriage, one would find cases of legally sanction immoral and debased practices under the guise of Holy Matrimony. Fluctuating statistical data depicts those in Christendom faring just as poorly in marriage as those in secular society. The Holy Bible is the only inspired instructional manual for marriage known to mankind. From it, I have outlined three basic marital designs: God&#39;s Design, the Hebraic Design, the Judeo-Christian Design, and the Secular Design. This book covers the differences in the four marriage designs and their impact on global society. Also, this book show God&#39;s plan and order for lovingly harmonious marriage and the power that is released as prescribed in His promises." />
