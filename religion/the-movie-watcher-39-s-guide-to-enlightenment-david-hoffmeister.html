  <title>The Movie Watcher&#39;s Guide to Enlightenment - David Hoffmeister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Accelerate your Awakening – with the movies!
In a radical departure from traditional spiritual cinema David Hoffmeister embraces Hollywood movies as modern day parables for awakening, thus turning the universal pastime of movie watching into a portal for a whole new perspective on Life. Step back, relax and laugh as you learn to see the Big Picture. Allow David and this book to be your gentle guide to a present experience of Enlightenment.
“The temptation of linear time is the belief that things would be better if they were different. The problem with attempting to redo the past is that such attempts obscure the realization that the past is over and gone. Healing is seeing that all the scripts of the world are the same and therefore cannot be changed; this awareness is the forgiven world.”
Excerpt from The Butterfly Effect review, pg. 28
&quot;Since the dawn of time, myths, stories and parables have been used by spiritual teachers to reveal spiritual truths. Many popular movies speak not only to our desire for entertainment, but are also great tools to flush up and look at human emotions for healing. 
In The Movie Watcher&#39;s Guide to Enlightenment, David Hoffmeister uses movies as contemporary parables, making modern spirituality personal and relevant.&quot;
