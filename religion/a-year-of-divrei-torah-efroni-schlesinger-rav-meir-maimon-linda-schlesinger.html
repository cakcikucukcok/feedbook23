  <title>A Year of Divrei Torah - Efroni Schlesinger, Rav Meir Maimon, Linda Schlesinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The idea for this book came from a desire I had to provide anyone who wanted to learn with easily understandable material from the Torah. My solution was to send out an e-mail every week to hundreds of people with interesting information on that weeks  parsha (Torah portion). The difficulty was writing material that was simple enough for those who had no prior knowledge of the Parsha to understand while keeping it substantive enough to interest those who already had a deep knowledge. Since last June, there have been a few hundred people each week receiving words of Torah from me; Id say the project was, for the most part, successful. However, I wasnt yet satisfied. The recipients were limited to those who were on my e-mail list, and I didnt feel that reading a two minute dvar Torah once a week was enough. Firstly, I wanted to greatly expand the range of availability of my weekly divrei Torah. The number of people who could read and benefit from a weekly dvar Torah is limitless so I didnt want the availability of interesting and understandable words of Torah to have a limit. By writing this book, Im attempting to do everything in my power to ensure that anyone on any level has something that they can learn from, be fascinated by, and then teach to others. By closing every dvar Torah with a lesson taken from the Parsha, I hope that this book will not only be educationally enriching but morally enriching as well." />
