  <title>Different Kinds Of Prayers - Evangelist Innocent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Prayer is not based on human mentality or human decision. Rather it is inspired by God for us to pray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of this book is encouraging you to read this book so that you will know the benefit of being prayerful. Remember that when Jesus went up to the mountain, He prayed. When Jesus went out to the wilderness, He prayed. Before Jesus went to the cross, He prayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beloved, there is something that the author has come to know about prayer. After being prayerful, the devil would try to come to attack you one way or another but he will definitely fall because God is faithful beyond temptation. When it comes along our way, God will make a way of escape. When we close our mouth and not be prayerful, God will not answer us. There is time to lift up our voice and pray to God. Prayer is the living proof which will cause God to hear our voice and answer our prayer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are different forms of prayer such as petitionary prayer, the prayer of supplication, the prayer of thanksgiving and worship or praise. Thus, people pray for many reasons such as for personal benefits or for the sake of others. The bible tells us in 1 Thessalonians 5:17&amp;nbsp; that we are to pray without ceasing. Ladies and gentlemen, the author of this book would like to encourage you to pray without ceasing. It does not matter whether we are in hardship or not. Whether we like it or not, we must pray without ceasing. Many people pray as and when they feel like it. But the Lord Jesus Christ spent 40 days to pray in the wilderness. There are many examples of other men of God mentioned in the Bible, who also spent 40 days in prayer. Likewise, we too must imitate them and be like them. The bible says in 1 Corinthians 11:1, &amp;ldquo;Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ.&amp;rdquo; Philippians 4:6 says, &amp;ldquo;Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.&amp;rdquo; When we talk about being prayerful, we cannot pray&amp;nbsp;as we feel like it or as we want to. We should go straight to the point and make our request known to God as what the scripture says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the hope of the author that this book will aid to guide the reader how to come to God in prayer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
