  <title>Angel in Goggles - Randall A. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Angels earthly scriptures regard the earth from personal, secular
perspectives. Like the Christian Bible, its canon admits a surprising
variety of forms and lengths:
There are Stories: a fateful lapse of weather-ethics; the confl ict
between private and public property, the latter including humans
drafted into the military.
Essays: the endless multiplicity of windows (not to be found
in the non-physical, mystical unity of heaven); the problematic
relationship between two species (humans and dogs);
proprioception (the unappreciated, vital sensation of dueling with
gravity); a childrens book as an example earthly art, even to its
media.
A raffi sh Travelogue, intermittent, confi rms the worlds shape as a
sphere. Its counterpoint, also an intermittent series, is a Treasury
about the Wellses retirement Estateon a ridge of the Blue
Ridgearboretum, cloudatorium, weather- observation-post,
lookout vista, and habitat for plants and creatures that include
visiting grandson.
A concluding Fantasy like a two-person play except that one
character can fl y with the help of protective eyewearexplores
the relationship between human and the supposedly divine." />
