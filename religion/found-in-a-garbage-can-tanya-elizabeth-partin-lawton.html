  <title>“Found in a Garbage Can” - Tanya Elizabeth Partin Lawton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The rapid end to the godlessness that we have been living in since the
beginning of time is here at last, at the precipice of the end of times.
The movie, The Day the Earth Stood Still, starring Keanu Reeves, is a
wonderful, though fi ctional, testimony to how the world, or humans,
respond to detrimental situations especially our own. Only when there is
tragedy or even doom do we change and try to save our own lives. There
are serious defi ciencies in genuine love, respect and reverence for the
Almighty God, our Father in Heaven, also in living as new creations of
born again Christians for Jesus Christ. It has tainted the Churches and the
written Word of God to the point that ministers, elders and clergy pretend
not to notice and even believe they are powerless to do anything about it
anymore. They have all let the sin fester for so long that the power of God
cannot live in the churches we build and the presents of the Holy Spirit is
not felt in them either. You will experience with me the memories of my
religious and spiritual experiences coupled with my everyday challenges
to show how this world changed from being lovers of God to being God
haters and what we must do to change and follow Him.
&quot;Found in a Garbage Can&quot; is a testimony of a young girl who through trial after trial grows spiritually and found that God was with her throughout her life.
The book starts speaking of time and the ages. It speaks on miracles and childhood notions that will cause you to remember.
That people will begin reading their bibles and with living the finest principles studies because they are life changing.
I recommend everyone that is able to read Found in a Garbage Can. This book will cause you to be moved by events have been though and the product of my change and obedience." />
