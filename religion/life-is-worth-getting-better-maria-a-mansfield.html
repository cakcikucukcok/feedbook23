      <meta name="description" content="ABOUT THE BOOK

She also adds valuable advice for confronting mental disorders in ones life or the lives of loved ones. She shares reminders from the Scriptures, of the consolation that faith in God can provide, and mentions the verses in the Bible, which helped her faith grow stronger during that season of her life.
Marias desire in writing this book was to be able to encourage others to get the help they need to recover. Her story is about hope and redemption and about finding encouragement to live your life to the fullest.
Your life is a gift, thats why Life is Worth Getting Better." />
