  <title>The Ultimate Love - Jean Swartz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The main objectives of this book is to make the reader understand and realise who you are in Christ, to give a holistic form of the human race and how much we are loved, and to bring the Holy Bible, which is the Word of God, together for the ordinary man and woman in the street who are battling to lay ahold upon the truths of God and those who are struggling to grasp and understand and make human sense from the scriptures in the Bible. Also, how we as humanity are interlink and entwined into our Maker. I hope that you will read this book with an open mind. 
It is my prayer that each reader will be led to have a deeper and more meaningful fellowship with their loved ones and in their love relationship towards God and with their fellow human beings." />
