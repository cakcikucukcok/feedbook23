  <title>Subversive Jesus - Craig Warren Greenfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Jesus left the most exclusive gated community in the universe to come live with the people he loved and gave his life for, he turned everything we know and believe about life on its head. Jesus said that he came to bring good news to the poor, but most Western Christians remain disconnected and isolated from the poor and their contexts of injustice. Even our churches echo society&amp;rsquo;s pressure to isolate ourselves from the margins (e.g. by moving to a better suburb) and instead teach us how to be &amp;ldquo;nice people&amp;rdquo; who worship a &amp;ldquo;nice Jesus&amp;rdquo; and don&amp;rsquo;t disrupt the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convinced that Jesus places love for the poor and the pursuit of justice central, Craig Greenfield has sought to follow in Christ&amp;rsquo;s footsteps by living among people at the edges of society for the last fourteen years. His quest to follow this Subversive Jesus has taken Craig and his young family from the slums of Asia to inner city Canada and back again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the story of how Jesus led them to the margins: initiating the Pirates of Justice flash mobs, sharing their home with detoxing crackheads, welcoming homeless panhandlers and prostitutes to the dinner table, and ultimately sparking a movement to reach the world&amp;rsquo;s most vulnerable children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a strong and potentially controversial critique of the status quo too often found in our churches, but it offers an inspirational and hopeful vision of another way. While readers may not relocate to a slum, they will certainly come to view their lives and ministry through a fresh lens&amp;mdash;reconsidering how they are uniquely called by Jesus to subversively love the poor and break down systems of injustice in their sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
