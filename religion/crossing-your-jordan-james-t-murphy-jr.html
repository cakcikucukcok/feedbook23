  <title>Crossing Your Jordan - James T. Murphy, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the maze of trying to live a life worthy of the sacred calling runs parallel with the various trials and tribulations that often must be defeated if victory is to be experienced. Each Christian faces what I have defined as Jordan Rivers which often flows with the high currency that can sweep one under to drown in the sea of pain and frustration. 
Crossing Your Jordan is an exposition through the biblical text of The Book of Joshua as he leads the people of Israel across the Jordan River into the land of victory (Canaan) encountering an expedition that provides various helpful insights into how Christians can be victorious in crossing the Jordan Rivers of life. These are preached sermons that assisted a congregation across diverse Jordans that hopefully will come alongside those who find themselves in familiar territory." />
