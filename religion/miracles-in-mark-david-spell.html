  <title>Miracles in Mark - David Spell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Gospel of Mark has long been regarded as The Gospel of Action. It contains more miracles and supernatural phenomena than Matthew, Luke, or John. In fact, a third of Mark&#39;s Gospel is centered on the miraculous deeds of Jesus. Mark is clearly more concerned with what Jesus did than with what He said. From the vision that Jesus experienced at His baptism to the supernatural events surrounding the crucifixion and resurrection, Dr. Spell will take the reader on a journey of exploration through the pages of Mark&#39;s Gospel. The miracles of Jesus are as profoundly important for us today as they were for those who experienced them. This study will help to guide readers in finding insights for their own lives." />
