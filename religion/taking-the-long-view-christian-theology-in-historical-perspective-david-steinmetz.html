  <title>Taking the Long View: Christian Theology in Historical Perspective - David Steinmetz</title>

The book illustrates its thesis with tough-minded examples from the Churchs life and thought, ranging from more abstract problems like the theoretical role of historical criticism to such painfully concrete issues as the commandment of Jesus to forgive unforgivable wrongs." />
