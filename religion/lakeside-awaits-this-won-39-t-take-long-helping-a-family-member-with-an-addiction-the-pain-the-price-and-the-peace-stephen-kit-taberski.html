  <title>Lakeside Awaits This Won&#39;t Take Long: Helping a Family Member with an Addiction. the Pain, the Price and the Peace - Stephen Kit Taberski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This fast-paced action packed thriller is sure to leave you breathless. It is a true story like none other and in the true tradition of a Hollywood thriller. Trouble with authorities, violence, questionable friends, murder, and greed not to mention a legal system full of corruption... All of these push the author to fight first for his own life and then afterwards to fight to save his freedom. Writer Steve Taberski has written a true story that any family or friend of an alcoholic can truly relate to. The characters are real. The events that occur are real. Two brothers living in Michigan embark together on an everyday mission to rescue a third brother from a gripping alcohol addiction. Every action to assist him is met with a roller coaster of events. Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote, &quot;To know, even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.&quot; As you read the riveting story you will encounter first hand, some of the many ways addiction affects the lives of others by fueling lies and deception that waste much time, energy, and patience. Is it all worth it when it happens to be your brother? Read this story and then decide for yourself." />
