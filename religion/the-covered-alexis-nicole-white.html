  <title>The Covered - Alexis Nicole White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Upon graduating from Purdue University in 2008, Alexis Nicole White decides to relocate to the Land of Opportunity &amp;ndash; Atlanta, Georgia. Like most women, the way she viewed success was to be loved while being in-love in a healthy, growing and satisfying relationship. As she pursues her dreams, her burning passion for journalism grows cold. While being unemployed, homeless and broke, Alexis walks down a dark, lonely boulevard of broken dreams. After meeting a variety of people who pledged to help her, Alexis is introduced to a world of trouble. Realizing all that glitters is not gold, she finds herself in the middle of drama that is full of deceit and mischief. Betrayed by an&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;emotionally abusive friend, she&amp;rsquo;s left all alone in a strange city. Tormented by her decisions, she has to decide what is best for her sanity. Although she suffers&amp;nbsp;setbacks professionally and personally, she is forced to re-defined what it means to have love, happiness and success. Not sure who to trust, she decides to activate her faith in God, proving that she is Covered, above all. Will she return home as a failure? Or, will she conquer the fight of her life to survive the mean streets of Atlanta?&lt;/p&gt;" />
