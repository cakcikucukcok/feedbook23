  <title>Meeting God Half Way - Dr. Ronald B. Parton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;It is said if you answer one question ten others pop up in its place! Not only in philosophical mapping is it true, the questions multiply even more for all who look in the God domain. Questions may seem similar, but the diversity of human experience ands the cultural milieu tend to make one think things are actually different language systems. Meeting and knowing God varies for societies; diversity varies within societies, religious intuitions, family traditions and an untold more make God communication very difficult. Underneath hem all, they are basically the same.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book on meeting God is not intended to answer questions; it is for the thinking person who has spent a lifetime of examination of oneself and the larger world. We ask with you the reader; and do not tell because we are like you, studying the issues. We offer an open question format. We are not silly enough to think there are absolute answers. We suggest information until something better comes along on the journey.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The task is to search and to research some more, until we feel comfortable with a place where we have sought. This may be at the same place where we have started or arrive at a strange place which we never thought existed before our exploration began.&lt;/P&gt;" />
