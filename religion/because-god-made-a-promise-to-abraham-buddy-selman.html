  <title>Because God Made a Promise to Abraham - Buddy Selman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Because God made a promise to Abraham concerning inheriting the land of Israel, a question arises. To which line of Abrahams descendants was the Promise made? Thats important because they worship different Gods. This poses the problem, who is the true God?
This is the question of the ages concerning all claims of Deity. All things of life and death depend on that answer.
This book addresses questions from the perspective that the God of the Bible through Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob is the true God and the God of true Christianity. It distinguishes between true and counterfeit Christianity.
The war that started with Satans attempt to dethrone God and elevate himself to the Almighty is the defining factor of conflict. Association is made between spiritual determinations and earthly happenings. The next earthly event distinguishing where we are in time is the Russian invasion of Israel.
The only remaining possibility for Satans success is stopping God from keeping His promise to Abraham. The mid-east peace problem is not just about ownership of land, but about who is God?
Also addressed  doctrines and theories taught in error. Dispensations, covenants, and promises are defined. How Revelation is structured and plays out is explained.
ne purpose of the book is to cause the reader to think. Not just about things termed religious but in truth, how all things are related, especially political. Hopefully it gives insight on how to prepare mentally, spiritually, and materially for what Scripture says will happen.
Evidence shows we are the generation that experiences the Biblical end times and the fulfillment of Gods promise to Abraham. America must choose  follow the true God or the Satanic one-world government!
The book challenges the true Church to reestablish scripture as our highest authority and be about our task." />
