  <title>Justice Pending - Robert F. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Revelation is a uniquely relevant book. It was written from a pastors heart for a pastoral purpose. John wrote to prepare the saints for the gathering storm as they await the inevitable coming of the Lord. The Revelation is the story of His Day when the Son of Man will appear in heaven like a flash of lighting for all to see. It is the day that God spoke to His prophets about from the foundation of the world. The Revelation is a book filled with allusions and symbols. God did not leave their meaning to guess work. This commentary will challenge the reader to compare his assumptions about the coming of that day with the prophets who wrote about it prolifically. The basic premise of the Reformers was that the Scripture is the best interpreter of Scripture. This commentary was written to demonstrate that comparing Scripture with Scripture is the best way to understand the Revelation. I have deliberately avoided the jargon of the diverse systems of eschatology to allow the reader to focus on the text and let the Scripture speak for its. I have the profound conviction that the believers to whom John wrote understood what he meant. May the blessing promised to those who read and obey this book be yours." />
