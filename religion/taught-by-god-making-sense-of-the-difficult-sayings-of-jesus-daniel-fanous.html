  <title>Taught By God: Making Sense of the Difficult Sayings of Jesus - Daniel Fanous</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Few would dispute that the sayings of Jesus were and are important. But though important, these very same sayings are difficult at best and incomprehensible at worst. Sayings like, &amp;quot;The kingdom of heaven suffers violence,&amp;quot; or, &amp;quot;I did not come to bring peace but a sword,&amp;quot; have confused readers of the Gospels for thousands of years. Others such as, &amp;quot;My Father is greater than I,&amp;quot; and, &amp;quot;My God why have You forsaken Me?&amp;quot; have sparked theological infernos that have plagued Christianity from its beginnings. From the greatest theologians to the smallest child, the same question is always asked: What did Jesus really mean? In considering only the most difficult of the sayings of Jesus, Taught by God brings together the academic rigour of modern biblical scholarship and the profound wisdom of the early Church Fathers in a unique, lively, and dramatic synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the Back Cover&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Taught by God is well researched and speaks clearly and informatively to many of the most difficult aspects of the biblical witness ... students, clergy and lay people could all greatly benefit from a close reading of the book&amp;#39;s arguments and the evidence provided to support them. Daniel Fanous draws a great many good and plausible conclusions regarding difficult passages, and has provided a highly useful tool for people who read Scripture in depth and find themselves troubled or perplexed by these passages.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Very Rev. John Breck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Professor of Biblical Interpretation &amp;amp; Bioethics,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute, France.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;quot;Fascinating and informative ... This book illuminates the background of Jesus&amp;#39; controversies with the Jewish religious leaders and makes Jesus&amp;#39; difficult sayings come alive for the modern reader. The author has done his homework and provides exciting insights into Jesus&amp;#39; ministry.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;--Very Rev.
