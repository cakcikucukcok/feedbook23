  <title>Unity in the Body - Benjamin Karner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Today, more than ever, the church needs to recognize the need for unity. The fabric of society seems to be coming apart at the seams. Societal norms are being challenged and old rifts are being exploited. Political factions cannot seem to agree on anything. Racial strife has heated up to a boiling point. Authority figures are being targeted by people who desire anarchy. Families are being torn apart by lust. Major church denominations are in decline and are experiencing internal fighting over issues. Many local churches are consumed by petty arguments and personal preferences. The human race seems more divided than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason, the church must make a pointed effort to maintain unity. Followers of Jesus Christ need to show the world the strength of being unified in mission and purpose. Jesus desires for his people to demonstrate the supernatural unity that comes from a relationship with him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
