  <title>The Father, a Son, a Daughter, a Love Affair - Charles R. Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THE FATHER, A son, A daughter, A Love Affair shares a story based upon author Charles Watsons personal testimony about Gods plan for marriage for each person. There are things in life that cant be rushed, and following Gods preordained plan for finding a life partner falls into that category. Each chapter of this guide carefully explores each step in the process that 
God follows to enable us to find a true partner of the heart the one true marriage partner for each person. Watson also includes the pertinent scripture that supports Gods plan for love and marriage. 
Song of Solomon states that many waters cannot quench love, nor can the floods drown it: no substantial amount of water can put out the fire of love that is in the heart. When God determines that two people should come together in marriage, it is a wonderful, heartfelt event in the lives of two loving people. Watson cautions that it is not wise to rush or speed up the process, as it can lead to missteps and mistakes made in relationships that can be devastating. If the focus is on finding the best partner with Gods loving guidance, a successful marriage will be the reward." />
