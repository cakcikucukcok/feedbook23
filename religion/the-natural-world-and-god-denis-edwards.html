  <title>The Natural World and God - Denis Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How are we to think about the natural world around us in relation to the God of Jesus? Astronomers, cosmologists, and evolutionary biologists have opened wonderfully new ways of seeing the community of life on Earth, and its place in the universe. At the same time we are facing an extreme crisis of life on our planet. Both of these realities demand that we rethink our theology of animals, plants, ecosystems, as well as galaxies and stars. In this book, Denis Edwards collects together a series of explorations into this kind of theology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denis Edwards&lt;/strong&gt; is a professorial fellow in theology at Australian Catholic University, Adelaide campus, and a member of ACU&amp;rsquo;s Institute for Relition and Critical Inquiry. He is a priest of the Catholic Archdiocese of Adelaide, involved in Tranmere parish. As a Fellow of the International Society for Science and Religion, much of his recent research has been in the dialogue between science and theology, and the emerging field of ecological theology, resulting in publications that include &lt;em&gt;Partaking of God: Trinity, Evolution and Ecology&lt;/em&gt; (Collegeville, Minnesota: Liturgical Press, 2014), &lt;em&gt;Jesus and the Natural World: Exploring a Christian Approach to Ecology&lt;/em&gt; (Mulgrave, Vic: Garratt, 2012), and &lt;em&gt;How God Acts: Creation, Redemption and Special Divine Action &lt;/em&gt;(Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2010).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
