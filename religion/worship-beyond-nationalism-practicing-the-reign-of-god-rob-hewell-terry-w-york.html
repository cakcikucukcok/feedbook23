  <title>Worship Beyond Nationalism: Practicing the Reign of God - Rob Hewell, Terry W. York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The church in the United States faces a dilemma: How is it possible for Christ&#39;s followers to worship faithfully in a nationalistic environment where religion and politics enjoy a vigorous affiliation while the separation of church and state is celebrated as the standard for the relationship between nation and faith? When nationalism propagates itself through a cross-pollination of the stories, symbols, and celebrations of the nation-state and religious groups, the stage is set for a national history bearing the character of sanctified legend. Such resulting civil religious activity is likely to create dissonance for Christ&#39;s followers between what they understand to be biblically faithful and what nationalistic practices may endorse as religiously valid.  Worship Beyond Nationalism explores faithful worship as a political act by which Christians declare their allegiance to God in Christ rather than to worldly empires, enabling congregations to enact the reality of God&#39;s kingdom and embody the gospel for the glory of God and for the sake of the world." />
