  <title>Training Young Hearts for Christ: Opening Up the Reformed Catechisms for the Entire Family - Adam Murrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many people react negatively to the word catechism, viewing it with suspicion in the belief that it involves rote repetition of obscure points of doctrine. But nothing could be further from the truth. While there is little doubt that memorization has been an overlooked method of teaching, there are good reasons why Christians should retain this ancient practice of instruction. &lt;i&gt;Training Young Hearts for Christ&lt;/i&gt; is anything but a dry discussion of minute points of doctrine. Instead, Adam Murrell offers fresh, helpful insights into some of Christianity&#39;s most cherished catechisms by presenting gospel truths to a young and modern generation in plain language that makes this complex subject easily understood. In so doing, he reminds all of us of what God has done for his people in this world and in the one to come." />
