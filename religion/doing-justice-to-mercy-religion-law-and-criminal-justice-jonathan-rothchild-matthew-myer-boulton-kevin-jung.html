  <title>Doing Justice to Mercy: Religion, Law, and Criminal Justice - Jonathan Rothchild, Matthew Myer Boulton, Kevin Jung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is often assumed that the law and religion address different spheres of human     life. Religion and ethics articulate complex systems of moral reasoning that concern norms,     deliberation of ends, cultivation of disposition, and transformation of moral agency. Law, in     contrast, seeks to govern human conduct through procedural justice, rights, and public good.     Doing Justice to Mercy challenges this assumption by presenting the reader with an urgent     conversation between the law and religion that yields a constructive approach, both     theoretically and practically, to the complex role of mercy in our legal     process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Authored by legal practitioners, activists, and theorists in     addition to theologians and ethicists, the essays collected here are informed by timeless     principles, and yet they could not be timelier. The trend in sentencing moves toward an     increased severity, and the number of incarcerated people in the United States is at an all-time     high. In the half-decade since 9/11, moreover, homeland security has established itself as a     permanent fixture in our lives. In this atmosphere, the current volume seeks initially to     clarify how justice and mercy intertwine in relation to a number of issues, such as     rehabilitation, the death penalty, domestic violence, and war crimes. Exploring the legal,     philosophical, and theological grounds for mercy in our courts, the discussion then moves to the     practical ways in which mercy may be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributors:Marc Mauer, The     Sentencing Project * Lois Gehr Livezey, McCormick Theological Seminary * Ernie Lewis,     Public Advocate, Commonwealth of Kentucky * Jonathan Rothchild, Loyola Marymount University     * Albert W.
