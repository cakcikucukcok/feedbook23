  <title>The Scientist&#39;s Conversations with the Teacher - Alexander Zelitchenko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world is &quot;bigger&quot; than it seems. Besides the world of things, which is
the coarsest,
there are more subtle worlds. Just like the world of things, the subtle
worlds are material:
each one is formed by material of a particular subtlety.
Each part of the World  is a triad &quot;Idea (incarnated by a thing)-Thing-Being
(that realizes
the idea and makes the thing).&quot; Triads form the World Hierarchy of
ideas-things-beings.
Any triad develops. What is subtle develops into what is coarse, while what
is coarse
develops into what is subtle.
Each  being works together with other beings. Being has instruments -
bodies - for
working with materials of varying subtlety.
Man has three bodies: a spiritual one, a mental one and a physical one.
Man&#39;s task is to
realize special &quot;human&quot; ideas. This process culminates when ones comes to
spiritual
awareness. The development of man is a development of spiritual awareness.
Man needs to purify himself, from time to time, from the by-products of the
realization of
ideas. This purification is death. Death turns man into another being, but
it does not stop
development.
Man&#39;s fate provides him with the best conditions for working and developing." />
