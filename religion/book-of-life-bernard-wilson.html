  <title>Book of Life - Bernard Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This guide focuses on our salvation and solving the problems in todays world. Guided by the spirit of truth in his research and writing, author Bernard Wilson relies on the Scriptures as the basis for the information that he offers in Book of Life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Singling out two primary verses as sources for understanding how to unlock the mystery of the Bible, Wilson explains that we need to accept all scriptures as being true and cautions that it is not possible to read Scriptures consecutively. Instead, they should be pieced together by the spirit of truth. We need to realize were not the first era of humans to exist on this planet, and were not likely to be the last. Most generations before us chose a democracy for their way of governing believing it would be fair and all citizens would have an equal chance. They failed, however, to consider greed that led to love of money and lust for power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
Book of Life shows the true way to be saved and how to prevent man from destroying himselfa moneyless culture that has been proven effective for millions of years is the only answer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
