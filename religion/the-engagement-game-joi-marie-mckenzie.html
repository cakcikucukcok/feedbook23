  <title>The Engagement Game - Joi-Marie McKenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Joi-Marie almost has it all; a thriving career, a supportive family, great friends, and an apartment in Manhattan. What she doesn&#39;t have is a husband.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Ambitious, confident, and successful, Joi-Marie believes she has it all figured out. At 28 years old, she has an enviable job as a producer, covering entertainment in New York City. Her close-knit family is loving and encouraging, and her boyfriend, Adam, is as close to perfect as you can get -- except for the fact that he won&#39;t propose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Like most women, Joi-Marie has a checklist of what the perfect life looks like. She has the career, the friends, the apartment, and the lifestyle she has always wanted. But, when the husband she wants doesn&#39;t fall into place, she decides to play the game-the engagement game-in order to get Adam to drop down on one knee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  After receiving a laundry list of advice on how to secure a proposal--even researching how to cook &quot;engagement chicken&quot;-- Joi-Marie realizes that, in the process of trying to attain her perfect life, she has slowly become a person she doesn&#39;t recognize. With this discovery, she must make a decision: pretend to be someone she&#39;s not in order to have the life she envisioned...or have the courage to be herself and find her happily ever after in a way she never expected." />
