  <title>Listening to Your Igod - tyler (t.J.) James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Listening to Your iGod&lt;/i&gt; revives the discussion of religion and science and the parallels that exist between the two fields of thought.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Author Tyler James presents his thoughts on why these two very different schools of thought may actually complement each other at times. Jesus taught in parables that offered parallels between nature and Gods word. Jesus himself was paralleled with nature as well, lending credence to the idea that there is more to spreading Gods word than the obvious.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Consideration of the segregation and feud between science and religion points to similar segregation and differences among the worlds societies and religions today. James suggests that the world as a whole needs to gain greater maturity in order to get past these differences and live in harmony. Moreover, this connection is even more relevant given the impending apocalypse, which he believes will begin in 2016.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;By showing the parallels between science and religion in &lt;i&gt;Listening to Your iGod&lt;/i&gt;, James hopes to lay the groundwork for connection and harmony.&lt;/p&gt;" />
