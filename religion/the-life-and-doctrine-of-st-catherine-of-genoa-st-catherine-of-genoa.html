  <title>The Life and Doctrine of St. Catherine of Genoa - St. Catherine of Genoa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Life and Doctrine of St. Catherine of Genoa brings the three major works of this remarkable Saint - &quot;The Life of St. Catherine of Genoa,&quot; &quot;Dialogues of the Soul and Body,&quot; and &quot;Treatise on Purgatory&quot; - together in one fully approachable volume. Her autobiographical &quot;The Life&quot; reveals the Saint&#39;s difficult journey from her thwarted youthful ambition to embrace the religious life, to a violently troubled arranged marriage, to the experience, at age 26, of a deep mystical conversion which granted her a continual, lifelong inner state of intimate personal communion with God. &quot;Dialogues of the Soul and Body&quot; is among the clearest explorations ever written of the inner work required to attain Sainthood. &quot;Treatise on Purgatory&quot; literally &quot;wrote the book&quot; on the afterlife, and remains to this day the preeminent text on the unfinished soul&#39;s fiery pathway to final union with God.  St. Catherine of Genoa was beatified in 1675 by Pope Clement X, and canonized in 1737 by Pope Clement XII." />
