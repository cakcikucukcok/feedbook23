  <title>The Blank Cheque - 窶郎inka Ayobolu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Blank Cheque&lt;/i&gt; offers inspiration, exploration and insightful thoughts drawn from author Yinka Ayobolus real-life experiences, along with a few divine encounters with Jesus. Ayobolu includes a variety of scriptural references that address many challenging questions of life for which humanity has been trying to find answers to since the beginning of time. 
Who am I? Where did I come from? Did God really create us, or are we a product of a carefully organized explosion called the big bangor the product of evolution? How do we find the convergence between God and the knowledge of science? 
Discover how you can acquire a better understanding of yourself and the world you live in and how you can make success of your life while you are still conscious of your existence.
In these strange times, we need to decide how to come out of these challenges. In His infinite wisdom, God has given us a blank cheque and a golden pen that we can use to access His infinite treasury; we have the ability to fill it in as we wish because we are running out of intelligence and resources. We dont know what to do next on earth.
Where do we start?" />
