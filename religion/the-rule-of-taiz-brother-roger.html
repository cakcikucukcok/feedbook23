  <title>The Rule of Taiz???? - Brother Roger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;For more than fifty years, the international ecumenical community at Taiz&amp;amp;#233; has had an enduring and unparalleled attraction for young adults, whether Christian or not. Its roots go back to wartime France, when a young man, who was to become Brother Roger, settled in the impoverished and largely abandoned village of Taiz&amp;amp;#233;. He dreamed of beginning a community life of work and prayer among the poor, and quickly found himself looking after Jewish refugees. Later, he and his companions tended German prisoners of war and orphaned children. The Community became more visible in 1949, when the first seven Taiz&amp;amp;#233; brothers made a lifelong commitment to monastic life. The Rule of Taiz&amp;amp;#233;, was written by Brother Roger a few years later and has been a reference point for the Community ever since. After Brother Roger&amp;amp;#8217;s untimely death on 16th August 2005 &amp;amp;#150; when he was attacked and killed while praying with more than 2,000 young people &amp;amp;#150; the Community republished The Rule in French and later prepared a fresh translation into English. Though written with the Community in mind, this work of deep insight and broad vision is a mine of wisdom for all those seeking to live in harmony with others and with God.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
