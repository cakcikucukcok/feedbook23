  <title>Capitalism, Democracy &amp; Emerging Christianity - Stephen V. Riley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CAPITALISM, DEMOCRACY &amp; EMERGING CHRISTIANITY As the world seems to be self-destructing with war, social upheaval, terrorism, rapid ecological damage, global warming, financial meltdowns, dire poverty, and increasing disparities of wealth, humankind is being forced to mend its ways or become an extinct species. There is also emerging in the world a higher consciousness that can be said to be the evolutionary destiny of humankind in providing for its own survival. It is about seeking a more just, sustainable, and compassionate world. It is &quot;the great turning&quot; that social scholars are speaking about, like David Korten, Paul Hawken, Eckhart Tolle, Wendell Berry, and Leonardo Boff. Many Christians also view this emerging higher consciousness as the incarnate spirit of the risen Christ now dwelling within all of humankind. To the author, this evolutionary shift in human consciousness is challenging and delegitimizing the forces of global corporate capitalism throughout the world. This higher consciousness is beginning to challenge these forces with the spiritual dynamics of democracy. The author warns us though that the continuous waging of war by the U.S. will probably never end without persistent and massive creative nonviolent civil disobedience. The author also speaks of the emerging Christianity movement as being part of this shift in global consciousness. Also within this challenge is the dysfunction of the human ego. Institutional consumer capitalism feeds on the human ego. This is what makes for a dysfunctional society. The power of the human ego can only be dealt with through a contemplative mind. Thus, emerging Christianity, with its more prophetic and contemplative faith, can serve as an important praxis to this shift in global consciousness. The author summarizes his essay with the thoughts that universal justice and democracy should be a major focus of the emerging Christianity movement. This is to engage all of humankind. The freedom to think great thoughts is what will give credibility to the emerging Christianity movement." />
