  <title>Journey to Infinity - Aadeshnath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yogi Hemant Panchpor alias Aadeshnath was born and brought up in a middle class family from Pune, India.  He has traveled to different parts of the world in the search of mystery of spiritual world.  Settled in Toronto, his thoughts are revolutionary in nature.  His attachment to the culture in the East and personal development from the West makes him a right person to write on the topic.  He has received spiritual blessing in the young age in India.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
His working life in the North America gives him insight in the life of common people.  His experience as Yoga teacher and practitioner gives him authority to speak on the topic of Mental Yoga based on Bhagwad Geeta, a topic not yet touched upon in  North America.   Mental Yoga by Andy Bernstein or Dr. Mark Hyman is different.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He tries to unlock the information locked in Sanskrit, an ancient Indian language, and brings the principles of Yoga  for the benefit of the Western society.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He has studied Bible, Quran as well as Bhagwad Geeta, and he is painting a picture of the future based on these holy books.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book has been edited and propelled by his friends relating to different faiths and coming from different parts of the world and settled in Toronto.  The help from Hindu Prarthana Samaj, ISKCON, Islamic Information Center and International Church of Toronto is very much appreciated in addition to Sri Ambika Yog Kutir, Thane, India.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You will find this book full of spiritual knowledge and it presents ways to face the stress in the Western life.
