  <title>Children of Abraham: - Michael S. Pendergast Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It all began with Abraham, and with his son Isaac and his older brother Ishmael.
The question in dispute today is where it all ends  or should end.  Does history lead us to a particular descendent of Ishmael, Mohammed of Mecca and the religion he founded?  Or does it lead instead to a descendent of Isaac, Jesus of Nazareth and a competing religion  Christianity?  Is there any hope of discovering which of the alternatives is the true path that we should embrace and follow?
There is!  For the Holy Book of one religion sets out a test  consistency  and then fails to pass it in a spectacular fashion.  The Scriptures of the other religion, however, sets out a different test  meeting prophecy  and then stuns us by flawlessly passing not only it, but other books test as well.
Step inside this short manuscript and we will journey through history, examining the lives of Abraham, Mohammed, and Jesus, and the religion each was intimately associated with.  As we do so, we will make some amazing discoveries that may perhaps change forever your ideas about who Jesus and Mohammed were and what Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are all about." />
