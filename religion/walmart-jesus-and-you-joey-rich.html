  <title>Walmart, Jesus, and You - Joey Rich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discovering the Gospel in Everyday Living&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart, Jesus and You is a challenging invitation to hear Jesus speak to you personally about the importance and significance of everyday events in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, many have failed to grasp the reality that Jesus has not changed His method of teaching. In the past, His use of parables helped people understand and apply Gods truth to their own life. Today, through Scripture and your own life experiences, Jesus can do the same. Have you read the Parable of the Buzzard, the Parable of Elvis, or the Parable of Walmart? You can find them and many more as the subject matter of this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Scripture is laid alongside a trip to Walmart, frustration with computers, ordering a hamburger, and other everyday experiences, you will know subject matter for parables is all around us. Then as you read the true life experiences of the author and what Jesus says about these experiences, you will recognize and learn how Jesus can speak to you using every day events in your life. You will develop a greater understanding of Gods word and grow closer to the master teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walmart, Jesus, and You is easy to understand but will powerfully touch your spirit. With each chapter teaching a different life principle, the book is excellent for small groups and is useful to pastors, teachers, and others in the local church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds from the sale of this book will go to assist Southern Baptist international missions efforts through the Lottie Moon Christmas Offering.&lt;/p&gt;" />
