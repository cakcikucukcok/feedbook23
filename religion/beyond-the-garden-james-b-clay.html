  <title>Beyond the Garden - James B. Clay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Shakespeare said, All the worlds a stage; all the men and women merely players.

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;My book, Beyond the Garden, takes a look at conventional, fundamental &lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt&quot;&gt;religious thought which is prevalent today, and especially in thoughts such as the gay issue. I suggest that there is another view of life which includes all men and women as brothers and sisters and their sexual preferences&lt;/SPAN&gt;. Just as Martin Luther King and the eightys ladies sought to bring freedom to the oppressed, so should the knights of today seek to bring freedom to all mankind. The new frontier &lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt&quot;&gt;becomes an inescapable acceptance of all humanity because that is the issue of &lt;/SPAN&gt;unreality prevalent today.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Each of us needs to learn that the one thing needful in &lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt&quot;&gt;this world of woe is understanding, acceptance and lasting relationships. This book offers a suggestion for those who want to find true freedom and oneness with his &lt;/SPAN&gt;brothers and sisters and God.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt&quot;&gt;While some of the more conventional religious books have mainstream &lt;/SPAN&gt;thought, Beyond the Garden differs in that it acknowledges other thought patterns to show the offal of our existence until we understand who we are. By coming to this understanding, we discover true freedom. The story of the biblical &lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt&quot;&gt;Cain represents the story of Israel; more than that, it is the story of everyone in his &lt;/SPAN&gt;God given freedom outside the garden without compassion. The mark of Cain becomes the standard by which one lives in his freedom. For me, the mark &lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt&quot;&gt;represents an attempt to find true freedom which falls short of our goal as humans, &lt;/SPAN&gt;or as Erich Fromm would say, Escape from Freedom. To get beyond the garden &lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: -0.1pt&quot;&gt;is mans lot in life.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;A more profound inspiration seems to compel us back to the &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;LETTER-SPACING: 0.05pt&quot;&gt;garden where we will find our hearts desire. Herein the quest begins. In other &lt;/SPAN&gt;words, we search for the truth &lt;U&gt;beyond&lt;/U&gt; what is not!&lt;/P&gt;" />
