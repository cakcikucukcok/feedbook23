  <title>Decoding the Beast - Graeme Torckler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Still one of the most important cities, the Mega City of Babylon, has yet to make her dbut. This city is a global capital, destined to control the entire earth and I can tell you, she is everything to do with the 666 systems. But she still needs to be built, or it is possible right now, she is being rebuilt, getting ready for her ratification as an independent sovereignty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decoding the Beast, enters you in the the beginning of a journey, the development of the six six six system. Which is growing into governing application through a massive collective of technologies. These will eventually mature to a global authority, as a system controlled by non-sovereign organisations. Could it be possible that the day will come, when one click on an Accept option, could damn your soul forever? Before this day comes, the world has a journey to go through. The political strategies to implement such an all-encompassing network is complicatated and tedious. For right now, the physical computing systems and their applications are still in early day development. Think about it, the world of internet usage is only some twenty years old and already nations are falling, boundaries are changing, opinions and morals reshaping, new enemies growing, new global tactics developing, as everything on planet earth is being rearranged by the e-world. These time periods are speeding up, things are happening very fast, but the journey has still a distance to go. This book brings you a spiritual and scriptural look into the journey of the beast and who its players are.&lt;/p&gt;" />
