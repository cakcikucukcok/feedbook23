  <title>In Every Pew Sits a Broken Heart - Ruth Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Graham - daughter of beloved evangelist Billy Graham - offers a guide for those who are hurting or those who love them. She illustrates through personal stories and Scripture how nothing can keep you from experiencing the fullness of God&#39;s grace. Run with Ruth to the arms of the God you can trust, the Father God who embraces, sustains, and redeems your brokenness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruth Graham has discovered through bitter personal experience that God does his great work in the ruins of our lives. As Ruth&#39;s life descended through divorce, depression, and shame; as she bore heartrending parental struggles; and as she faltered trying to make wise choices in the wake of bad ones, she discovered the unending embrace of a faithful, forgiving, and grace-filled God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book surpasses the testimony of her fascinating story as she brings sharp new insight from the Word of God for all who fear their actions may be beyond forgiveness or their broken circumstances may keep them from being used by God ever again. Through the words of Jeremiah - the weeping prophet - Ruth reveals the God who makes wasted places come to life. You&#39;ll explore the parable of the Prodigal Son as never before as Ruth discloses her own likeness to each character:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The indignant older brother, struggling to understand God&amp;rsquo;s grace toward her husband&#39;s infidelity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The prodigal, wading through the deep shame and painful circumstances of her own actions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The father, running to embrace her children in the midst of bulimia, drug abuse, and unplanned pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruth includes practical steps in every chapter anyone can take to offer care, support, and hope to the broken people they encounter in their lives and in the pews beside them every Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;" />
