  <title>On Rowan Williams: Critical Essays - Matheson  Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theologian, poet, public intellectual, and clergyman, Rowan Williams is one of the leading lights of contemporary British theology. He has published over twenty books and one hundred scholarly essays in a distinguished career as an academic theologian that culminated in his appointment as Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at Oxford University. Williams left this post to serve in the Anglican Church, first as Bishop of Monmouth, then Archbishop of Wales, before finally being enthroned in 2003 as the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury.  In this collection of essays, a talented younger generation of Australian theologians critically analyzes the themes that bind together Williams&#39;s theology. These sympathetic yet probing essays traverse the full breadth of Williams&#39;s work, from his studies on Arius, the Desert Fathers, Hegel, and Trinitarian theology to his more pastoral writings on spirituality, sexuality, politics, and the Anglican Church." />
