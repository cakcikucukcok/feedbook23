  <title>Lord, Why Am I Still in the Waiting Room? - Ta-Tanisha Thames</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lord, Why Am I Still in the Waiting Room?Understanding the Importance of How and Why to Wait Well presents a valuable approach to life that cuts against the grain of most modern lives. Ta-Tanisha Thames, a certified breakthrough life coach, suggests that waiting both patiently and purposefully, despite desires for quick fixes and instant resolutions, is crucial for living meaningfully. In fact, Lord, Why Am I Still in the Waiting Room? suggests that times of waiting are part of Gods way of leading individuals to understand their circumstances, to hear their callings, and to embrace the potential that Jesus Christ has in store for them.
Using the image of the waiting room, Lord, Why Am I Still in the Waiting Room? approaches the times of waiting one faces in life in seven chapters that address various topics: How did I get to the waiting room?; How long is the wait time?; What should I do in the waiting room?; Misconceptions about the waiting room; Who else is in the waiting room?; Beware of distractions in the waiting room; and, finally, The reward on waiting well.
Sometimes life may present you with pauses, moments between, or gaps in progress. The lure is not to see these times as impediments to your movement, your advancement. The gift that Lord, Why Am I Still in the Waiting Room? offers is to invite you to embrace waiting as a blessing from God, given as a way to learn how to wait well." />
