  <title>Truth That Will Set You Free - John David Haffenden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout this book youll read about very important prophesied biblical events that have already occurred, leading right up to the beginning of the Church Age. Also explore what occurs during and after the Church Age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our entire reference has been Gods Holy Word (KJV); the goal of this book is not to give you thoughts or comments of the author or others, because these would be no less erroneous and misleading than many already given and recorded. Only Gods Holy Spirit knows the mind and intent of almighty God, the Father. He promised that He would teach us and make Gods mind and intent known to us. My prayer for this book is based on Proverbs 22:21: That I might make thee to know the certainty of the words of truth, that thou mightest be able to answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I most sincerely hope and pray that in regard to each subject in this book, you will do as the Bereans did. Verify every word in this book with Gods word. It is Gods will that each person should be personally convinced and persuaded.&lt;/p&gt;" />
