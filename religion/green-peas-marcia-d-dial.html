  <title>Green Peas - Marcia D. Dial</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The things of life challenge us in many areas.  Our positive attitude, level of faith and ardent determination are some keys which allow us the success we seek.  Green Peas is the theme of this activity because its story is filled with purpose and reason leading to divine places in destiny.   
Yes, Green Peas is the story of that vegetable that you either like or not.  In my case, not!  The onset coupled along with the lesson learned has destined this activity to a place that has allowed me an invite and a seat at the table of God.  
Intriguing?  Not yet, theres more.  The intent, the purpose, the hope of Green Peas is to lead you down a path of your personal invitation to sit at The Lords table as well.  It encompasses our level of understanding, gratitude and obedience.  All this from a little green pea, you ask?  Yes, is the answer.  
What will challenge you is to find, accept and incorporate the green peas in your individual lives and experiences.  
You are invited to partake of these green peas.  We are in hope that you will not only join us, but embrace the experience we yearn to share.  We hope that your spirit will be touched and affected to the
point of leading you to the pathway of The Table.  I promise, it will be worth it!" />
