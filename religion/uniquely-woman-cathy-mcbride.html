  <title>Uniquely Woman - Cathy McBride</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who can find a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies. This verse from Proverbs begins a powerful passage of Scripture that was written as a guide to finding a wife. The words were written centuries ago when the world was very different, and at first glance, they may not appear to have any relevance for todays busy wife and mother. Or do they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Uniquely Woman&lt;/i&gt; tells of the journey of Leah, a young woman engaged to Benjamin, as she learns what it means to be a godly wife and mother through every season of her life. Cathy McBride follows each step of Leahs story with a detailed analysis of each verse, including meanings of key words that will deepen your understanding and help you examine your own role as a woman of God. Youll learn about your husbands four areas of need and how God intends for a wife to meet those needs. Youll learn even more from the books lessons and questions, whether by yourself or in a study group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todays media is full of confusing images and advice for women, much of which goes against Gods design. In Proverbs, by contrast, Gods picture of women is one of freedom, strength, beauty, and contentment. Well suited for group study, &lt;i&gt;Uniquely Woman&lt;/i&gt; can help women of any age follow his plan for a God-centered marriage and home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
