  <title>Nightingale Nursing? Who Knew? - Jean (Ritchie) Keenan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All over the world, there are confusions that nurses who trained in the way Florence Nightingale advised are not confused about. Nightingale vocational training needs to be reinstated. My hypothesis about the worlds problems is that we are suffering from spiritual anaemia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That can be cured by reinstating the missing part of the pecking order for health and welfare that was devised by Miss Nightingale. The need for nurses to return to be frontline scientists by observing. To return to the common sense of all the basic needs for health Miss Nightingale spent her life studying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain that nurses need to understand world politics and trade, to understand what their patients are stressed about to the extent that they have become ill. To understand that before doctors, they are equal. They have a different duty and discipline, but they are equal as professionals. They, together with the cleaners and ancillary staff, are with the patients 24/7; therefore, the patients need them to be their first and best advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is about my joy and consuming passion, Nightingale nursing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
