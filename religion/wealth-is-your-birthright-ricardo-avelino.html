  <title>Wealth Is Your Birthright - Ricardo Avelino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For your Heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added to you (Matthew 6:32b33). 
Are you looking for an avenue where you can put your money safe with growth, tax advantage, and protection? Do you dream of a cash retirement for yourself that is tax-free? Would you like to leave a tax-free inheritance to your family when you are no longer around? If the answer is a big yes, then this book is for you! 
Likewise, this book shows how giving, saving, and investing before spending is a blessed strategy toward wealth accumulation whether it is through man at work or money at work. 
When God created man in his image, he gave us tangible assets with a command and a blessing: Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Have dominion over . . .  (Genesis 1:2728). When we work, we are exercising our birthright, our dominion. For if we dont work, neither should we eat (2 Thessalonians 3:10)." />
