  <title>The Providence and Grace of God - Karen Jo Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Providence and Grace of God is author Karen Jo Smith&#39;s love letter to the Lord. It presents a story of faith that began in a shelter for battered women, where she discovered the miraculous grace of God. When she found herself in the shelter, she asked God to reveal himself to her through his love and he did! Words are insufficient to describe the reality of the miracles that she has been so privileged to experience at the very hands of God. In this collection of true stories, she recounts the many acts of kindness that she has experienced through God&#39;s grace.
Her touching tales of God&#39;s  miraculous love in the face of so many challenges have truly uplifted her spirit and have provided her with a life purpose. She has made a humble attempt to glorify God by writing about her challenges and struggles. She has also come to know that through prayer and a strong faith in Jesus, all things are possible. It is the desire of her heart that you know that no matter how far you think you have fallen, and no matter how unworthy you may feel, God truly loves you.
Her stories encourage you to take a leap of faith and simply trust in The Providence and Grace of God." />
