  <title>Matthew: The Stories of Jesus&#39; Ministry: Matthew Chapters 14 to 22 - Dennis Herman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the second is a series of stories about the people Jesus ministered to based on the Gospel of Matthew.  Each story looks into the life of the characters in Matthew&#39;s account of Jesus&#39; life.  Each story looks deep into the life of each person Jesus met, considering the trials and events that led them to Jesus.  The stories look past the symbols used in the parable to the events that led up to each, exploring not only the lesson, but the emotion Jesus tried to convey while leading all His followers to a closer relationship with God.  Why did His disciples have trouble understanding some of these parables?  Why didn&#39;t they ask more questions?  What did His disciples learn from each of these experiences?" />
