  <title>Connecting the Fragments - Carolyn Bramhall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a remarkable book written by a remarkable person.  Within these pages Carolyn shares something of her own experiences and uses them to give us insight into the effects of trauma and abuse.  Perhaps what is most notable is that it is all done within the glorious hope of the transformation that Jesus can bring to the darkest of places.  Thank you for this book which brings hope and confidence that Jesus, through his Church, can bring healing and restoration to those who have suffered so much.
Rev. John Ryeland, Director of Christian Healing Mission, London.
Carolyn Bramhall is living proof that even the deepest issues can be fully resolved in Christ. As a sufferer from DID for many years she knows what she is talking about. Even better, she has now spent a decade or more living free of it and helping others to take hold of that freedom for themselves. If you want a good understanding of what DID is and how it can be resolved in Christ, it&#39;s difficult to imagine a better book to read.
