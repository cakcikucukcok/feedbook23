  <title>That I May Know Him - Keith Pointon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How authentic is your Christian life? Is it merely a copy of what youve assimilated from outside sourcesa karaoke version? Or does it flow from a deep, hidden spring within you that has its source in God himself? How broad is your secret history with God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book seeks to draw us into a place with God through the intimate knowledge of Jesus, who produces a flow of life from the very source of life himself. Why be content with secondary sources when you can have pure water from the primary source?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Keith Pointon describes how God redirected his life during a crisis, after he had been a Christian already for twenty-eight years. It led him into an exciting adventure of discovering Jesus in a new way, an adventure that continues unabated after more than a quarter of a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He invites you to share in his insights gained from this adventure, providing a sure foundation for a fruitful life, pleasing both to Jesus and the Father.&lt;/p&gt;" />
