  <title>Christian Philosophy - Evangelist Leon Kabasele</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My first book, Jesus Christ Is My God, explained that in this world, we are not alone; somebody said, Your families will abandon you, your husband or wife or boyfriend or girlfriend will forsake you, but Jesus Christ will never let you go. Even on a hospital bed, he will be there with you. 
My second book, Spiritual Development, is about how you can develop both spiritually and physically. The book discusses all sixteen chapters of the book of Romans, especially as it connects to your life today. The book also discusses the book of Philemon. Those two books analyse biblical passages from Jewish and Christian versions of the holy book. I have a keen eye for etymology and offer finely detailed explanations of many of the original Hebrew and Greek terms in the Bible. 
This book, Christian Philosophy: Understanding Racial Oppression, discusses Christian philosophy and the ideology of colonisation. This book discusses many Christian issues, including creation and how this world functions. I think this book can tell you many top secrets. This book was written with my understanding of Christian philosophy in this modern time. The book does not reveal private secrets but exposes some things that need to be found; this is an idea of archeology without physical digging." />
