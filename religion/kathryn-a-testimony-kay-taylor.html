  <title>Kathryn: a Testimony - Kay Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Looking at the well-packed boxes, my eyes focused on a box of binders containing many unfinished writings of Kathryn. Like a moth drawn to the light, my heart yearned to feel every word. As I attempted to put the pieces together, I realized it was already complete. Treasures of truth like nuggets of gold flowed from its pages. Each nugget intended to fill my heart with healing, comfort, and joy, which started to mend my heart with each word that she left. Kathryn told me, You will be OK, you will be OK. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought if I shared Kathryn, I would not lose her. Losing any loved one is devastating, to say the least. There is something so absolutely unnatural about losing your child. We have in our heads that our parents will go first, then we will, and last our children. So I picked up a pen to share a very remarkable person. Through my grief, often with blinding tears and thoughts of giving up and going to bed, I pulled the covers over my head. I would read a nugget that Kathryn left. Soon I realized that the little nuggets of gold kept drawing me more and more. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One nugget at a time, and there will be an explosion in your spirit. The beauty that surrounds you, its comfort, healing, and joy . . . its God! I soon realized that by sharing her nuggets, her heart would be shared too. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will meet a very special young lady. As she walked through the storm of storms with courage, joy, and an unshakeable faith, she lived life to the fullest every day. Daily, Kathryn would write. Each binder titled, chapters, dedications, verses set to a perfection. I would get so frustrated at all the books. Every day I would say, Just write one, and get it finished. As I concluded all my writing here, I realized that her books werent finished because all her writings were a road map to the book that was to be written. You see, she was the book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
