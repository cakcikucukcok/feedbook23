      <meta name="description" content="Best book of the year!
Said a man who subscribes to
The New York Times
You need to give yourself more credit! 
Remember that great idea you gave up on? The idea people called, crazy? Bad news for you, I took it and made a fortune! Well, actually, I made your fortune. I just get to keep the money! Because thats what I do, I talk you out of your best ideas and then I cash them in. So heres a tip: Stop listening to negative advice, and start believing in your own thinking for change. Who am I to give you advice? Im that pesky spirit of doubt and Ive cost you a fortune. Its not exactly the gig I was hoping for back when I walked in your same shoes, and trust me, you dont want it either! So start believing that your thoughts have value and that your dreams, matter. Its time to knock the dust off your ambition and then get ready, because your life is about to go for a ride. One final note: The contents of this book will stick in your mind like super-glue to your fingers, so remember, youve been warned!
Fact or fiction?
You can decide for yourself. But keep an aspirin handy just in case.
