  <title>Purpose in the Fourth Quarter - Bernie Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life can be perceived as a game very much like football, with four quarters and a break in the middle. In Purpose in the Fourth Quarter, author Bernie Brown describes how life is often difficult and challenging but can still be the most rewarding, satisfying, and wonderful game played on the face of the earth.  
As in the game of football, each quarter has a distinct purpose; in life, the fourth has some unique characteristics. Health and wealth can weigh heavily. In some cases there is a two minute warning or a sudden death overtime. One thing is certain, however  the completion of the fourth quarter marks the end of the game.
It is crucial that we understand the game, its rules and score-keeping, its progression and delays, and, most importantly, its true purpose. And, although we face new challenges as we age, the fourth quarter can be filled with just as much joy and purpose as the previous three. Like football, the goal of the game of life is to be victorious. What do you need to do to win? The answer may surprise you." />
