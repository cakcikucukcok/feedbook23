  <title>The Hidden Glory Poured Out - Naedj V. Joseph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anything Ive done that was ultimately worthwhile initially scared me to death. Betty Bender&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hidden Glory Poured Out is a compilation of divine poems inspired by the Holy Spirit through me for other women. It is a breathing guide which illustrates many lifes issues and assists in coping with trials and tribulations that one embark on toward their destiny. &lt;br /&gt;After I got saved, I felt the presence of the Holy Spirit wrapped around me. I was very focused and immovable for the work of God; I mean, I felt nothing would dare deter my focus. Then, life happened&lt;br /&gt;As you read each poem and allow it to speak to your heart, I pray that it reminds you of Gods promises and to be strengthened. I also pray that the Holy Spirit brings you peace and takes you closer to your breakthrough.&lt;br /&gt;I am grateful to God for allowing me to be inspired during my difficult times and in achieving this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truly those God appoints, HE purges and equips&lt;/p&gt;" />
