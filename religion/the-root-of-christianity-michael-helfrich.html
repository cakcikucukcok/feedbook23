  <title>The Root of Christianity - Michael Helfrich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Words mean things and how you use them either maintains there meaning or belittles it and destroys its total value. Such is the word awesome.
When our youth use the word awesome for cars, Androids, or even their girlfriend, they are belittling the words characterization. The word awesome should only be used for the greatness of the Lord God or His works for mankind. It can be used for something that is greater than itself and stands out above all others.
This book cover represents the awesomeness of God and His creation. As the Scripture declares, the universe fits between the span of Gods hand. This is awesome, and it is unfathomable in mans contemplating of it. If this is awesome, how can you compare anything to it?
Our universe is billions of light years across, and we have no knowledge as to its size, for we have nothing to compare it too; however, what does this say about the awesomeness of God. God does not have hands or legs but uses them as idioms for our comprehension. Even with idioms, it is incomprehensible to realize just how awesome God really is.
Scripture speaks of God as omniscient (all-knowing), omnipotent (all-powerful), and omnipresent (everywhere); and with this in mind, He is wisdom and is sovereign (ruler) over all His creation. He is maintaining everything by His character and for His glory, and His ways are above our ways and His thoughts are above our thoughts." />
