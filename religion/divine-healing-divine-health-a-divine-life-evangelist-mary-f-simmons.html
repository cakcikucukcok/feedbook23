  <title>Divine Healing + Divine Health = a Divine Life - Evangelist Mary F. Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We all become ill from time to time. For many, this means large expenses, days off from work or school, and discomfort. Did you know you do not need to suffer from illness? The Great Physician is there to deliver you from sickness.
In her book Divine Healing + Divine Health = A Divine Life: The Three Ds, author Evangelist Mary F. Simmons reminds us of the promise God made to His followers in the garden of Eden. Everyone who embraces His holy words and follows His plan of redemption will have health and wealth. In Psalm 82:6 we are told, That is God in him, through him and as him says I have said, Ye are gods; and all children of the Most High. Simmons shows us how we can live out lives in a way that allows the Lord to take sickness and diseases from our midst. As a result, well live as testaments to His power and glory. 
God has never withdrawn His promise of health and wealth. Divine Healing + Divine Health = A Divine Life: The Three Ds guides us in how to take advantage of the unique opportunity to embrace health throughout our lives and be free of diseases, sickness, or untimely death. Today is the day you can begin your transition to a guaranteed divine life." />
