  <title>Pain My Best Friend - Leonard Lucas Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God said that he wouldnt put more on you than you could bear, so why is it unbearable? God said that his grace is sufficient for you, but where is the grace? And he said he would offer you mercy, but where is the mercy? So you find yourself depleted of grace, without mercy, and suffering from the unbearable. You are, as the apostle Paul said, Troubled on every side, perplexed, persecuted, and cast down. You are ready to give up.
Pain My Best Friend tells you not to give up! Author Chief Apostle Leonard Lucas Jr. addresses the pain you may be experiencing, and he encourages you to suffer through itGod has the ultimate plan for your life. Chief Apostle Lucas explains how the suffering we all must endure is for the cause of Christ and that no matter how bleak or how intense our pain, we must remain steadfast and remember that God is in control.
Enduring pain is difficult, and it is easy to allow the roots of bitterness to take a deep hold. Even though experiences or circumstances may seem unbearable, we must continue to die so that we may live. Suffer through on this journeyand you will never be alone." />
