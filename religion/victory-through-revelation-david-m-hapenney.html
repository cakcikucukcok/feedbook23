  <title>Victory Through Revelation - David M. Hapenney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Victory through Revelation: Overcoming the Antichrist Spirit is written for those of us who believe in the power of God to fashion our lives contrary to compromising influences and disturbing world events. As the title suggests, each of us can experience the revelation of Jesus Christ to bring us into complete victory, even over the most deceptive human philosophy. 
Many authors present the events described in the book of Revelation outside the context of the book. Victory through Revelation: Overcoming the Antichrist Spirit upholds the unity of Revelation, so we as servants of Christ can hear what He is saying to us in connection to the events seen by the apostle John. Because of the focus on Gods power to transform us into His conquering people, Victory through Revelation also opens a fresh understanding of the last days. It introduces a paradigm to shift us as individuals and the church of the twenty-first century from living in struggle and defeat to experiencing victory upon victory. 
Victory through Revelation shows how achieving victory through the revelation of Christ is essential for living daily for God in an increasingly immoral and godless world, and it underscores the guarantee of our eternal victory no matter what transpires. 
Those of us who want the power of the revelation of Christ to raise us to life in order to escape the things that are about to come upon the world would do well to read Victory through Revelation: Overcoming the Antichrist Spirit." />
