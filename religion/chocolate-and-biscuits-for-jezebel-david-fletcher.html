  <title>Chocolate and Biscuits for Jezebel - David Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This insightful narrative makes an effort to chronicle the celestial warfare foisted by a supreme enemy upon a hapless southern boy of remedial intelligence and insufficient means to respond in kind.  An assembly of memoirs initially, it transcends historical recall and eventually matures into a regal tablet of wisdom.  In doing so, it draws heavily from Biblical truths and in conclusion it hangs its hopes on vivid warnings to those souls unaware of the dangers of succumbing to Jezebels spell.
       From open-minded evangelicals to renaissance rednecks throughout the book-reading world, there is something between the covers to spur a giggle or a gag from the presence of this story on their bookshelves.  Intellectuals in need of cerebral samples for academic study would most likely find Chocolate and Biscuits for Jezebel an absolute requirement in the halls of investigative psychoses.  It will provide them with an endless source of amusement.
       Most of all, though, there will exist a written legacy of one life lived and the deductions wrought from it.  Perhaps it may serve as an explanation as to why weve all come up short in the race of life.  Hell, Ive even laughed at some of it.
       Deemed by some as &quot;courageously personal&quot;, it draws equal billing as &quot;slightly entertaining&quot;.  This books content seems to pluck a chord in each and every personality who has taken the time to browse the pages." />
