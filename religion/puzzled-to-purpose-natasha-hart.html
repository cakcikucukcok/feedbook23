We like using the phrase, thats just life when we dont know what else to attribute to our lack of connection with who and what we really want to be when we grow up. It was in this pondering and puzzling moment of my life that God began to show me piece by piece how connection to my many just life experiences really did matter. You were not created by accident, and nor will you find your purpose by accident. It wasn&#39;t easy sharing some of the stories of my life, but I truly want someone else to know what God has taken time to let me know. You have to be willing to share pieces of your life and begin the process of connecting. You can go from puzzled to purpose by doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;" />
