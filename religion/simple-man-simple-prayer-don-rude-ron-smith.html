  <title>Simple Man Simple Prayer - Don Rude, Ron Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since the collapse of the dot.com bubble beginning in 2000, America has been careening, with ever-increasing speed, from one social, political, or financial crisis to the next with little or no resolution to any of the problems. In the middle of all this is a tidal wave of anecdotal stories and a growing body of statistical evidence that millions of men are seeing their role and value being diminished, if not eliminated, in society, at work, and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why worry about men when everyone knows men are the least vulnerable, and it is the women and children who bear the brunt of harsh economic and social conditions? Being classified as among the least vulnerable is no consolation to the man who has lost his job and is now unable to provide for his family, or the man who is routinely passed over for promotions and raises because of his age, gender, or race, or the man who finds himself in a household where his wife has become the primary breadwinner while his own career is in decline. Unless a man is is spiritually grounded through a relationship with Jesus Christ, it can be almost impossible to stand against the worlds attacks against his manhood and self esteem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple Man Simple Prayer offers men a starting point to building a daily relationship with God and become the man God intended him to be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
