  <title>Blessed Beyond Measure - Alan Wheeler, Allison Shea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We have been both blessed and cursed with today&amp;rsquo;s technological advancements. BLESSED, due to the integration between electronic devises&amp;mdash;CURSED, due to the segregation between family members. Today we have our smartphones to entertain us and the internet to inform us, SO why bother conversing with another human? In the average home today, it is not uncommon to see every family member quarantined in their own little space, engrossed in their own little cyber world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This preoccupation with the cyber world has caused many to neglect the most important and needful source of interaction. Some of the greatest advice and wisdom to be had, can be found in one&amp;rsquo;s own family; but it is often left untapped, due to the lack of communication among family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, there were no technological gadgets (such as we have today) that hindered me from interacting with my family. While growing up, there was nothing I enjoyed more than spending time with my Grandpas. This book is about those times I spent with my Grandpas and the valuable lessons I learned from them. I didn&amp;rsquo;t need video games to entertain me or a computer to inform me&amp;mdash;I had my Grandpas! I didn&amp;rsquo;t need a Super Hero to fascinate me or a Famous Athlete to influence me&amp;mdash;I had my Grandpas! My Grandpas were My Real Life Heroes! They gave me all the love and support that any one grandson could ever need!&lt;/p&gt;" />
