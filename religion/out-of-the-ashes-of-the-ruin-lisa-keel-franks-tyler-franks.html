  <title>Out of the Ashes of the Ruin - Lisa Keel Franks, Tyler Franks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;I want to share my personal testimony&lt;/b&gt; to leave a legacy for the future generation to see how the LORD God desires relationship with us as His creation. Since the fall of man, we are all born into a sinful nature. It is up to each one of us on this journey of life to recognize the need for a Savior at the time it pleases God to reveal himself to you. Once your spiritual eyes are open, and you have allegiance with God through Christ Jesus, there will be trials and tribulations here on earth. I share to entice readers to consider their position with God and to encourage fellow Christians to overcome and live in victory. All the answers to life&#39;s concerns and the need for guidance are written in the Word of God, the Holy Inspired Bible. Our sacrifice is to praise Him, as singer Kristian Stanfill voiced in the lyrics: &quot;Oh, Praise the one who paid my debt and raised this life up from the dead.&quot; Yes, He did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Romans 12:1 ESV&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyler&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Romans 12:2 ESV&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Shane&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;&quot;Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.&quot;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Romans 12:12 ESV&lt;/p&gt;
