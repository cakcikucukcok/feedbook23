  <title>The Complete Mahabharata (Volume 4 of 4, Books 13 to 18) - Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; tells the narrative of the Kurukshetra War and the fates of the Kaurava and the Pandava princes who are part of it. Along with the &quot;Ramayana&quot; it is one of two Sanskrit epics of ancient India. The authorship of the work is generally attributed to Vyasa, who is also a major character in the epic. Intermixed within the descriptions of conflict between the warring factions of this epic are numerous philosophical digressions and discussions of Hinduism. One of the more famous of these digressions is the &quot;Bhagavad-Gita&quot;, a battlefield conversation between Pandava prince Arjuna and his guide Lord Krishna on a variety of theological and philosophical issues. Also included within the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; are the story of &quot;Damayanti&quot; and &quot;Rishyasringa,&quot; often considered as works in their own right. This sweeping epic, the longest every written in Sanskrit, is widely considered as one of the most important works to ever be authored in any language. This four volume edition collects together the complete epic in a translation by Kisari Mohan Ganguli. Here we have the fourth volume which includes books thirteen through eighteen." />
