  <title>A Simple Approach to Taoism - Khoo Boo Eng</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most people would look at Taoism as a religion per se.  If one is not familiar with Taoism, one would be surprised that the concepts of feng-shui, astrology, geography, traditional medicine, Yin-Yang and many others influencing modern western cultures are, in fact, Taoism concepts!
Others had ideas of Taoism steeped in rituals, branded as superstitious and even looked at it with apprehension. It is quite understandable as the concepts and culture of Taoism hardly cross the path of the Western world.  Taoism remains deeply rooted in the Far East and its propagation to the world is rather slow and lethargic.
A Simple Approach to Taoism  of Gods and Deities and together with A Simple Approach to Taoism  Festivals, Worship and Rituals will provide in a simple to understand language, yet vivid and alluring, the basic history, concept and the rich, colourful culture of Taoism.
The book is organized around four important themes: Historical Development, Religious Taoism, Philosophical Taoism and Taoist Gods and Deities.  It also touches on certain aspects of the sacred texts such as the Tao Te Ching.
The section on Gods and Deities will help the reader to understand the building blocks of Taoism and provides an in-depth understanding and appreciation of the more important gods and deities of the Chinese pantheon. 
Let then the journey begins, slowly unfolding the vast ocean of Taoism, its beliefs, culture and traditions.     ** For book two please refer to the blurb gib" />
