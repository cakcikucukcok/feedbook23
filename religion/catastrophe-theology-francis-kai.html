  <title>Catastrophe Theology - Francis Kai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Catastrophe Theology is a theology learned by Francis Kai throughout the years he was thrown into the Valley of Achor. Although he had been a Catholic from ten years old, Francis did not know to receive grace from God in deep suffering when his wife, Martha, was diagnosed with brain cancer. During his search for spiritual help, Francis discovered Martin Luther was the first theologian to preach suffering.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Luthers doctrine of justification by faith alone is the doctrine of salvation by grace alone through faith alone. Grace is the free gift of God to mankind. A Christian must learn the way to receive grace through his faith in Christ. Francis learned to receive grace by learning Luthers teaching: Submit totally to God. He was transformed from living his church life to Christian life.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God calls us to bear great fruit for his glory in this suffering world. Francis learned the verse of John 14:12 from Pastor Scott Scruggs to do greater things than Jesus by telling his readers about the theology of suffering. A church that does not preach suffering is not Gods church. Francis learned to be a godly man from living a life in doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
