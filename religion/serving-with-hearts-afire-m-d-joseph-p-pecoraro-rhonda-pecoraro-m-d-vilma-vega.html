  <title>Serving With Hearts Afire - M.D. Joseph P. Pecoraro, Rhonda Pecoraro, M.D. Vilma Vega</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The gospel command is to &amp;ldquo;go&amp;rdquo; into the world, to minister to the sick and the poor, and to bring the good news of Christ and His work on the cross to those who have not heard of Him. Ten people from many different walks of life did just this through Hearts Afire ministry, traveling more than 30,000 miles to foreign lands, not sure what they would find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They answered the call and encountered a risen and vibrant Savior, One who still works in wondrous and mysterious ways today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serving With Hearts Afire&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the mission journeys of ten ordinary people who decided to do extraordinary things. Through their talents and skills, they ministered to countless people&amp;mdash;physically, emotionally, and spiritually. They have made disciples, healed broken bodies, and nourished the souls of children and adults alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And they want you to join them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You, too, can experience the deep satisfaction of the mission field. You can become one of many people using their time and talents to minister to people who might not otherwise receive physical help or care, or hear the gospel message. You, too, can be a contributing part as God works to restore people to Himself. As you read through these pages, imagine yourself in their place, working as the hands and feet of Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Answer the call He is placing on your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go.&lt;/p&gt;" />
