  <title>Chosen Vessel - S. R. Sampson.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let us imagine that Jesus walked among us today, really could you imagine!  What lifestyle would He choose to live?  Would He choose to live in splendor?  Or Would Jesus exhibit simple, humble, loving servant like qualities (the Carpenter), as we know Him in our bible readings?&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Jesus fed the hungry, clothes the needy and was the vessel of truth. Jesus came as a vessel, chosen to set an example, to bring love, grace and redemption.  Yet, Jesus has ascended and is seated at the right hand of the Father. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Jesus came to introduce Gods provision; Gods plan, not to forsaken anyone, all should receive the things that are needed for daily living. God made a plan to supply all of our needs.  There is a provision to take care of all humankind on the earth.  Through the servant-ship of chosen vessels, a plan of survival for humankinds has been put into place.&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;God loves, shows compassion, and gives freely, as it is Gods plan that we honor the commandment to love thy neighbor as thyself.   This is only one of the two most important commandments; the first commandment is to Love God with your whole heart (to have no god before Him), and the second is to love your neighbor as yourself. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;How does God desire that we give and share with our fellow man (neighbor)?   God chose or gifted individuals with the abilities to manage substantial sums of money, and to discern the needs of others. To always give, lovingly and unconditionally, as God gives freely; desiring that as we will give freely.  As we transform our lives to become more like Jesus, to give our time, talent,  and resources as a part of the commitment to living in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we enter into the last days, the gift of giving will manifest, as we reach out to help families of believers and unbelievers.  The last days will be a time where many will need God; spiritually, materially, physically and emotionally, and all needs should be met.  As we give freely to unbelievers and believers; it will reveal Gods grace and love for all people. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Humbly, all should aspire to be like Jesus, to reflect on Gods love for our fellow man and give,  unconditionally? As the reference scripture reveals in Gods Word --- in Matthew 25: 45&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42 For I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink,&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;43 I was a stranger and you did not invite me in, I needed clothes and you did not clothe me, I was sick and in prison and you did not look after me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;44 They also will answer, Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison, and did not help you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45 He will reply, Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these; you did not do for me.&lt;/p&gt;" />
