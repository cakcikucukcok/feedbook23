  <title>Caught up to Heaven with the Holy Spirit - Grace I. George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pleasefor Jesus sake, stop neglecting the Bible, and get it inside you! &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are under demonic attack on an unparalleled scale. Jesus sees your pain and wants to rescue you from darkness, just as he rescued Grace George. It may seem impossible, but with God, nothing is impossible.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This first volume of Caught up to Heaven over 320 times contains a number of testimonies, revelations, dreams, and songs given to Grace by Jesus. Many of the victories she saw in heaven have already happened on earth, including raising the dead to life. Her ministry is a reflection of Luke 4:19: The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to set the oppressed free. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember John 3:16: For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. This is what the Word of God says, and every word in the Scriptures is true.&lt;p&gt;" />
