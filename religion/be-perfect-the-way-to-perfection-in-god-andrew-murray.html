  <title>Be Perfect - The way to perfection in God - Andrew Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God has worked into every human heart a deep desire for perfection. That desire is manifested in the admiration which all men have for excellence in the different objects or pursuits to which they attach value. In the believer who yields himself wholly to God, this desire fastens itself upon God&amp;#39;s wonderful promises, and inspires a prayer like that of M&amp;#39;Cheyne: &amp;quot;Lord, make me as holy as a pardoned sinner can be made.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The more we learn to desire this full conformity to God&amp;#39;s will, for the consciousness that we are always pleasing to Him, we will see that all this must come as a gift direct from heaven. This gift is the full outbirth in us of the life of God, the inbreathing of the Holy Spirit of Jesus in those who are wholly yielded to His indwelling and rule. Trusting ever less to men&amp;#39;s thoughts and teachings, we will retire often into the secret of God&amp;#39;s presence, in the assurance that the more we see God&amp;#39;s face, and hear the secret voice that comes direct from Him, &amp;quot;BE PERFECT,&amp;quot; the more will the Holy Spirit dwelling within us unfold the heavenly fulness and power of the words, and make them, as God&amp;#39;s words, bring and give and create the very thing He speaks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the hope that these simple meditations may help some of God&amp;#39;s children to go on to Perfection, I commit them and myself to the Blessed Father&amp;#39;s teaching and keeping.&lt;br /&gt;
