  <title>A Christian&#39;s View of the Torah - Matt P. Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Christians View of the Torah&lt;/i&gt; is a series of essays illustrating how the Torah uses numerous literary devices often seen in great works of art, such as symbolism, parallelism, reflections, and repeated themes. This book presents the Bible (or at least the Torah) as a unified whole with consistent underlying themes rather than a collection of disjointed stories. And it shows, from the Christian point of view, how the Torah points toward Christ and His church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most biblical study guides fall into two extremes. At one end of the spectrum, they are directed toward the uninitiated or new Christian and are therefore so simplistic that they give no new insights to a Christian wanting to grow. At the other extreme, they are so academic that a doctorate in divinity is required to get anything out of them. A few strive to touch the middle ground, which allows the average Christian to grow and to add to his faith. &lt;i&gt;A Christians View of the Torah&lt;/i&gt; is an attempt to strike the middle ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is not intended as an evangelistic tool but as an aid for those who wish to move from the milk to the meat of the Word and gain some new insights to old familiar stories. It is intended for those who have a working knowledge of the Bible, particularly the Torah, the Historical Books, the Gospels, Acts, and the Epistlesin short, Genesis through Second Chronicles and Matthew through Jude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a single Christians point of view.&lt;/p&gt;" />
