  <title>Jesus Loves Me - Keith D. Pisani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jesus Loves Me: A Follow-Up Guide for Children is a four-session study guide designed to help younger believers grow in Christ. Based on the words of a popular childrens song, Jesus Loves Me is the younger believers first phase of follow-up and introduces the new convert to the basics of Christianity. The four sessions include the reading content of instructive opening paragraphs, fill-in-the-blank questions, matching, some memorization, and some writing. All answers are included in the back of the text. The minimal qualifications needed to use the follow-up materials as a discipler are as follows: the discipler must be a believer, and the discipler must be able to read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with scripture, the lessons in this interactive book include training notes for the discipler and studies on the following topics: a review of the salvation experience, sin, the gospel, assurance, scripture memorization, spiritual growth, prayer, the Bible, witnessing, living the Christ life, the Lords return, guarding against temptation, church attendance, baptism, the Lords supper, church membership, and fellowship with other believers. Also, a lesson on how to study the Bible is included at the end of the book.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Other discipleship books by Keith D. Pisani include Spiritual Lessons for New Believers, Spiritual Lessons for Growing Believers, and Spiritual Lessons for Growing Believers Workbook. All three are published by WestBow Press.&lt;/p&gt;" />
