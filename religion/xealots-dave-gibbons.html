  <title>Xealots - Dave Gibbons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We thirst for purpose, clarity, fulfillment and direction in our lives. How do we go about sorting through all the self-help books, talks and seminars? The common, normal solutions to navigating life are focused on strengths, gifts, and passion. The reality is quite contrarian to what seems to make sense. The revelations is found in the divine fingerprints of all that we are: our life story, what energized and de-energizes us, our rhythms, and even our pain and weaknesses. It’s a different way of approaching clarity of life.At the heart of this book is the understanding that a life filled with passion is radically different than what many of us have been taught. Often it’s not in the how do we find life but a commitment to a passionate pursuit. Neurologically, if we ask the question how our brains can’t tap the new domains, our brains resorts to typical default solutions that are often inadequate. The way to live life to its fullest is found in abnormal rhythms and principles, that have the tension of questions more than answers.  It’s a place where strategy is important but an ethos where relationships trump vision. The way we are invited to live life to its fullest is found with a contrarian set of beliefs, values and questions. It’s not about quick fixes and simplistic “solutions.”. God works through our weaknesses and our failures.  Real vision is found through relationships with God and with other people.  Obedience is better than passion.  These contrarian concepts have been presented and tested in many business and non-profit settings, including Willow Creek’s Leadership Summit where Dave gave a keynote address. The tone of this book was established as Dave thought about what he would want to share with his four third culture children and future leaders. It was Dave’s heart that they would walk a life where they experienced life to it’s fullest, exploring the new and old domains of world that is constantly changing." />
