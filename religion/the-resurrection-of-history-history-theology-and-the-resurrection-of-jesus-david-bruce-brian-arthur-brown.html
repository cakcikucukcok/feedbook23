  <title>The Resurrection of History: History, Theology, and the Resurrection of Jesus - David Bruce, Brian Arthur Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Did Jesus really rise from the dead? And does it really matter? In The Resurrection of History, David Bruce explores what historians, theologians, and New Testament scholars have said about the resurrection of Jesus from a historical point of view. Bruce argues that scholars don&#39;t have to dismiss the scriptural witness that &quot;he is risen&quot; as metaphor or wishful thinking. Bruce examines the development of the art of history writing and explores the theological possibilities now open to scholars in the twenty-first century. Using contemporary examples, Bruce helps his readers come to grips with the interrelationship of history and theology and think like theologically-informed historians. Respectful of varying points of view, Bruce defends the traditional, orthodox view of the resurrection and challenges his readers to consider the implications for Christian faith and witness if, in fact, the resurrection of Jesus was historical." />
