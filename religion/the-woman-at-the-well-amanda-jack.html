  <title>The Woman at the Well - Amanda Jack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dearly beloved, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where do you run to when you are stuck between a rock and a hard place? Are you wondering how did I get here and how will I turn it around? The good news is that there is a real answer to your real problem. There is a way out, and it starts with a simple decision to leave where you are now and go to your secret place, to meet the King of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Woman at the Well is a woman that is cognizant of her limitations, faults, potential and wants more than what she currently has. She is a woman that has a burning in her soul and is seeking an honorable outlet for that fire. She is thirsty for what she doesn&#39;t know, but she is well aware that without it she is less than who she is meant to be. She may be battered, torn, bruised even hurt but she knows that is not how her story ends. So she embarks on a journey of discovery, rediscovery, love and beauty in the presence of the Lord accompanied by His Holy Spirit. A journey that will forever change the course of her life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grace to you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ&lt;/p&gt;" />
