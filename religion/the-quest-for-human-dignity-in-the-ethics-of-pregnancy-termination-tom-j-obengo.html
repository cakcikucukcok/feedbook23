  <title>The Quest for Human Dignity in the Ethics of Pregnancy Termination - Tom J. Obengo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Quest for Human Dignity in the Ethics of Pregnancy Termination describes and analyzes the problem of termination of pregnancy, with special attention to its prevalence in Kenya, where more than seven hundred abortions are performed daily on girls between fifteen and seventeen years of age. Although pregnancy termination is illegal in Kenya, its practice goes on in the rural villages, in homes, in urban streets, and in private clinics. The book focuses on the ethical quest for human dignity in the context of the church&#39;s response to the challenge of termination of pregnancy. It examines the perceptions and attitudes of various cadres of Christians, such as church ministers, doctors, and lawyers, towards the problem. The book proposes ways and means by which the church in Kenya can approach the challenge of termination of pregnancy, including those pregnancies arising out of rape and incest. Findings support the current legal framework that prohibits pregnancy termination, but reveal a desire for change in the way the church deals with members who get unplanned pregnancies and those who terminate the same. The book suggests, in addition, that the church&#39;s role should emphasize counseling, teaching, and pastoral care, rather than ex-communication and public rebuke." />
