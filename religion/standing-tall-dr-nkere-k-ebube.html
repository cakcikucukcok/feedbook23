  <title>Standing Tall - Dr. Nkere K. Ebube</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is not simply a narrative about the struggles that we go through in life, geared towards making the reader feel good or evoke a sense of self-pity. It is an inspirational book based strictly on sound biblical principles. The underlying message is that trial in the life of a Christian is not an extraordinary event, but that God does extraordinary things in our lives through it, particularly as we get His attention through our obedience, humility, steadfast faith and unwavering belief in His promises. This book contains numerous biblical references to strengthen you, whether you are currently experiencing a storm, in a period of calm or just stepping into the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God can meet you at any point in your life. He is the only one who is capable of changing your circumstances or turning any broken vessel into a masterpiece for His glory. You do not need to explain to Him where you are for He already knows. Christ is our perfect intercessor. He has cleansed our ugly past with His blood, and our salvation is secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no type of trial that is new before the Lord. He would make a way of escape according to His will. Seek His face diligently in prayer, and do not let the circumstances of life overwhelm you. Remain strong in your faith, and continue to stand by His promises. Our Lord is a faithful God. He would grant you peace and strength in your adversity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
