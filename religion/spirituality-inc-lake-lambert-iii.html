  <title>Spirituality, Inc. - Lake Lambert Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For many Americans spirituality and business seem to be polar opposites: one is concerned with lofty questions of ultimate significance, the other with mundane matters of the daily grind. Yet over the last two decades the two have become increasingly linked, and as the barriers between them are broken down, many see this as a revolutionary shift in American business culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lake Lambert III provides a comprehensive examination of the workplace spirituality movement, and explores how it is both shaping and being shaped by American business culture. Situating the phenomenon in an historical context, Lambert surveys the role of spirituality in business from medieval guilds to industrial &amp;quot;company towns&amp;quot; right up to current trends in the ever-changing contemporary business environment. Using case studies from specific businesses, such as Chick-fil-A and Hobby Lobby, he analyzes the enhanced benefits and support that workplace spirituality offers to employees, while exposing the conflicts it engenders, including diversity, religious freedom, and discrimination issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The American workplace today is experiencing dramatic upheaval and change. &lt;b&gt;Spirituality, Inc.&lt;/b&gt; offers important insights into the role of religion in this transformation. With employees seeking new ways to strike a proper life-work balance and find meaning in their everyday lives, spirituality in the workplace is a trend that will become increasingly important in the American business landscape. &lt;b&gt;Spirituality, Inc.&lt;/b&gt; provides a critical overview of this phenomenon that does not ignore the movement&#39;s many positive contributions to the workplace, yet does not overlook the potential for abuse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
