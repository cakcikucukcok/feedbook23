Father Rafael Mara Fabretto was an Italian priest who moved to Nicaragua with the purpose of opening and managing an orphanage . . . It was a catastrophic failure. Father Fabrettos experiment almost killed me, together with other kids who were rescued at the brink of starvation. Ironically, it was Anastasio Somoza (the father, the first member of the Somoza dynasty) who saved our lives . . . The continuum works in marvelous ways; just picture a hated, soft-hearted tyrant being impacted by the sight of more than 300 children starving to death. I bet his conscience screamed to his inner ears that he was going to be blamed if some of those children were to die . . . Somoza was moved by the continuum to do what is atypical of dictators, an act of love.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
