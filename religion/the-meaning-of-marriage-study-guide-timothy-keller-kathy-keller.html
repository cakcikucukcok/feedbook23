  <title>The Meaning of Marriage Study Guide - Timothy Keller, Kathy Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Modern culture would have you believe that everyone has a soul mate; that romance is the most important part of a successful marriage; that marriage does not mean &#39;til death do us part, but merely for as long as my needs are being met; and that when serious differences arise, divorce is the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, all of these modern-day assumptions miss what marriage is all about. In this&amp;nbsp;six-session video-based Bible study (DVD/digital video sold separately), Timothy Keller, along with Kathy, his wife of forty years, draws a profound portrait of marriage from the&amp;nbsp;pages of Scripture that neither idealizes nor rejects the institution but points us back to the relationship between God and man. The result is a vision for&amp;nbsp;marriage that is refreshingly frank and unsentimental, yet hopeful and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study is for anyone from singles to couples considering&amp;nbsp;marriage to those who have been married recently or for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sessions include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Service: Marriage Isn&#39;t about You&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Covenant: Created to Make Promises&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roles: Loving through Mutual Submission&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Singleness: Strengthening the Spiritual Family&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sex: The Act of Covenant Renewal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hope: Seeing the Great Horizon&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed for use with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Marriage Video Study&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(sold separately).&lt;/p&gt;" />
