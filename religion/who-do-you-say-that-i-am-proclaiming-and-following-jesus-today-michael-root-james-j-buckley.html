  <title>Who Do You Say That I Am?: Proclaiming and Following Jesus Today - Michael Root, James J. Buckley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="No question is more central to Christian living, preaching, and theology than Jesus&#39; question to his disciples: Who do you say that I am? Some would have it that pastors and theologians, biblical exegetes and historians, dogmatic and moral theologians, Catholic and Evangelical have more differences than similarities in the way Christians with such diverse vocations respond to Jesus&#39; question. And there is little doubt that there sometimes seem to be unbridgeable gulfs between the way historians and believers, Internet gossipers and preachers, classical christological debates and present-day praying and pastoral care implicitly or explicitly address the Lord&#39;s question. But the authors here address these and other issues in ways that are remarkably convergent, as if a &quot;Catholic and Evangelical theology&quot; for proclaiming and following Jesus today has emerged, or is indeed emerging." />
