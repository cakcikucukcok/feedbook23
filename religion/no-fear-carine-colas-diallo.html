  <title>No Fear - Carine Colas Diallo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No Fear is about my decision to relinquish my total being to God when I was young. An inner voiceGods voicehad become a permanent part of me, speaking to me and advising me in times of trouble and danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My father was born in Haiti and could not provide any religious support to me and my siblings. However, my mother, who is also Haitian, a Christian, and an advocate of prayer, pushed and encouraged me to grow closer to God through prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was a high school student almost thirty years ago, thank God my inner voiceGods voicespoke loudly and clearly to my conscious being. As I was heading into the girls locker room to change for tennis practice, all of a sudden, I heard my inner voice command me to leave the school building. At the entrance, I encountered a teenage boy standing there, who violently grabbed my arm and was trying to pull down his pants with his other hand. I kicked him hard in his groin, which forced him to the ground. I was free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years later, when I was a Peace Corps volunteer working in Guinea, West Africa, the government compound where I was living was attacked by an angry mob seeking revenge on a political figure whom they believed was corrupt. The night before, my inner voiceGods voiceinstructed me to pack a small bag. I escaped unharmed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
