  <title>A Bible Blanket - Beverly Foote</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If we regard life as a school where we have the opportunity to grow in love toward ourselves and toward others as well as to learn from our mistakes, The Holy Bible serves as a textbook to guide us on this journey. For each chapter of the Old and New Testaments, I have written a sentence or two to indicate how the chapter has enlightened or inspired me. In sharing these insights, I hope to encourage you, dear reader, to use the Bible as a teaching tool and guide in lifes journey. The Bible illustrates not only human shortcomings but also inspires hope that allows us to move from fear to love, from a sense of scarcity to a sense of abundance, from a sense of shame to a sense of peace, from a sense of anger to a sense of forgiveness, and from a sense of separation to a sense of oneness. Some readers may want to embark on a program of daily Bible reading, turning afterward to A Bible Blanket for assurance and inspiration. Other readers may simply want to read A Bible Blanket as a summary of the good news offered in The Holy Bible. Either way, may this book provide blessed assurance of Gods unconditional love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
