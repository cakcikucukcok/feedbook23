  <title>Controversies Quieted by the Sword - Belinda B. Dickerson  M.A.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The author gives a diligent and careful investigation into the history and teachings of the Christian faith and church as they relate to poignant and timely contemporary controversies and issues facing modern-day Christianity. From questions about the role and place of women in the church and of the church itself, to issues related to homosexuality and the nature of the spirit world, the author provides a detailed and well-refined study that should pique the curiosity of believers and help guide them towards God&#39;s true answers to these complex theological and doctrinal questions. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inasmuch as Christ, Peter, Paul, and the prophets taught in the simplicity in the Word, some topics they taught were hard to understand or controversial to the traditional reader. The purpose of this book is to shed light upon a few of those controversial subjects in hope of expounding unto the reader the way of God more perfectly. &lt;p&gt;" />
