  <title>Be Who God Made You To Be - Steven Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder what God&amp;rsquo;s plan for your life really is? Do you find yourself wondering if you&amp;rsquo;ll ever measure up? In a world that is so performance driven, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get caught up in the lies of what is acceptable. Our Christian culture has been affected by these lies. Do you think there seems to be more emphasis on what we do, instead of who we are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus said, &amp;ldquo;Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which in heaven.&amp;rdquo; So what kind of good works? How do I know they will be good enough? What light is Jesus referring to? Questions, questions, questions. Many that have been brought on by a performance driven religion disguised as Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like many Christians, I struggled with these same issues. After many years of reading His word, God started to show me something different. Then, He inspired me to write this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING: This book will not change your life. Only God can do that, but you have to make a conscious decision to let Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line is this. God loves you. He created you. There is no one like you anywhere. He wants you to shine for His glory, and all you have to do is...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE WHO GOD MADE YOU TO BE.&lt;/p&gt;" />
