  <title>The Speaking God - Denny Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you heard Him speak to you? What did He say? How did you respond? In the process of relating with the living God, you want to learn how to hear the whispers of His voice. You want to discern the nuances of His language. His sheep know His voice (John 10:27). The best way to position yourself to hear the Lord is to meet with Him every day and read His Word, invite His presence, and fellowship with the Holy Spirit. Your purposeful intention gains His attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most effective and practical tool to impact your personal time with God may be having a devotional that coincides with your Bible reading. Having another Spirit-inspired perspective to accompany you can pave the way for eye-opening revelation. And by looking beneath the surface you are able to gain a fuller perspective. In turn, you are drawn closer to God, and you build confidence in knowing what His heart is for you. It validates that you are hearing Him. The discovery of hearing God brings delightful satisfaction to your spirit and triggers a hunger for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Speaking God is a daily through-the-Bible devotional that will encourage you in your walk with the Lord. The bite size format will get right to the point and give you plenty to ponder. The concluding prayer makes it personal and practical.&lt;/p&gt;" />
