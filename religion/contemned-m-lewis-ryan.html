  <title>Contemned - M. Lewis Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Contemned, is the story of a scorned woman named Genesis and her revelation after she missed the rapture. The revelation of true evil lying in wait to expose itself within each and every one left on earth. Genesis thought she was a Christian and knew she would be saved. She attended church every Sunday. She is a divorced mother of two kids, a teenage boy called BJ and an eight year old daughter called JoJo. Gen is a hard worker with an average social life. Upon her mothers request, she opened her home to her sister and her two younger children. She thought she was handling the stress just fine. She hadnt killed her ex-husband and his Bimbo Barbies and her estranged, man-hungry, unsocialable, not quite divorced yet sister who was driving her insane daily. She even sung in the choir at her church, but none of that mattered. She still missed the rapture. 
	It was an average day. Genesis was looking forward to the night. She and her girlfriends were going to DJs Blue Note Caf to listen to the poetic sound of spoken words by the featured spoken word artists. It was the true blues scene, the bass player wearing his dark shades, the sax player, oh my God that man is hot, the drummer, and the artists expressing the inner feelings and thoughts she dare not say. Mix the element with a couple of glasses of White Zinfandel and maybe a shot of Patron or E&amp;J, depending on the mood and it becomes chill time.  It wasnt until the next morning when her son rushed into their home asking, screaming that she realizes something is terribly wrong. Why didnt God take us Mom, why? BJ kept repeating. The rapture had come and gone and questions are overwhelming her ability to think. What happens next is the only thought on Genesis mind. Her curiosity of why she was not taken haunted her soul. Her mother had been her link to heaven, and now her mother, JoJo and Bris kids were gone. Follow them through their struggle with self-identity and trials and tribulations to escape from a satanic world. The mark of the beast is all around them as they attempt to travel from Texas to Israel. How will they survive and will they make it?" />
