  <title>Revelations of Jesus Christ: Predetermined End - Donald Hunter Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Revelations of Jesus Christ: Predetermined End is a message to the body of Christ about the coming and evil days. The Lord said, Now learn the parable of the fig tree; when his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors. The Lord has called his people to be discerners of the signs of the times that we might be aware of the seasons of God. This book reveals the signs, and prepares the saints for the evil days to come. This book highlights the coming world Kingdom Mystery Babylon, then the following Kingdom of the 10 Kings, which will be given to the Beast and the subsequent Kingdom of Jesus Christ, which shall destroy the Beast. Moreover, this book take us through the 1000 year reign of Jesus Christ to the Battle of Gog and Magog, and ends with the destruction of this current planet earth, the final judgment and the creation of a new heaven and new earth, wherein only the righteous will be in the presence of God and the Lamb forever and ever." />
