  <title>Bible - Dr. James Krieger, Dd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will teach you spiritual and physical healing. Truth is its own self-movement within itself, as in John 14:20 and Ephesians 4:37, only by 1 John 2:27. Truth is actually as in John 14:6 and 17:17 and Ephesians 5:26, which is Hebrews 13:8.
Truth will only prevail for those that live in truth, John 16:13 by 1 John 2:27, which is John 8:32, only by Matthew 11:2530.
This book is based on science, facts, and history with a paper trail that you can followarchitectural digs and finds and Egyptian history.
Christianity came from the Samaritans religion, Canaanites religion, Egyptians religion, Hebrew religion, Greek religion, and Roman religion.
With all the old holy books (the Latter Rain), which are being found since 1945, it was hearsay to read, study, or teach from because it will show many contradictions, fables, lies, half truths, untrue stories, and the imagination of man and his belief of theology and doctrine.
All I am doing is James 5:1920, so when and if you ask (Romans 10:13) God to help you get out of Revelations 18:4 and break all yokes and bondage and take you out of slavery, Matthew 11:2530, hethe fullness of God Jesus the Holy One, the Father of Light (John 1:118)will guide you to John 14:6 and 17:17 and Ephesians 5:2627 so you will be 1 Peter 1:18.
This book needs to be read with an open mind, a loving Spirit, a Humble and crying soul for truth, and a hungry heart for truth." />
