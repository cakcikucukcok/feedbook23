  <title>100 Days - 100 Pages - Raghubir Lal Anand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Incredible India is beautiful in all its aspects. We have natural paradise on earth called Jammu &amp; Kashmir. It is the abode of Bharat Mata (Maa Vaishno Devi); a valley full of vibrant natural beauties and large inventories of flora &amp; fauna which is not found anywhere on this mother earth. We have a variety of climate types like we have got summers, pre-winter (Hemant Ritu), winters, springs, autumn and monsoon. My beautiful country has rich geography and history of centuries. The unique Indian culture is not found anywhere in the world. If you look at anything you will find something divine; you can never hurt or harm anything, either in nature or in human beings. The people of India are known as Hindi (as told by the Arabs to Hindus). This country is called Hindustan and people living here are called Hindus as they believe that people of India have Hinduism as their religion. But I say this country is Bharat Khande and people living here are Bharatiyas. Englishmen termed this country as India and people living here as Indians. Hinduism gives a message that Hindus belief lies in Satya and Ahimsah (truth and non-violence), meaning Hindus can never hurt or harm anything either in nature or in living beings. Thus, the Hindus had never wanted to conquer, or control, anything except their own brains. India has never invaded any country in the last 10,000 years of its history. This is the finest prize that can be given to this culture and one that shows its genius." />
