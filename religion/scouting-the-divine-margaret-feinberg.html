  <title>Scouting the Divine - Margaret Feinberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beloved Bible teacher Margaret Feinberg invites you on a remarkable spiritual adventure to live more courageous and free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bible is full of clever plots and compelling stories, laced with historic insights and literary beauty. But despite its richness and depth, many of us struggle to close the gap between the ancient world and our own. What does it mean to know that Jesus is the Good Shepherd when the only place you&#39;ve encountered sheep is at a petting zoo? How can you understand the promise of a land overflowing with honey when you buy yours in a bear-shaped bottle? Can you grasp the urgency of Jesus&#39; invitation to abide in the vine when you shop for grapes at a local grocery store?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Margaret invites you to accompany her on the adventure of a lifetime - across the nation to herd sheep in Oregon, harvest fields with a Nebraska farmer, prune vines in California, and explore hives with a veteran beekeeper in Colorado. Along the way, you&#39;ll explore how ancient livelihoods illuminate meaningful truths that apply to life today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I asked one question to each person, &#39;How do you read the Scriptures in light of what you do every day?&#39;&quot; she writes. &quot;Their answers changed the way I read the Bible forever.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her trademark humor and vulnerability, you&#39;ll learn the secret of how to live like you have a shepherd, unlock the sweetest promises of God, and discover the gift of divine timing. You&#39;ll move from simply reading Scripture to entering stories that can be touched and tasted, smelled and savored.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Scouting the Divine&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;will revolutionize the way you understand the Bible - and leave you wonderstruck by the magnificence of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
