  <title>The Lion and the Lamb - Monica Map, Hadassah Esther</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book seeks to provoke a discussion with our children:&lt;br /&gt;
Do you know who you are in school, in the playground, at home, in church?&lt;br /&gt;
Are you confident in being yourself? Can you stand up for yourself and be different? Are you settling for less or can you do better? Are you fully reaching your goals, doing your best?&lt;br /&gt;
The book is an illustration of how children can easily settle for the comforts of home, friends, neighborhoods and school.&lt;br /&gt;
 out of fear they may fail to step out into the unknown&lt;br /&gt;
 out of ignorance they not fully realize the potential of their gifts, talents and abilities&lt;br /&gt;
 out of conformity they can just go with the crowd what everyone else is doing, dropping out of school just following the peers.&lt;br /&gt;
 Unless our children try new things, step out in faith, they can live without discovering their full potentials.&lt;br /&gt;
The book seeks to encourage the children to see themselves as God sees them, in His image, in His reflection.&lt;br /&gt;
Daring to be different, Stepping out into the unknown becomes an adventure, a discovery and not a paralyzing impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For parents;&lt;br /&gt;
This book is for parents to affirm their children when they stand in front of the mirror, what do they see? Shoombah the lion grows up with a wrong identity perception of who he is as a result of his environment. Our children are vulnerable to experience an identity misconception.&lt;br /&gt;
The book is to show our children to see beyond their circumstances, rise above low self esteem, and fear. Only then they can step forward, embrace and discover their destiny no matter how uncertain it may seem; declaring;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I NOW KNOW WHO I AM!&lt;/p&gt;" />
