  <title>God, as We Know Him and Shall Know Him - E.W Ettoh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is here to awaken, direct and redirect the innate desire in every human being to know the true God. Many people, including believing Christians do not know God as He is, but lower Him to the level of one who exists to meet their needs. Others perceive God as existing to punish bad people and reward the good. Still, others disregard God entirely and prohibit Him from being part of their day to day life. But how is God really like in nature, character and dealing with us? How does God want us to know Him? What is left to know about God? Is God relevant in our modern livelihood?
In this book, the author traces out the quality and quantity of Gods self-revelation to humanity through His Word, Nature and His dealings with us all. The author has summarised and contextualised many in-depth revelations. It is the authors hope that by reading this book, you will be empowered and drawn closer to your heavenly Father who loves you." />
