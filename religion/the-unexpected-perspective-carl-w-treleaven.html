  <title>The Unexpected Perspective - Carl W. Treleaven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many Christians continue to be skeptical about Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution by natural selection.  But imagine there were reasons that Christians would want to embrace Darwin in a bear hug, and Darwinism become Christianitys new best friend?  This seemingly preposterous idea is the heart of this book.  The author identifies five key reasons why Christians ought to love Darwin  what he said, and the implications of his ideas.  The author demonstrates why BOTH the Bible and conventional modern science can be correct at the same time; how BOTH reinforce fundamental Christian doctrine; and the surprising implications for Christians and non-Christians alike.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TWENTY CHILDREN WILL BE VACCINATED AGAINST POLIO BECAUSE OF YOUR PURCHASE OF THIS BOOK. For each book sold, the author will contribute $4 to the Rotary Foundation, to be matched with an $8 contribution from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Just 60 cents covers the cost of a vaccination for one child. Learn more about how Rotary and its partners are completing the job of eradicating polio worldwide at endpolio.org.&lt;/p&gt;" />
