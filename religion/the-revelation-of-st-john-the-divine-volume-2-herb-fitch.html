  <title>The Revelation of St. John the Divine - Volume 2 - Herb Fitch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the second book of two volumes which completes Herb Fitch&#39;s interpretation on The Revelation of St. John the Divine. It was transcribed word for word from the tapes of classes 14 through 25 of the Revelation Seminar he gave in 1970.
Over the centuries, John&#39;s Revelation was in plain sight, yet, not understood, and the reason is because only the Christ Mind in man can reveal the Truth of Being. Not until the year 1970, did a man (who also experienced the Mind which was in Christ Jesus), sit still in meditation over many months, until, at last, the entire message of the Revelation was revealed once again. That man was Herb Fitch.
For those of you who have learned to make that contact with Spirit within, this book will now take you further on the Spiritual path. This book will show you how to let that Spirit take over your life. In other words, it will help you to die out of humanhood and be a transparency for Christ; bringing to you an actual awareness of your own Christhood.
It is suggested that you find a quiet place and read only one chapter at a time, until Something calls to you from these pages. Then, put these writings down, and walk away, find a place and sit down to meditate on what has stirred you within. I can tell you with a certainty born of experience that you can walk in another Dimension, right here, and right now, a Kingdom, an inner Temple, not made with hands, incomprehensible to the human mind. It is the Dimension in which your Eternal Self walks. It is the Kingdom in which your Spiritual identity resides. It is an inner Presence, the Spirit, closer than breathing, nearer than hands and feet, and it must take over your entire living experience, both within and without. Only then will you be obeying the message, You must be born of the Spirit." />
