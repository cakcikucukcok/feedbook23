  <title>Why God - William J. Pardue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;WHY GOD&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an exploration of the concept of God and its relation to reality. It searches for evidence as to the existence or non-existence of God in a variety of disciplines. The principles inherent in consciousness, time, motion, space, and quantum physics produce interesting clues in the search for God. A critical look at rational thought as practiced by mankind provides evidence of our limited ability to objectively define the parameters of not only God but also the real world within which we exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book reaches out to those either deeply religious or only mildly curious as to what God really means now and the possibility that there may be a measure of truth to this enduring sense of a cosmic deity. It is a curious mans guide to exploring an old concept in a new way. If God exists, can he be contacted? What does he look like, and where can he be found? What does Satan say about the existence of God? A chapter is included for Satans rebuttal to the argument that God may, in fact, exist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
