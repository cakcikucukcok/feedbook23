  <title>What Our Dad Told Me . . . Before I Killed Him - Patrick Berlinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What Our Dad Told Me . . . Before I Killed Him is both a biography of my dad as well as an autobiography about myself, along with our immediate family, relatives, and many friends. It focuses on how our good, Christian, positive family went downhill from 1979 all the way through current times. It heavily involves a demon named Abaddon, who convinced our dad that he, Abaddon, was an angel who gave our dad a ministry of judging other people for the sins in their lives, including the judgment of death by praying for people&#39;s deaths, but then even killing many people himself with guns when God didn&#39;t kill them. And that ultimately meant our family, ourselves! But when our dad started to kill our mom, I ended up killing him. But then I was sent to prison for that, and so I also wrote about the legal system, being in prison for several years. I also followed all of that up with seeing our dad again, years later, delving and mulling about whether that was spiritual answers, or just mental problems of my own. So be it." />
