  <title>Sons &amp; Sonship - Dumi Nkomo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The concept of Sonship in the 21st Century writings and sermons normally takes the form of protg and protge. This is an important biblical principle where, a mantle can be passed from fathers to sons. It is however, unfortunate that today many have claimed to be fathers without adherence to the biblical concept and likewise many claim sonship without a proper understanding of what it really means to be a son. In Sons and Sonship, Mr. Nkomo helps to bring home the fact that God has a special purpose for you as a son sons of God. 
There is a mandate that God has raised you for. He is saying Son of Faith Arise and Shine carry out the mandate of your father. Every son needs to find their purpose because creation is waiting. For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God (Romans 8 vs. 19). This book will, I trust help you identify your purpose and sonship and bringing a revival in your life." />
