  <title>Blood Brothers - Sam Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Blood Brothers presents the essential background and vital facts of a wonderful Old Testament narrative. Its a vivid portrayal of the unlikely relationship between two men of royal blood: David and Jonathan. More than just an appealing Bible story, the account of their friendship is a rich source of spiritual truths meant to help us better understand our relationship with Christ. Blood Brothers will expand your spiritual vision to include some often overlooked scriptural principles which can allow you to experience a greater measure of the rewarding fullness of the Christian life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found Blood Brothers biblical, relevant, and interesting. I have read and preached on the story of David and Jonathan many times in fifty-four years of ministry, and all I can say is if I had had this book earlier, I would have taught on the subject more effectively. That tells me this writing will be a real help to pastors, teachers, and individuals. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sam Mason has been a pastor, evangelist, Bible teacher, gospel singer, and Christian broadcaster. Hes also a published author and songwriter. Sams love of God and His Word has been the foundation for all of these ventures, and his desire is to draw others into an intimate relationship with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
