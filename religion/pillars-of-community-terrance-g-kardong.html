  <title>Pillars Of Community - Terrance G. Kardong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remain in me, as I remain in you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jesus &#39; disciples are given this command in John&#39;s gospel, and it is a command that extends to every one of his followers, including us. We deepen this mutual indwelling &#39;we in Christ and Christ in us &#39;each Sunday through the word and at the tale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Abiding Word&lt;/i&gt;, Barbara Reid, OP, takes the Sunday experience to every day with accessible weekly meditations on the lectionary readings of year. This collection of articles, which includes Scripture readings for Sundays and solemnities followed by reflections, allows readers to meditate on the connection between the sacred text and their daily lives. Living with the word day by day invites us into a closer relationship with Christ, the God who became flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barbara Reid is known for her contributions to The Word, a widely read column in America magazine. &lt;i&gt;Abiding Word&lt;/i&gt;showcases some of her finest entries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Barbara Reid, OP, is a Dominican Sister of Grand Rapids, Michigan. She holds a PhD in biblical studies from The Catholic University of America in Washington DC and is professor of New Testament and vice president and academic dean at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago. Her most recent books are&lt;/i&gt;Taking Up the Cross: New Testament Interpretations Through Latina and Feminist Eyes &lt;i&gt;(Fortress Press, 2007), &lt;/i&gt;The Gospel According to Matthew &lt;i&gt;(Liturgical Press, 2005), &lt;/i&gt;Parables for Preachers &lt;i&gt;(3 volumes; Liturgical Press, 1999, 2000, 2001), &lt;/i&gt;Choosing the Better Part? Women in the Gospel of Luke&lt;i&gt; (Liturgical Press, 1996). She has led many of CTU&#39;s Israel Study Programs and Retreats. She is general editor for Wisdom Commentary Series (forthcoming from Liturgical Press).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
