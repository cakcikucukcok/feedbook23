  <title>Who&#39;ll Be in Heaven &amp; Who Won&#39;t? - Dwight Carlson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. John A. Huffman, a leading figure in evangelical circles, says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwight Carlson has courageously tackled some of the toughest questions about heaven/hell and who will and will not be savedOne cannot read this book and remain content to have easy answers to heavy, complex questions. Instead one is overwhelmed with Gods grace....Dont read [Wholl Be in Heaven and Who Wont] unless you are willing to think, have previously unquestioned presuppositions challenged and to consider that perhaps when the veil of mystery is lifted you discover a God more demanding in his righteousness and more mercifully generous in the scope of his salvation than you have previously considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author asserts that there is a significant body of crucial information about life after death that is not being communicated to the average person on the street. Apropos is John Sanderss statement: I have found that many laypeople have hopes for the unevangelized but do not know how to articulate and defend such hopes. Within evangelicalism, the wider hope is more popular in the pews than in the pulpits. In fact, it has been suggested that evangelical leaders have managed to keep a tight lid on this volatile topic.[i]&lt;/p&gt;
