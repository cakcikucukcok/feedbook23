China has already surpassed Britain as the world’s fourth-largest economy and is now well on its way to becoming the world’s largest market. In his book, the author explains that foreign companies are therefore flocking to get a foothold in China before the market really becomes well established. This summary offers an insight into how the Chinese do business and how to understand and work with them in order to succeed in business in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added-value of this summary:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Save time&lt;br&gt;• Understand key concepts&lt;br&gt;• Expand your knowledge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To learn more, read &quot;One Billion Customers&quot; and find out what you need to do in order to access the market in China and sell over a billion products.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
