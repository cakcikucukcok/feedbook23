      <meta name="description" content="Through the years women have made substantial progress when it comes to workplace equality; however, we still have a long way to go. Studies affirm women are now earning more college degrees and are climbing the corporate ladder in record numbers. Despite these statistics, the gender wage gap remains, and only a small amount of women are employed in executive levels across various industries. Why the disparity? Gender stereotypes, which are partly to blame, are slow to change. Although some leadership books have encouraged women to “act like a man,” that faulty logic and behavior won’t help women lead with respect and authenticity. Where can women get credible advice on how to genuinely lead without compromising their integrity? In Unlimited: Conquering the Myth of the Glass Ceiling, Dr. Cortney Baker explains the four challenges women encounter when climbing the corporate ladder, while providing practical solutions for each one. Based on her current research, she encourages women to lead in ways that gain trust while maintaining integrity and confidence." />
