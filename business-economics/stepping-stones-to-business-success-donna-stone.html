  <title>Stepping Stones to Business Success - Donna Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This clear and succinct business guide is both easy to read and jam-packed with relevant, useful, and practical tips arising from thirty years of experience helping business owners succeed in their businesses. While Donna is considered an expert in the bookkeeping industry, this book covers so much more, including business improvement, goals, planning, home-based businesses, networking, communication, personal development, processes, procedures, sales, marketing, social media, staff, staff recruitment, time management, work/life balance, and so much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna has ditched the fluff and theory surrounding business and just gets on with giving the reader tried-and-true ideas, suggestions, and tips they can implement in their business from day one. Welcomed by both business advisors, accountants and business owners, this book is the first in the Stepping Stones series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna Stones bright, heartfelt writing makes business seem like fun, but also conveys useful information that will remind anyone in business of the fundamentals that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make a profitable difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simon Sharwood, editor of &lt;i&gt;My Business Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insightful and focussed, but most importantly, its totally practical!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can be certain that Donna is speaking from absolute experience when&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;she dishes up these little gems that you can and should use right now in your business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Glenn Walford, author of the Shaking the Profit series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, practical how-to tips for the business world, presented in a very reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;friendly format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Colleen Tarrant, accountant&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donna has written a fantastic guide of tried and tested tips to success; you can sense the experience she has been through in each and every one of them. All businesses, no matter what stage they are at, would benefit from reading this book and keeping it close by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anita Plath, president of the Redland City Chamber of Commerce&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an absolute must read for anyone wanting to succeed in business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and enjoy life whilst doing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kay Danes, international bestselling author &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally! A business book that has it all. A business bible suitable for all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;levels of business owners and managers. &lt;/p&gt;
