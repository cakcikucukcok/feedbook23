  <title>Do-It-Yourself, Customizable Employee Handbook: Save Time and Money - Vanessa Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The average lawsuit settlement settlement is $165,000! It takes just one disgruntled employee or applicant to file a lawsuit against you.  It is crucial for companies (of all sizes) to reduce the risk of lawsuits by creating a legally compliant employee handbook.  The employee handbook is the most important communication tool between you and your employees.  It also helps supervisors and managers to manage the workforce.  A handbook tells employees what the company expects from them and what they can expect from the company, i.e.,  &quot;What are my working hours?&quot; &quot;Who do I complain to about my supervisor&#39;s sexual advances?&quot; &quot;Am I eligible for Holiday pay?&quot; &quot;What is the dress code?&quot; A well-written employee handbook will answer these questions and more.  It is always safer to rely on written procedures rather than common practices of the business or unwritten procedures." />
