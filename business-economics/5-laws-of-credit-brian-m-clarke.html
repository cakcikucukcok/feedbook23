John Maxwell, author of Thinking for a Change, says One of the reasons people dont achieve their dreams is that they desire to change their results without changing their thinking.  He also quotes billionaire entrepreneur Richard M. Devos who states, The only thing that stands between a man and what he wants from life is often merely the will to try it and the faith to believe that it is possible.
In the lands of my birth and rebirth, I learned to payback what I borrow and not to think narrow.  For every problem there is a solution and for every solution there is a problem!  The problems of debt and lacking access to Capital are common amongst millions of people worldwide.  This book guides the thinking and behavior of individuals in attaining the ultimate goal of Personal Credit and financial freedom.
