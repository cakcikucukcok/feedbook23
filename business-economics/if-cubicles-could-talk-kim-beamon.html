Doesnt she get it?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Most corporate professionals have heard, made, thought or heard other people think at least one of those comments about someone in the office. Or worse, some corporate professionals believe one of those comments could have been made, heard, or thought about them!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The point: perception is reality.
