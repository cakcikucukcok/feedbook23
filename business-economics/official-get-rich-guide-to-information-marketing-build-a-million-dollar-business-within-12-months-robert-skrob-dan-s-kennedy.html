  <title>Official Get Rich Guide to Information Marketing: Build a Million Dollar Business Within 12 Months - Robert Skrob, Dan S. Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The founders of the Information Marketing Association and 30 ultra-successful information marketers reveal carefully guarded information on building a highly profitable information marketing business. The 2nd edition offers new cases and success stories, new chapters on social networking and over 40 new ways to make money with information products. The indisputable gurus of the information marketing world have broken ranks. Formerly relegated to the information marketing industry&amp;#8217;s typical fare of high-priced audio CDs, manuals and courses, once carefully guarded information on building a highly profitable information marketing business has been released to the general public in book form. Most info-marketers are lone wolf, small, quiet operators, many with home-based businesses, most with zero or just a few employees, most working only part-time hours, and most netting seven-figure profits.  In other words, there is no reason any reader of this book can&amp;#8217;t do exactly the same thing in just a few short months. Readers create an entirely new business that gives them added income or replaces their current salary entirely. It just takes the information they already know and the simple nine-step formula in this unprecedented book. Time and again, this formula has been proven to work&amp;#151;to the point where most info-marketers have a million-dollar business in just a year.&lt;/div&gt;" />
