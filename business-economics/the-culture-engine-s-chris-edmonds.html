  <title>The Culture Engine - S. Chris Edmonds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;An organizational &quot;North Star,&quot; codifying valued behaviors for optimal performance&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Culture Engine&lt;/i&gt; shows leaders how to create a high performing, values aligned culture through the creation of an organizational constitution. With practical step-by-step guidance, readers learn how to define their organization&#39;s culture, delineate the behaviors that contribute to greater performance and greater engagement, and draft a document that codifies those behaviors into a constitution that guides behavior towards an ideal: a safe, inspiring workplace. The discussion focuses on people, including who should be involved at the outset and how to engage employees from start to finish, while examples of effective constitutions provide guidance toward drafting a document that can actualize an organization&#39;s potential.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Culture drives everything that happens in an organization day to day, including focus, priorities, and the treatment of employees and customers. A great culture drives great performance, and can help attract and retain great talent. But a great culture isn&#39;t something that evolves naturally. &lt;i&gt;The Culture Engine&lt;/i&gt; is a guide to strategically planning a culture by compiling the company&#39;s guiding principles and behaviors into an organizational constitution.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Decide which behaviors and attitudes are desired in the organization&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Secure leader commitment to planning, drafting, and implementing the document&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn the most effective way to socialize the draft statement and get everyone on board&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Model desired behaviors to boost employee engagement throughout the process&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Organizational culture is not an amorphous thing – it comes down from the top, inspired and exemplified by the leadership. It can steer a company up or down, keep it on mission or force it off-course. For an organization to fulfill its potential, the culture must be on-point, truly reflecting the heart of the company from leaders to team members across the company. &lt;i&gt;The Culture Engine&lt;/i&gt; helps leaders define the playing field, pushing performance to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;" />
