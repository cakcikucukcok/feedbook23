Nearly every day, were called on to solve conflict of interests. Quite often, we do it unconsciously and are surprised when it ends up deadlocked. Real pros know they achieve better results if they have knowledge and experience in negotiating. In Better Negotiating, author Jutta Portner demonstrates, with the help of many real-life case studies, how to negotiate more effectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

 prepare a NEGO in short time&lt;br&gt;
 structure the conversation to come to an agreement&lt;br&gt;
 be empathetic to convince your partners to cooperate&lt;br&gt;
 apply body language professionally&lt;br&gt;
 achieve long-lasting results that satisfy the needs of both sides.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
