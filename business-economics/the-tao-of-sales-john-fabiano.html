  <title>The Tao of Sales - John Fabiano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sales is not a battle, a war, or an athletic competition. Sales is a simple process with altruistic overtones and shading and needs not be complicated. In The Tao of Sales, author John Fabiano offers a unique and refreshing look at sales methods that are simple as well as elegant, emphasizing considerations and processes meant to strip away clichs and lead to a mutually successful and agreeable process for sales people and buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Different from traditional sales doctrine, Fabiano presents an eclectic conversation about effective methods for success in sales based on simplicity, questioning, ownership, ethics, and working smart. The Tao of Sales gives a plethora of how-to tips regarding a simple, organic sales process that is a collaboration between sales person and prospect rather than a competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabiano uses his personal experiences to underscore many of the methods, principles, and points. Because sales advice and training takes many forms, shapes, and colors, he encourages practitioners make educated choices and to apply what resonates from within. The Tao of Sales is geared for the novice, the beginner, those needing to make choices or changes, and those looking for a better way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for The Tao of Sales&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one who has toiled successfully on both sides of the office doorsales consulting and sales managementreading this book felt like a great affirmation of all of the best things Ive learned from my mentors over the decades, minus all the bad stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Cuccaro, Managing Director, Affairs to Remember Caterers Small Business Advisory Council Alum, Yelp! Past Chairman of the Board, Georgia Restaurant Association Advisory Board, Special Events Magazine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are good sales people born or are they nurtured and developed from observation, experience, training, curiosity, and imitation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question remains unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high achievers I met owned every piece of what they were doing to bring in the business. Basics, fundamentals, always won out and it was hard to get away from that. Those who had turned their sales process into a Zen like state were top performers. Those who knew the product and the competition backwards and forwards were top performers. Those who took the time to get to know their prospects inside and out were top performers. These were people who didnt compete with their clothes, grooming, and delivery. These were people who could deliver their presentations with their eyes closed, never having to look directly at the slide and who never read the slide, but talked from it. Simple fundamentals allowed them to be elegant with all they did.&lt;/p&gt;" />
