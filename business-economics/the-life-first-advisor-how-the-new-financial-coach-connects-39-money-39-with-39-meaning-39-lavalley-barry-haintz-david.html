  <title>The Life First Advisor: How the new financial coach connects &#39;money&#39; with &#39;meaning&#39; - LaValley Barry, Haintz David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The role that financial advisors play in the lives of their clients is undergoing a paradigm shift around the world. Aging populations, the impact of technology and the regulatory environment are changing what financial advisors do for clients. This evolution will affect what advisors charge for their services and how they provide value to the people they serve.&lt;br /&gt; American author Barry LaValley and Australian David Haintz have developed a roadmap for those advisors around the world who wish to move their practice to the future. The authors help readers redefine what financial advisors do and how to communicate their value.&lt;br /&gt; The approach Barry and David outline is called &amp;quot;Life First&amp;quot; because it changes the advisor&amp;#39;s focus to the life issues that will ultimately require sound financial and investment strategies.&lt;br /&gt; The authors believe that this &amp;#39;new&amp;#39; advisor will become more of a financial coach and help clients formulate their vision of the future.&lt;br /&gt; The book provides the reader with a comprehensive tool kit of best practices from top financial advisors around the world. &amp;nbsp;Client Communication, value proposition, discovery, aging issues and gender all are redefined and modernized for readers who wish to survive in the midst of industry and client change.&lt;br /&gt; This isn&amp;#39;t just another practice management book, but a template for a new approach to being a valued financial advisor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
