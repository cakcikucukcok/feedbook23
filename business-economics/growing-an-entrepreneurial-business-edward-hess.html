  <title>Growing an Entrepreneurial Business - Edward Hess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Growing an Entrepreneurial Business: Concepts and Cases&lt;/I&gt; is a textbook designed for courses that focus on managing small to medium sized enterprises.  It focuses on the major management challenges that successful start-ups encounter when leaders decide to grow and scale their businesses.  
The book is divided into two parts—text and cases—to provide professors with maximum flexibility in organizing their courses.  The thirty-five cases can be used in conjunction with the text, or independently. Twelve cases are written as narratives with multiple teaching points, but without a focus on a particular business decision; the remaining twenty-three cases were written around specific conundrums related to strategy, operations, finance, marketing, leadership, culture, human resources, organizational design, business model, and growth. Discussion questions are provided for each case.
The text portion of the book discusses key issues derived from the author&#39;s research and consulting, and is meant to complement the case method of teaching, raising issues for conversation.  In addition to the real-world knowledge that students will derive from the cases, readers will take away research-based templates and models that they can use in developing or consulting with small businesses." />
