  <title>Harpers Ferry Armory and the New Technology - Merritt Roe Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Focusing on the day-to-day operations of the U.S. armory at Harpers Ferry, Virginia, from 1798 to 1861, this book shows what the &quot;new technology&quot; of mechanized production meant in terms of organization, management, and worker morale. A local study of much more than local significance, it highlights the major problems of technical innovation and social adaptation in antebellum America.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Merritt Roe Smith describes how positions of authority at the armory were tied to a larger network of political and economic influence in the community; how these relationships, in turn, affected managerial behavior; and how local social conditions reinforced the reactions of decision makers. He also demonstrates how craft traditions and variant attitudes toward work vis-à-vis New England created an atmosphere in which the machine was held suspect and inventive activity was hampered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Of central importance is the author&#39;s analysis of the drastic differences between Harpers Ferry and its counterpart, the national armory at Springfield, Massachusetts, which played a pivotal role in the emergence of the new technology. The flow of technical information between the two armories, he shows, moved in one direction only— north to south. &quot;In the end,&quot; Smith concludes, &quot;the stamina of local culture is paramount in explaining why the Harpers Ferry armory never really flourished as a center of technological innovation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Pointing up the complexities of industrial change, this account of the Harpers Ferry experience challenges the commonly held view that Americans have always been eagerly receptive to new technological advances.&lt;/p&gt;" />
