  <title>E-Commerce Operations Management - Marc J Schniederjans, Qing Cao, Jason H Triche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This updated edition of the book blends in new e-commerce technologies.   Mobile commerce (M-commerce) and use of cloud computing are offering a new set of challenges and opportunities for those individuals who know what they are and how they are related to e-commerce.

It connects the basic operations management activities undertaken by every organization (e.g., inventory management, scheduling, etc.) and translates their application into issues and problems faced in the field of e-commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also provides current research findings, strategies, and practices that can help students in the field of operations management run and improve their e-commerce operations. It covers most of the basic operations management activities and functions and  has been designed for an upper-level undergraduate business, a graduate business or engineering management course on e-commerce operations management for university students. Students interested in e-commerce operations will find this book a valuable guide to the important aspects of starting up and running an e-commerce operation.
