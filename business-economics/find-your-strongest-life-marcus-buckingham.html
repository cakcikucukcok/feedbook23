  <title>Find Your Strongest Life - Marcus Buckingham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Read &lt;I&gt;Find Your Strongest Life&lt;/I&gt; and discover:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;How to make the most of the role you were born to play&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;How to get others to understand who you really are&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;The successful strategies of other women like you&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;P&gt;Check out what women are already saying about &lt;I&gt;Find Your Strongest Life&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Brooke:&lt;/B&gt; When I read the “Ten Myths” that opened the book, I was completely hooked. The statistics are interesting and fresh. I also related to the problem that sets up the book: &quot;Which parts of me should I cut out?&quot; As I read, I could see myself in the Marcus’s big-picture analysis and statistics. The early part of the book made me anticipate a breakthrough. And Marcus delivered. Overall, he explains a woman&#39;s dilemma perfectly . . . in fresh terms with a unique spin. The main ideas in each chapter were so engaging. Chapter 6 in particular is worth the price of the book. I have already started looking for strong moments in my life, and I want to tell every woman I know to do the same.&amp;nbsp;It is definitely life-changing.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Rebecca:&lt;/B&gt;&amp;nbsp;It was really good. It was awesome. And to be honest, perfect timing for my life. I&#39;m REALLY in that place. I can&#39;t tell you how badly I&#39;ve been depressed for the last several months just trying to figure out what to do differently so I&#39;m not so miserable. On one hand, I&#39;m grateful I have a job still. I have a mortgage and bills and all that. But on the other hand...I can&#39;t continue to work at a job that gets me nowhere, is not rewarding, not challenging, and mentally drains me. I really have started avoiding my family because I&#39;ve become so rude and snippy. It&#39;s a bad cycle. BUT...God willing this year (sooner than later) I will be able to put this behind me and do what I love :) Even if it&#39;s making half as much money. Thanks for thinking of me to read this. I needed it!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Delaney:&lt;/B&gt; I was on a plane as I finished reading the manuscript. I was going to be with my daughter who is a law student. As I finished the pages, Marcus helped me gain a new understanding of myself that stood out like a neon sign: I am the person who helps others build infrastructure, get through situations ,and set everything right.&amp;nbsp; It goes beyond motherhood. I am an event planner by birth. I see big pictures and the components necessary to get from vision to execution.&amp;nbsp; The content helped me to reframe my own thinking. Very helpful. I’m excited to take the online test and see which&amp;nbsp;role I&#39;m born to play.&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Jennifer:&lt;/B&gt; As a working mother, I found the&amp;nbsp;concept of the book fascinating.&amp;nbsp; There are daily struggles of trying&amp;nbsp;to balance&amp;nbsp;being the perfect wife, mother, and employee, and the book helped me truly understand how to navigate all those demands.&lt;/P&gt;" />
