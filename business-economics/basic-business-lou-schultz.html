  <title>Basic  Business - Lou Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Enlightened leadership, innovative strategy, continued improvement of work processes, creative marketing, and sustaining culture are critical factors in the ability to adapt and succeed for today&amp;rsquo;s small organizations. Basic Business will help small-business people embrace these techniques for success at their own pace. Reading this book and trying the tools and techniques a step at a time will lead to long-term continued performance improvement and success. &amp;nbsp;This book contains a selection of popular newspaper articles by the author previously printed in Park Rapids Enterprise. The articles, or mini-chapters, are grouped into five parts: Leadership, Strategy, Process, Marketing, and Culture. The mini-chapter concept offers &amp;ldquo;bite-sized chunks&amp;rdquo; to make it more practical for the time-strapped small-business person. &amp;nbsp;The over 17,000,000 US businesses with under 100 employees can use Basic Business to their benefit. Their processes may be different, but the tools and techniques for improvement are the same. &amp;nbsp;Thirty years of consulting with many of the largest and best companies around the world revealed that long-term performance improvement is based on process improvement augmented with enlightened leadership.&lt;/p&gt;" />
