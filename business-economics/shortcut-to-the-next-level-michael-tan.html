  <title>Shortcut to the Next Level - Michael Tan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You might think that you need a formal education to learn anything worth knowingor perhaps you think a high school education is enough to get by.
The truth is that learning is a lifelong process, and you dont need to go to college to find out things that will make big differences in your life. Too many people, however, hit a ceiling early on in life and stop trying to improve themselves.
Michael Tan encourages you to look at life with a new mindset in this guidebook to lifelong learning. Youll learn how to:
 identify and work through four stages of the learning process;
 listen to others with an open mind;
 gain more satisfaction out of daily work; and
 harness the power of positive thinking.
Youll also learn how to bolster your chances of success by working with mentors. Be sure to pick these people carefully: They should define themselves (and not be defined by others), focus on results, and rarely get angry.
Tune out the noise thats preventing you from achieving great things by applying the simple tactics that will help you take a Shortcut to the Next Level." />
