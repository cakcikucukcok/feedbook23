  <title>&quot;The Law,&quot; &quot;The State,&quot; and Other Political Writings, 1843-1850 - Frederic Bastiat, Jacques de Guenin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric  Bastiat was a keen observer and analyst of political and economic  problems and a passionate proponent of liberal economic theory. &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Law,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;The State,&amp;rdquo; and Other Political Writings (1843&amp;ndash;1850),&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; collects nineteen of Bastiat&#39;s &amp;quot;pamphlets,&amp;quot; or articles, ranging from  the theory of value and rent, public choice and collective action,  government intervention and regulation, the balance of trade, education,  and trade unions to price controls, capital and growth, and taxation.  Many of these are topics still relevant and debated today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bastiat&#39;s famous essay &amp;quot;&lt;I&gt;The Law&amp;quot; &lt;/I&gt;showcases  his talents as an activist for the free market. He explains that the  law, far from being what it ought to be, &amp;quot;namely the instrument that  enabled the state to protect individuals&#39; rights and property, had  become the means for what he termed &#39;spoliation,&#39; or plunder.&amp;quot; From the  article &lt;I&gt;&amp;quot;The State,&amp;quot;&lt;/I&gt; in  which Bastiat argues against socialism, comes perhaps his  best-remembered quotation: &amp;quot;The state is the great fiction by which  everyone endeavors to live at the expense of everyone else.&amp;quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Throughout his articles,  Bastiat demonstrates how the combination of careful logic, consistency  of principle, and clarity of exposition is the instrument for solving  most economic and social problems. Readers will find extensive  introductory material, including notes on the translation and on the  editions of the&lt;I&gt; OEuvres Compl&amp;egrave;tes&lt;/I&gt;,  a chronology of Bastiat&amp;rsquo;s life and works, two maps of France showing  the cities associated with Bastiat, annotations to the articles, and a  bibliography. A special section provides little-known anecdotes about  Bastiat and his contemporaries, including his editor Prosper Paillottet,  who became Bastiat&amp;rsquo;s friend and eventually his executor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In  addition, this edition also contains footnotes and glossary entries  that help explain the political, economic, and intellectual context in  which Bastiat lived and worked. Filling gaps on Bastiat and his  philosophy, this volume features articles that have never before been  translated in English.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Bastiat &lt;/B&gt;(1801&amp;ndash;1850) was one of the leading advocates of free markets and free trade in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jacques de Guenin &lt;/B&gt;is  founder of the Cercle Fr&amp;eacute;d&amp;eacute;ric Bastiat.
