  <title>Changing Patterns - Judith Barrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In May 1950, Britain is struggling with the hardships of rationing and the aftermath of the SecondWorldWar. Peter Schormann, a German ex-prisoner of war, has left his home country to be with Mary Howarth, matron of a small hospital in Wales. The two met when Mary was a nurse at the POW camp hospital. They intend to marry, but the memory of Frank Shuttleworth, an ex-boyfriend of Mary&#39;s, continues to haunt them and there are many obstacles in the way of their happiness, not the least of which is Mary&#39;s troubled family. When tragedy strikes, Mary hopes it will unite her siblings, but it is only when a child disappears that the whole family pulls together to save one of their own from a common enemy.In May 1950, Britain is struggling with the hardships of rationing and the aftermath of the SecondWorldWar.
