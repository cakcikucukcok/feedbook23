      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the lastest book from the craniums of&amp;nbsp;US Small Business Administration Entrepreneur of the Year, business coach Clay Clark, and serial entrepreneur and business owner Dr. Robert Zoellner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOOM: The 13 Steps to Business Success from a Business Coach&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is one of the most practical and succinct books to learn the proven systems needed to grow a successful business. Loaded with real business cases studies from business owners like you, depictions of real world business scenarios, and truth cannon notable quotables will have you turning page after page. This book has been designed to teach you the systems that will allow you to work ON the business, not just IN it. You will be able to MANAGE strategy, and delegate execution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Authors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am writing this book because Dr. Zoellner and I want to teach YOU how to start and grow a sustainably successful business so that YOU can create both the financial and time freedom YOU need to enjoy YOUR life as you see fit. The only reason a business exists is to serve YOU and provide YOU with the funds to pursue YOUR F6 goals: If you had all of the money in the world, what would you spend your time doing?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We both grew up poor and between Doctor Zoellner and I, we have built (in no particular order) America&amp;rsquo;s largest wedding entertainment company (www. DJConnection.com), two booming optometry clinics (www.DRZoellner.com), one of the most successful men&amp;rsquo;s grooming (haircut) businesses in Oklahoma (www. EITRLounge.com), one of the largest auto auctions in the mid-west (Z66AA.com), the most successful PR and Marketing Firm in Oklahoma (www.MakeYourLifeEpic. com), a thriving durable medical company called A to Z Medical (www. AToZMedicaltulsa.com), the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest award-winning wedding photography company (www.EpicPhotos.com), a bank (that Doctor Zoellner invested heavily in...www.BankRegent.com), a thriving online school (www.Thrive15.com), a regional radio show (www.ThriveTimeShow.com), and a 200 acre championship horse-breeding ranch (www.rockinzranchok.com). Building a successful business is not infinitely complicated, you just have to start by solving a problem that people legitimately have and that you can solve at a profit. Entrepreneurship is not about &amp;ldquo;going viral&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;being disruptive in the marketplace,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;success secrets&amp;rdquo; and all of the crap that you will learn if you earn an MBA, invest every waking hour into watching TED Talks, or spend your hard-earned money paying Tai Lopez or the countless other online charlatans who promise your instant success. By the way, Tai Lopez&amp;rsquo;s office is located at the following address: Office 3, Unit R, Penfold Works Trading Estate Imperial Way, Watford, Herts, WD24 4YY. Do a search for his building using Google Maps. It&amp;rsquo;s fascinating. Thrive15.com is located at 1100 Riverwalk Terrace #100 Jenks, OK 74037.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
