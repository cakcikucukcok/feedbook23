  <title>Prisonomics - Vicky Pryce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;In March 2013, Vicky Pryce was sentenced to eight months in prison for accepting her ex-husband&amp;amp;#8217;s penalty points on her driving licence some ten years earlier. After a very public trial, she was sent first to the notorious Holloway and then to East Sutton Park, an open prison in Kent. Inside, she kept a diary documenting her views and experiences; from this diary, Prisonomics was born. Faced with the realities of life behind bars and inspired by the stories of the women she met, Pryce began to research the injustices she found within the prison system. In this informed and important critique, she draws upon her years of experience in economics to call for radical reform and seeks to change how we look at crime and punishment. Prisonomics is not only a personal account of Pryce&amp;amp;#8217;s experience in prison. It is also a compelling analysis of both the economic and the very human cost of keeping women behind bars.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
