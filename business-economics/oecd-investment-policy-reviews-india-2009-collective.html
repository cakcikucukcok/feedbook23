  <title>OECD Investment Policy Reviews: India 2009 - Collective</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This review of India&#39;s investment policy finds that India has made tremendous progress in building a policy environment to encourage investment. As a result, the country’s economy is growing more rapidly and FDI inflows have accelerated impressively. However, investment remains insufficient to meet India’s needs, particularly in infrastructure. Current efforts to strengthen and liberalise the regulatory framework for investment need to be intensified. India’s well-developed economic legislation should be implemented at an accelerated pace both at national level and right across India’s States and Union Territories. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OECD Investment Policy Reviews: India &lt;/em&gt;charts India&#39;s progress in developing an effective policy framework to promote investment for development, especially since the acceleration of economic reform from 1991 onward. It focuses on policies towards investment, trade, competition and other elements of the business environment. Finally, it outlines some of the challenges of implementing national-level reforms at state level.&lt;/p&gt;" />
