  <title>Summary: BuzzMarketing - Mark Hugues - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “BUZZMARKETING: Get People To Talk&lt;br&gt;About Your Stuff” by Mark Hughes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mark Hughes is the founder and CEO of his own marketing consulting firm, Buzzmarketing, Inc. He was formerly vice president of marketing for Half.com and a marketing executive at PepsiCo, Pep Boys (where he managed a $42 million annual marketing budget) and American Mobile Satellite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In BuzzMarketing, Hughes explains that there’s just so much background noise and clutter now that traditional advertising isn’t as effective as it once was. In 2004 alone, American companies spent over $235 billion on marketing – more than the entire GDP of Mexico. To add to the problem, technology now makes it easy for consumers to zap commercials and block intrusive ads. It isn’t feasible to market the traditional way anymore.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the author, you can generate better results using media attention and word-of-mouth endorsements. Buzzmarketing is all about capturing the attention of consumers and the media by making your brand or your company entertaining, fascinating or newsworthy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discover the key buzzmarketing principles and you will see more and more people talking about your company and your products!" />
