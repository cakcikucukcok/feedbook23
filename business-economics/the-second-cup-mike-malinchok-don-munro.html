      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to The Second Cup, a collection of daily coaching messages designed to stimulate your thoughts, engage your emotions and serve as a catalyst to help you manifest your best leadership qualities each and every day.   The collection of messages in this book comes from my weekly coaching newsletter, of the same nameWhen selecting the messages for this book from the library of newsletter editions, I used three criteria to make my choices: 1. Each message in this book has generated a number of personal responses that represents at least 30% of the subscriber base at the time of publishing,which told me that the specific message is timely and resonates. 2. Each message has generated at least one personal response that indicated a significant shift in a personal performance, resulting in tangible benefits, which told me that the content is relevant and applicable. 3. Each message has a deep personal connection to me that I felt compelled to share because it brought about some type of a shift in me, which confirms that the content is personal, not just theoretical.The 31 messages are arranged to provide you with the flexibility to either consume the content sequentially or approach each reading based on a topic that supports a situation you may be facing on a given day.&lt;br&gt;" />
