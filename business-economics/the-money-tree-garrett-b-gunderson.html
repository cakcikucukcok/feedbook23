  <title>The Money Tree - Garrett B. Gunderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is not a book about money; it&#39;s about contribution, about human greatness, and about true prosperity beyond money. It&#39;s for people who see greater purpose in being wealthy than personal comfort, status, prestige, and an irresponsible sense of freedom. Furthermore, this book will help you to get rid of scarcity in your life through increased awareness and ways to overcome the destructive mode of scarcity and ultimately to cultivate a paradigm of abundance. Most financial teachings today originate from a paradigm of scarcity. With such a root, it&#39;s no wonder that the fruits of such teachings are limited at best and destructive at worst. No matter how good the intention, the advice and action based primarily on the scarcity paradigm can never lead to the results that we all want financially. We&#39;ll uncover the truth about retirement planning, outline the proper philosophies and principles that true wealth is based on, and help you to practically apply those fundamentals utilizing appropriate products and strategies." />
