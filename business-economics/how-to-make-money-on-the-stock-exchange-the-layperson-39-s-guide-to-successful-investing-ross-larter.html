  <title>How to Make Money on the Stock Exchange: The layperson&#39;s guide to successful investing - Ross Larter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case.&#39; - Robert G. Allen, investment advisor and author of Multiple Streams of Income  In many people&#39;s thinking, the financial markets are reserved only for the wealthy or people with financial or economic backgrounds.  They discard the idea of becoming involved in trading because they perceive it to be too difficult.  But Ross Larter, author of How to Make Money on the Stock Exchange, believes that the markets provide opportunities for everyone to generate income.  Learning the skills of trading on the stock market can provide you with the opportunity to generate an income well into your retirement years. To those who have walked the journey for a while, the stock market becomes like an all-you-can-eat buffet, providing opportunity on a daily basis for individuals to make money for themselves and their families.  How to Make Money on the Stock Exchange is written for ordinary people, in everyday language, to help them understand how the stock market works, and how to use this knowledge to acquire the necessary skills to generate a secondary (and potentially a primary) income by investing and/or trading on the markets. You don&#39;t need to be a financial whizz-kid to make money on the stock market. All you have to do is be willing, and take the time, to learn about it. This book will show you how." />
