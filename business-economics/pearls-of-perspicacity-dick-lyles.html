  <title>Pearls of Perspicacity - Dick Lyles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pearls of Perspicacity more resembles a box of chocolates than it does a traditional business or career book. Each chapter delivers its unique tidbit of knowledge and insight in a manner best suited to the ideas presented. The chapters differ in length, tone, and depth, but all have one characteristic in common: They all present nuggets of insight to help you immediately achieve better performance and greater fulfillment in your life.
Why &quot;perspicacity&quot; you ask? Why couldn&#39;t you just say &quot;pearls of wisdom&quot;? Or even something more straightforward like &quot;good ideas&quot;? The answer is simple. None of those words sufficiently describe the book&#39;s broad range of content and the true nature of the ideas presented. Take wisdom for example. Wisdom implies a soundness based on knowledge, experience, or understanding that leads to good judgment. Fair enough; the ideas in the book would pass this test. But the nature of these pearls extends beyond mere soundness. Perspicacity implies a special keenness or acuity applied to insight. It implies a cleverness, perceptiveness, or acuity that takes the basic notion of wisdom one step deeper. This deeper level internalization of certain truths will give you a noticeable advantage in your career." />
