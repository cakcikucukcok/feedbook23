  <title>Failing Forward - John C. Maxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Are some people born to achieve anything they want while others struggle? Call them lucky, blessed, or possessors of the Midas touch. What is the real reason for their success? Is it family background, wealth, greater opportunities, high morals, an easy childhood?&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; best-selling author John C. Maxwell has the answer: The difference between average people and achieving people is their perception of and response to failure.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Most people are never prepared to deal with failure. Maxwell says that if you are like him, coming out of school, you feared it, misunderstood it, and ran away from it. But Maxwell has learned to make failure his friend, and he can teach you to do the same.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;I want to help you learn how to confidently look the prospect of failure in the eye and move forward anyway,&quot; says Maxwell. &quot;Because in life, the question is not &lt;I&gt;if&lt;/I&gt; you will have problems, but how you are going to deal with them. Stop failing backward and start &lt;I&gt;failing forward&lt;/I&gt;!&quot;&lt;/P&gt;" />
