  <title>The China Factor - Amy Karam, Ken Wilcox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Innovation of Globalization – proven strategies to succeed and out-compete emerging competition&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Does your company know how to compete effectively in the evolving global business arena? What tactics must your company use to overcome price discounting wars that cut into your margins? What are the strategies your new rivals incorporate that may prove more valuable to customers than the superior products you offer?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The China Factor&lt;/i&gt; equips Western businesses with a practical framework for competing successfully in today’s ever-changing global markets. Written by an expert in competitive strategy and global market expansion, this book is packed with insights gained through first-hand experience leading competitive programs at a high-tech multinational corporation and extensive research. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When it comes to globalization, the rules have changed—what was once nice-to-know is now need-to-know, and this book lays it out in a clear, no-nonsense style. Based on cases with over 50 countries, you will learn why a premium product, though domestically successful, may not be well received in foreign markets. You’ll also discover the critical factors that contribute to success in both emerging and established markets. Disruptive competitors are transformed from threats to examples as you learn to recognize opportunities for re-evaluation, and shift your strategy to stay ahead of the curve.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The economic rise of China and other new entrants is challenging Western companies in new ways. This book explains why, and provides actionable strategies for success in any market.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Grow and maintain an Innovation Advantage using 5 models&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn from disruptors how to win your emerging markets customers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Understand the power of politics in business&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop a deeper Culture IQ to expand your customer base&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Use a 5-part Strategic Framework to formulate new sales tactics&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’re already well-aware of the global threat to Western business, and endless analysis only goes so far toward a solution. You need to know how to respond, survive, and thrive, and just how to regain the competitive edge. The truth is that Western companies must change they way they do business, and push innovation beyond the product and into every aspect of every operation – they need to be innovative in how they do business abroad. &lt;i&gt;The China Factor&lt;/i&gt; provides a clear action plan, and case studies from global leaders like Cisco, Xiaomi, and Apple with insightful strategies for changing and winning the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Endorsements&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;The China Factor&lt;/i&gt; is right on the mark. It addresses a real need, one that very few others are tackling—the action that US and other Western-based companies can take in response to the China challenge. Global competitiveness is a huge problem for the West and companies are ill-prepared.&lt;i&gt;The China Factor&lt;/i&gt; goes beyond what other books do, providing an important, insightful, and practical prescription on how companies can shift their strategy…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;— Ken Wilcox, former CEO and chairman, current Chairman Emeritus, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silicon Valley Bank&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;The China Factor&lt;/i&gt;’s case studies and practical resources make this book a must-read for any corporation that wants to win globally, particularly as innovation is being redefined.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;—SIMON KHALAF, SVP, Yahoo Inc.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;The China Factor&lt;/i&gt; provides a new strategic framework and an essential set of marketing guidelines for Western companies that have to compete or partner with Chinese firms in OECD countries, China or emerging market countries.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;—DR.
