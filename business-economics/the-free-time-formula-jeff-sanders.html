  <title>The Free-Time Formula - Jeff Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Find the time, clarity, and mental space to achieve your goals&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Free-Time Formula&lt;/i&gt; helps you slow down time and get the important things done. We&#39;re all overworked, stressed, and always being asked to do more, and do it better; the days aren&#39;t getting any longer, so something has to give—don&#39;t let it be your sanity. This book provides a real-world framework for more effective time management that helps you prioritize, focus, clarify, and go. You&#39;ll begin with a time audit to assess your current stress, strategies, and output—and the results may shock you. From there, you&#39;ll work step-by-step toward a new daily routine that will help you become the focused, efficient achiever you&#39;ve been trying to be for so long. It&#39;s not about cramming more into your precious 24 hours, it&#39;s about figuring out what really matters &lt;i&gt;to you&lt;/i&gt;, and getting the most important things done first. Every day. Never miss another big deadline, never flake on an important meeting, never be late to an appointment again. It is possible with great planning, and this book is your personal guide. &lt;p&gt;Focused on action, not filler, this book is an excellent resource for those who want to achieve more, but do less. With a few simple changes, you&#39;ll find the time you&#39;ve been missing and put it to more productive use. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Define and prioritize your personal and professional goals and responsibilities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Cut the distractions and clarify your daily objectives&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Adapt your workplace tools and environment to facilitate actual work&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Periodically self-assess, course–correct when needed, and plan for the future&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than rush through another day leaving things un-done and roses un-sniffed, take a beat and a breath, and take back your day with &lt;i&gt;The Free-Time Formula&lt;/i&gt;." />
