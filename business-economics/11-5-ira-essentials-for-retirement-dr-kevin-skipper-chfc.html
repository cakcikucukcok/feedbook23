  <title>11.5 Ira Essentials for Retirement - Dr. Kevin Skipper ChFC</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you have an IRA, 401k, or other retirement plan, this book is important for you to read. It is likely that you have heard about how to invest your IRA, but what happens to the IRA in the future when you pass or your spouse passes? This book lays out the journey and strategies of what happens to the IRA and the tax strategies on how to keep the most of your IRA from the IRS. 
Pre-Retirement: If you are five years or less from retirement, this book helps you understand the decisions that you will face in the future. It will give you the road map that you would need to follow with your IRA. 
Retiree: If you have already rolled your retirement plan to an IRA, this book can serve as a checkup. Did you make the right moves? Are you working with the right IRA advisor? Do you have your beneficiaries in place? Are there ways that you can improve the investment, safety, and structure of your IRA today and when you are gone?" />
