      <meta name="description" content="The New Global Business model (NEWGIBM) book describes the background, theory references, case studies, results and learning imparted by the NEWGIBM project, which is supported by ICT, to a research group during the period from 2005-2011. The book is a result of the efforts and the collaborative work between SMEs, consultancies and researchers across various lines of business, competences and research domains. The book commences with a theoretical discussion of the business model and its innovation literature and explains how this was a collaborative study by researchers from three Danish Universities. The book continues by describing, analyzing and showing how NEWGIBM was implemented in SMEs in different industrial companies/networks. Based on this effort, the researchers try to describe and analyze the current context, experience of NEWGIBM and finally the emerging scenarios of NEWGIBM." />
