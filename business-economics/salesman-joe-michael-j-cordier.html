  <title>Salesman Joe - Michael J. Cordier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; The samurai warrior hones his skill to the point of perfection. If he does not, the consequences are dire. It is a matter of life and death. In most cases, the sales professional faces a similar battle with the same consequences - not only for survival, but for prosperity. Therefore it makes sense to understand the mind-set and modus operandi of the warrior to be successful in sales. Actions that must be done when faced with an adversary:&lt;br&gt;
	The preparation&lt;br&gt;
	How to engage the &#39;enemy&#39;&lt;br&gt;
	Choosing the correct weapons&lt;br&gt;
	Closing the deal (kill)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps more important is the way in which the warrior (and the sales professional) executes the task:&lt;br&gt;
	Our code of ethics&lt;br&gt;
	The responsibility of being an expert&lt;br&gt;
	Finding the &#39;middle way&#39;&lt;br&gt;
	Operate in harmony
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Part II of Salesman Joe challenges the status quo in the sales environment as it is practiced today. The pitfalls of entrepreneurship are discussed as well as the role of senior management. Titles, women in sales, and sales training are placed under the magnifying glass. The age old issue of sales and marketing (horse/cart, chicken/egg) is revised. Ultimately, becoming your own best friend is the sales professional&#39;s biggest challenge. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;The business world of today, through examples like the Enron scenario, has surely shown that &quot;Situation Ethics&quot; is the standard.  Salesman Joe is a counter-culture writing that will not only reinforce the aspects of approaching your profession with solid ethics, but it will reflect on the blessings and rewards that come from that very same approach&quot;.
