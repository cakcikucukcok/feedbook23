  <title>Fairness Is Overrated - Tim Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt; &lt;P&gt;Discover the tools of leadership to revolutionize your workplace.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;P&gt;Tim Stevens traveled an alternative road—leaving high school and immediately joining a national non-profit organization. He rose quickly through the ranks of leadership, but nine years later left it all behind to help an upstart church get its footing. During the 20 years Stevens served as Executive Pastor at Granger Community Church near South Bend, Indiana, the ministry grew from a congregation of 300 to more than 5,000; from a staff of five to more than 130; with a preschool, restaurant, three campuses and more than 1,800 new churches planted in southern India. &lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Leaders learn by leading. Stevens knows that creating a healthy and successful organization requires throwing out the conventional instruction manual and writing one that balances practical lessons, spiritual truths, and twenty-first century realities—exactly what you will find in &lt;I&gt;Fairness Is Overrated&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Stevens, now an executive with the Vanderbloemen Search Group, takes his lifetime of service and dispenses with conventional wisdom. Short, powerful chapters end with actionable discussion questions. Four pillars hold up every successful leader: Be a person of integrity. Identify the right people around you. Build a great culture. Lead through crisis.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;This is a manual of doing, not talking. No fluff, no stale inspirational platitudes. It’s time to move past planning and kick-start Monday into action. &lt;/P&gt;" />
