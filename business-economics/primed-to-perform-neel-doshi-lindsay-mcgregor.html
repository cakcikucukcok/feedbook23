While most leaders believe culture is critical to success, few know how to build one, or sustain it over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if you knew the science behind the magic&amp;#8212;a science so predictive and powerful that you could transform your organization? What if you could use cutting edge psychology to unlock people&amp;#8217;s innate desire to innovate, experiment, and adapt? In &lt;em&gt;Primed to Perform,&lt;/em&gt; Neel Doshi and Lindsay McGregor show you how to do just that. The result: higher sales, more loyal customers, and more passionate employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Primed to Perform&lt;/em&gt; explains the counter-intuitive science behind great cultures, building on over a century of academic thinking.

It explores the authors&amp;#8217; original research into how Total Motivation leads to higher performance in iconic companies, from Apple to Starbucks to Southwest Airlines. Most importantly, it teaches you to build great cultures, using a systematic and sustainable approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High performing cultures cant be left to chance.
