      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;A STAKE IN THE OUTCOME: Building a Culture of Ownership for the Long-Term Success of Your Business&quot; by Jack Stack and Bo Burlingham&lt;br&gt; Jack Stack is president and CEO of SRC Holdings Corporation (formerly Springfield ReManufacturing Corporation), an employee owned company since 1982. Bo Burlingham is editor-at-large of Inc. Magazine. &lt;br&gt;According to Stack and Burlingham, &quot;to succeed in creating an employee-owned and operated company, employees have to be taught how to think and act like owners&quot;. A Stake in the Outcome advises business managers to go beyond the traditional ways of rewarding employees, and teaches them how to build a sustainable ownership culture which provides employees with the right tools and attitude to carry out their responsibilities with the goals of the wider company at heart. &lt;br&gt;This guide outlines 14 Rules of Employee Ownership, and systematically addresses each point often illustrated with examples. At the end of this summary you should have a clearer understanding of how to empower your employees with the trust and intelligence they need in order to act in the company’s best interests, without necessarily handing out company shares." />
