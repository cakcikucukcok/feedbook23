  <title>Black Mail - Bill Daly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Murder and drug-dealing are all in a day&#39;s work for DCI Charlie Anderson, but everything&#39;s on a different scale now that psychopath Billy McAteer is back on the streets of Glasgow. Simon Ramsay, a successful and seemingly respectable businessman, receives an email with a photograph attached. If he doesn&#39;t come up with £50k, the sender will release it to the press, and Ramsay&#39;s career will be over. In a state of panic he contacts his mistress, Laura. He tells her a blackmailer has managed to get his hands on a compromising photo of them in bed together. Terrified of what her violent husband will do if he finds out about her affair, Laura enlists the services of McAteer to deal with the blackmailer. It is a moment of madness, with disastrous consequences. And it falls to DCI Anderson and his sidekick to unravel the trail of death and destruction. &#39;Daly effortlessly incorporates the seedy underbelly of the city… Black Mail can proudly sit alongside books by far more established writers in the Glasgow noir field… A highly enjoyable debut&#39; - crimefictionlover.co.uk (*****FIVE-STAR REVIEW*****) &#39;Impressive ... a vivid new voice in Tartan noir&#39; - MAGGIE CRAIG &#39;Everything you would want in a crime novel -- a gritty gutsy Glasgow as the setting, realistic coppers, dodgy businessmen, out and out villains and enough twists and turns to tie you up and hang you over a precipice of suspense. Bring on the next in the series!&#39; - lovereading.co.uk" />
