      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The must-read summary of Bill Gates&#39; book: &quot;Business @ the Speed of Thought:&amp;nbsp;Using a Digital Nervous System&quot;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This complete summary of the ideas from Bill Gates&#39; book &quot;Business @ the Speed of Thought&quot; shows that competitive business advantage in the 21st century will revolve around an organisation’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances rapidly. To achieve this, information needs to flow within the business enterprise efficiently. The best way to achieve this is by building a Digital Nervous System. A Digital Nervous System combines personal computer, internet and communication technologies. It will be the conceptual framework around which a better understanding of the challenges of the marketplace will be constructed – and from which the company’s response will be planned and implemented. This Digital Nervous System will mean companies can transfer information around the organisation so completely that business decisions at all levels of the organisation can be made as quickly as information becomes available. These organisations will be ideally suited to the demands and requirements of the evolving business environment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Added-value of this summary:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Save time&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Understand the key concepts&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;•&amp;nbsp;Increase your business knowledge&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To learn more, read &quot;Business&amp;nbsp;@ the Speed of Thought&quot; and discover an insight into the Digital Nervous System, the ‘‘killer application’’ of business in the 21st century.&lt;/b&gt;" />
