  <title>The Food Fighters - Alexander Justice Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Robert Egger wasnt impressed when his fiance dragged him out one night to help feed homeless men and women on the streets of Washington, DC. That was twenty-five years ago, and it wasnt that the cocky nightclub manager didnt want to help peoplehe just felt that the process was more meaningful to those serving the meals than those receiving them.

By teaming up with chefs, convicts, addicts, and other staffers seeking second chances, Egger has helped DCs homeless and hungry population trade drugs, crime, and dependency for culinary careersand fed thousands in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written by a DC Central Kitchen insider, &lt;em&gt;The Food Fighters &lt;/em&gt;shows how Eggers innovative approach to combating hunger and creating opportunity has changed lives and why the organization is more relevant today than ever before. This retrospective goes beyond the simplistic moralizing used to describe the work of many nonprofits by interviewing dozens of DC Central Kitchen leaders, staff , clients, and stakeholders from the past two-and-a-half decades. It captures the personal and organizational struggles of DC Central Kitchen, offering new insights about what doing good really means and what we expect of those who do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The women and men of DC Central Kitchen are in the business of changing lives. I have felt first-hand the energy and enthusiasm in that basement kitchen, and its infectious. This book is a testament to what is possible when we break down stereotypes, rethink old models, and challenge ourselves to become true agents of change.&lt;/p&gt;
