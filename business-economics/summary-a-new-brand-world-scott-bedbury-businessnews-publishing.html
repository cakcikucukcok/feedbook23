  <title>Summary: A New Brand World - Scott Bedbury - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;A NEW BRAND WORLD: 8 Principles for Achieving Brand Leadership in the 21st Century&quot; by Scott Bedbury.&lt;br&gt;Scott Bedbury is the CEO of Brandstream, a global brand development consulting practice. Before that, he was senior vice president of marketing at Starbucks, easily one of the most recognisable brands in the world.  A strong set of brand values can be a company’s most important asset. They allow a company to distinguish itself from competitors and to gain the trust and loyalty of its clients over a period of time. Bedbury talks about a brand being like a company’s conscience. It needs to be relevant, consistent and coherent. But more importantly, it needs to be cared for and brought to life by humans who care about its future and longevity.&lt;br&gt;This summary of A New Brand World outlines eight principles to creating a solid 21st century brand, giving useful and well-known industry examples to highlight the main points. An impressive amount of information has been condensed into this neat and digestible format, making it a great guide for anyone looking to build a memorable brand for the 21st century, whether you are building on existing foundations or starting entirely from scratch." />
