  <title>Competing Against Luck - Clayton M. Christensen, Taddy Hall, Karen Dillon, David S. Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The foremost authority on innovation and growth presents a path-breaking book every company needs to transform innovation from a game of chance to one in which they develop products and services customers not only want to buy, but are willing to pay premium prices for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do companies know how to grow? How can they create products that they are sure customers want to buy? Can innovation be more than a game of hit and miss? Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen has the answer. A generation ago, Christensen revolutionized business with his groundbreaking theory of disruptive innovation. Now, he goes further, offering powerful new insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After years of research, Christensen has come to one critical conclusion: our long held maxim&amp;#8212;that understanding the customer is the crux of innovation&amp;#8212;is wrong. Customers don&amp;#8217;t buy products or services; they &quot;hire&quot; them to do a job. Understanding customers does not drive innovation success, he argues. Understanding customer jobs does. The &quot;Jobs to Be Done&quot; approach can be seen in some of the world&amp;#8217;s most respected companies and fast-growing startups, including Amazon, Intuit, Uber, Airbnb, and Chobani yogurt, to name just a few. But this book is not about celebrating these successes&amp;#8212;it&amp;#8217;s about predicting new ones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Christensen contends that by understanding what causes customers to &quot;hire&quot; a product or service, any business can improve its innovation track record, creating products that customers not only want to hire, but that they&amp;#8217;ll pay premium prices to bring into their lives. Jobs theory offers new hope for growth to companies frustrated by their hit and miss efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book carefully lays down Christensen&amp;#8217;s provocative framework, providing a comprehensive explanation of the theory and why it is predictive, how to use it in the real world&amp;#8212;and, most importantly, how not to squander the insights it provides. &lt;/p&gt;" />
