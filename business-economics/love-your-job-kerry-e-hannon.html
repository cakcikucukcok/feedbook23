      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;AWARDS: Independent Publisher Book Award 2015 (Silver) and National Mature Media Award 2015 (Bronze)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Step-by-step tips for revitalizing your career&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, it &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; possible to have a job you love, and it doesn&#39;t require starting from scratch. &lt;i&gt;Love Your Job&lt;/i&gt; is a guide to making work fulfilling and fun — again, or even for the first time. Why count down the hours of the day or the days to retirement when you could reinvigorate your workday, transforming the daily doldrums into a daily dose of enjoyable activity? Kerry Hannon, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; columnist and AARP&#39;s Jobs Expert, focuses on the little things that can make a big difference in how we feel about work.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love Your Job&lt;/i&gt; is all about the routines, habits, and thought patterns that, over the years, may have turned a dream job into a drudge or, worse, a nightmare. Changing these habits and attitudes is simple, and this book shows you how to identify the little things that make work enjoyable and engaging. Using these simple techniques, you can adopt the attitude that will keep you happy and that might just lead to bigger and better things, no matter what stage of your career you are in. In this book, you will learn to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop new habits that bring more purpose into every single workday&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Rekindle your hope and motivation by celebrating small successes&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Recognize negative patterns that keep you from enjoying your job&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Craft an entrepreneurial attitude that will get you noticed and enrich your work life&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;We all deserve to experience happiness and satisfaction every day, at every stage of our careers. Kerry Hannon explains that you don&#39;t have to make a huge career transition to love work again. But if you reinvent the way you see work, who knows where your new outlook will lead? Wake up to the countless possibilities that await you with &lt;i&gt;Love Your Job&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
