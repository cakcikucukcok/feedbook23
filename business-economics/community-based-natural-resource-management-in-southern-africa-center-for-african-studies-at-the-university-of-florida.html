  <title>Community-Based Natural Resource Management in Southern Africa - Center for African Studies at the University of Florida</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is a compelling concept - if people are allowed to be custodians of their resources, better management of the resources will result. CBNRM is much more complex and challenging than has commonly been understood, but can provide a way to achieve a more equitable and sustainable approach to the use of natural resources. 
This book has a focus on Southern Africa. It is aimed at students of natural resource management including undergraduates, conservation practitioners, and development-sector implementing agents. It is theoretically grounded, but has a major applied focus with respect to understanding the why, what, and how of CBNRM in order to more effectively guide natural resource management. It is not a manual with explanatory details about implementation measures; rather, it helps the reader to understand the complexity of CBNRM, and provides a guide to other resources that will assist in enhancing learning. 
Part I consists of ten chapters. After introducing the CBNRM concept, consideration is given to the following: History as a Determinant of Progress; Economic Foundations; Well-Being, Livelihoods and Business; Institutions and Governance; Stakeholder Analysis; Adaptive Management; Capacity Development and Learning; and Communication for Effective Implementation.
Part II is devoted to eight case studies from the Southern Africa region that illustrates some of the issues considered in Part I. They are included to provide material that can be used as site-specific examples and teaching aids to complement general discussion of the issues." />
