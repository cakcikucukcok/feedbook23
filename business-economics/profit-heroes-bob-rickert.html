  <title>Profit Heroes - Bob Rickert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Exceptional sales practices have always consisted of both art and science. Profit Heroes delves deeply into sales science as it has evolved since the Great Recession. It is both eye-opening and amazingly powerful. Dont just read it. Study it! 
Tom Hopkins, author of When Buyers Say No
Warning: Everything you know about selling is wrong. Everything you have been taught before today is wrong. This book will upset you. You will have to relearn everything. You will have to learn about a new mindset: a profit mindset.
Todd Schnick, CEO of Dreamland Media
The first two chapters are absolutely riveting. You read about a salesperson who lost the sale and was devastated. You read about the salesperson who won the sale. Anyone who has sold has felt both of these emotions. But Bob Rickert makes those emotions palpable. Once he hooks you emotionally, he provides the roadmap for winning more and bigger deals. If you want to be seen as a peera businessperson who happens to sellinstead of just another salesperson, Profit Heroes belongs at the top of your must-read list. 
Chris Lytle, author of The Accidental Salesperson
Now, more than ever, salespeople need to understand finance and profitability if they are to sell effectively to the C-suite. Fortunately, Bob Rickert has written an informative and thoroughly enjoyable book that provides a roadmap for salespeople seeking to become Profit Heroes. Using realistic examples, Bob paints a picture of how to sell successfully using executive board language, and contrasts it with the unsuccessful strategy of a firm that takes a different approach. I highly recommend this book to anyone in the sales arena.
