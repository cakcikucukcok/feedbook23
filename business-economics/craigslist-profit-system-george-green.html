  <title>Craigslist Profit System - George Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is George Green and I have been earning a very good living online for several years now. All without a single website or social network account by exclusively promoting offers on Craigslist posting free ads. While my initial results were acceptable they were not spectacular. I knew that if I could place several ads in all geographic regions on a regular basis that my results would skyrocket. I spent countless hours and thousands of dollars doing research and investigating resources. After much frustrating trial and error I finally cracked the code. And my results certainly did skyrocket! Finally I realized that any internet marketer could benefit tremendously form this powerful information. With 30 Million visitors per month and thousands of offers available to promote that competition would never be a concern. I also knew that I could teach my system to anyone and allow them to create a highly profitable business working from home." />
