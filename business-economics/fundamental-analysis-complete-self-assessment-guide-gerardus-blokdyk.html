  <title>Fundamental Analysis Complete Self-Assessment Guide - Gerardus Blokdyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who is the Fundamental Analysis process owner? Risk factors: what are the characteristics of Fundamental Analysis that make it risky? Why are Fundamental Analysis skills important? What other areas of the organization might benefit from the Fundamental Analysis team’s improvements, knowledge, and learning? What would be the goal or target for a Fundamental Analysis&#39;s improvement team? 
&lt;p&gt;
Defining, designing, creating, and implementing a process to solve a business challenge or meet a business objective is the most valuable role… In EVERY company, organization and department.
&lt;p&gt;
Unless you are talking a one-time, single-use project within a business, there should be a process. Whether that process is managed and implemented by humans, AI, or a combination of the two, it needs to be designed by someone with a complex enough perspective to ask the right questions. Someone capable of asking the right questions and step back and say, &#39;What are we really trying to accomplish here? And is there a different way to look at it?&#39;
&lt;p&gt;
For more than twenty years, The Art of Service&#39;s Self-Assessments empower people who can do just that - whether their title is marketer, entrepreneur, manager, salesperson, consultant, business process manager, executive assistant, IT Manager, CxO etc... - they are the people who rule the future. They are people who watch the process as it happens, and ask the right questions to make the process work better.
&lt;p&gt;
