  <title>The Adventures of an IT Leader, Updated Edition with a New Preface by the Authors - Robert D. Austin, Shannon O&#39;Donnell, Richard L. Nolan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;What does it take to lead and manage your company&amp;#8217;s tech?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Becoming an effective IT leader and manager presents a host of challenges&amp;#151;from anticipating emerging technologies, to managing relationships with senior executives, vendors, and employees, to communicating with the board. A good IT leader must also be a strong business leader.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book&amp;#151;now thoroughly updated with a new preface by the authors and current tech details and terminology&amp;#151;invites you to accompany new CIO Jim Barton as he steps up to leadership at his company. You&amp;#8217;ll get a deeper understanding of the role of IT in your own organization as you see Jim struggle through a tough first year, handling (and fumbling) all kinds of management challenges. Although fictional, the scenarios are based on the authors&amp;#8217; long experience working with real-life companies across industries and sectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Adventures of an IT Leader&lt;/I&gt; is both an insightful story and an instructive guidebook. You can read it from beginning to end or treat it as a series of cases, skipping around to different chapters that address your most pressing needs. (For example, if you need to learn about crisis management and security, read chapters 10&amp;#150;12.) You can also test yourself and think about how to use the book&amp;#8217;s lessons in your own company by reading the authors&amp;#8217; &amp;#147;Reflection&amp;#8221; questions at the end of each chapter.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book is your indispensable manual for IT management and leadership, no matter what business you&amp;#8217;re in.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
