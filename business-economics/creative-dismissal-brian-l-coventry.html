  <title>Creative Dismissal - Brian L. Coventry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Disappointing former clients
But I was quickly learning that maybe I should rethink about how I want to spend my time. North Bay was besieged with Life Insurance Agents, Investment Agents and the competition was fierce.  I had a former Commercial client that Id set up in business years previous. Id seen him through some rough periods as he established himself against the North Bay competition in his field. Now that I was no longer the Manager of the Bank (Caisse) he begrudgingly agreed to let me do a proposal to him and his Common Law spouse over which I laboured for many hours. One night I made the presentation to them. At one point he appeared to be wanting to look macho and protecting his gal pal from the big bad Investment Companies. I was told: Well get back to you.
                           WHAT HAVE YOU DONE FOR ME LATELY??
A few days later my former and unappreciative Bank client called me and told me that he had Robert Dick, another Investment Counsellor  who worked for Investors Syndicate had reviewed my in-depth presentation and tore it to pieces, and came up with a better plan. Of course he did, I said. Whaddya mean, Leslie? he asked.
I said: It doesnt take much talent to take some one elses work and do a major critique of it especially if the end result is you will receive a commission cheque.  He will put you and your girlfriend into the flavour of the month that earns him the biggest bucks. My plan was taking into account your spouses obvious risk aversion. Anyway you go with Mr.Dick and let me know in a year or to if you are ahead or behind. Anyway, thanks for letting me offer you my companys service and our personalized plan and I wish you the best. No hard feelings.
He seemed quite embarrassed momentarily, but I grabbed his hand shacked it and walked away feeling good about the encounter." />
