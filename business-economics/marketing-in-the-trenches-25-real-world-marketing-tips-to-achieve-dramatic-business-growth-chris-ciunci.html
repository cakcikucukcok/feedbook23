  <title>Marketing In the Trenches: 25 Real - World Marketing Tips to Achieve Dramatic Business Growth - Chris Ciunci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marketing in the Trenches is written for business owners hungry to achieve their firm&#39;s growth potential. This book is not an academic exercise. Rather, it is a collection of real-world examples of the problems that today&#39;s business owners face, along with examples of actionable business solutions that can be implemented. The tips from the trenches contain actual cases, tangible statistics, and specific takeaways that can be implemented right away.   Quite simply, the growth of your company can no longer rely on a single department or on traditional tactics to carry such a heavy burden. This is the perspective from which this book is written, so you can expect to learn far more than how to deploy email campaigns, write taglines, or perform traditional tactics. We&#39;ll leave that to all of the other marketing books." />
