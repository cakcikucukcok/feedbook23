  <title>New Profits From The Monetary Crisis - Harry Browne, Roger Lipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Introduction by Publisher - Roger Lipton: Harry Browne not only told a good story; he proved to be right, which in the financial world is all important. There are few financial commentators who can document the success of their recommendations as well as Harry Browne did in the turbulent 1970s. He recommended gold at $35.00/oz. in 1970 and continued to recommend it at $150.00/oz. in 1974. Most impressive, after gold had continued rising until 1978, one of the themes of New Profits from the Monetary Crisis was &quot;the easy money has been made&quot;. In spite of his success to that point, he had the humility and perspective to advise diversifying in the interest of long term safety.  So much of what Harry described in 1970, 1974, and 1978 is still pertinent today.  On the following pages thirty four years ago he wrote about more crisis to come, the government&#39;s inability to step aside and let the free market work, the effect of wage and price controls (e.g. today&#39;s control of interest rates), the long term problems with social security, and why &quot;no investment is forever&quot;, including gold and silver. New Profits is guaranteed to be thought provoking at the least, if not crucial to your financial well being and peace of mind.  It was &quot;peace of mind&quot; that was Harry Browne&#39;s fondest wish for you." />
