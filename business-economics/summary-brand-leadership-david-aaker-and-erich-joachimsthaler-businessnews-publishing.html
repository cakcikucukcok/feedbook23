  <title>Summary: Brand-Leadership - David Aaker and Erich Joachimsthaler - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “BRAND LEADERSHIP: The Evolving Paradigm” by David Aaker and Erich Joachimsthaler.&lt;br&gt;David Aaker is Vice-Chairman of Prophet Brand Strategy, a strategic professional services firm, and a Professor Emeritus at the Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley. He is widely acknowledged as the preeminent authority on brand equity and brand strategy. Erich Joachimsthaler is CEO of The Brand Leadership Company, a strategy consulting and management education firm, and Visiting Professor of Business Administration at the Darden School, University of Virginia.&lt;br&gt;In Brand Leadership, Aaker and Joachimsthaler argue that creating and progressively building strong brands is an important commercial activity for most business enterprises. However, the way that strong brands are built is rapidly changing and evolving. A new paradigm is emerging in which achieving brand leadership is becoming more important than simply building brand equity.&lt;br&gt;In effect, the paradigm for brand building is evolving from the tactical and reactive approach of traditional brand management to the much more strategic and visionary brand leadership approach. &lt;br&gt;Brand Leadership is a very useful book that teaches you how to overcome and address the challenges brought by today’s new brand paradigm." />
