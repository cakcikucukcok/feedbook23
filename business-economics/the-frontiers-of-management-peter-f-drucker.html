  <title>The Frontiers of Management - Peter F. Drucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Every decision executives make today shapes the future of their organization - as well as that of the communities and society in which the organization operates. How to make choices that lead to the best possible future for all stakeholders? Look beyond the immediate crisis of the day - to the long-term implications of your decisions and actions. In the thirty-five essays comprising The Frontiers of Management, classic management thinker and teacher Peter Drucker offers advice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Each selection in this compelling collection is as fresh and relevant today as it was when written in the 1980s. With every essay, Drucker teaches by example- deftly demonstrating how to put current events in their larger historical context, how to pick the right people for a given task, how to think through an acquisition.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book provides not only durable examples of a great thinker&#39;s writing but a set of ever more urgently needed lessons on how business leaders today can understand the context of their own daily decisions - and make the wisest possible choices for the future.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Timely and vivid, The Frontiers of Management remains a practical guidebook packed with enduring wisdom.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
