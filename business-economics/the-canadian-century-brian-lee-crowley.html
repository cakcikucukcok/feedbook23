  <title>The Canadian Century - Brian Lee Crowley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One hundred years ago a great Canadian, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, predicted that the twentieth century would belong to Canada. He had a plan to make it so. What happened? Canada lost sight of Laurier&amp;#39;s plan and failed to claim its century, dwelling instead in the long shadow of the United States. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No more! Co-authors Brian Crowley, Jason Clemens and Niels Veldhuis envision Canada&amp;#39;s emergence as an economic and social power. They argue, while the United States was busy precipitating a global economic disaster, Canada was on a path that could lead it into an era of unprecedented prosperity. It won&amp;#39;t be easy. We must be prepared to follow through on reforms enacted and complete the work already begun. If so, Canada will become the country that Laurier foretold, a land of work for all who want it, of opportunity, investment, innovation and prosperity. Laurier said that the twentieth century belonged to Canada. He was absolutely right; he was merely off by 100 years." />
