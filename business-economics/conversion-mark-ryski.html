  <title>Conversion - Mark Ryski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Retailers today are able to generate the critical customer information on traffic and conversion rates that turn from their traditional anecdotal reflections  in Conversion Mark Ryski tells us all that we need to know to make that shift a reality. A true find for any retailer looking for dramatic improvements in business outcomes!&lt;br /&gt;
 Len Schlesinger President, Babson College&lt;br /&gt;
former Vice Chairman and COO, Limited Brands&lt;br /&gt;
A retail brand is built from the cumulative effects of its shoppers experiences over time, making learning from these experiences a strategic priority for retailers in order to drive business value. Converting customers into buyers is the first step in creating a sustained partnership that results in value for all. The strategies introduced in this book will help retailers of all sizes and categories convert their customers experiences into future buyers.&lt;br /&gt;
 Pat Conroy Vice Chairman, Deloitte LLP&lt;br /&gt;
&amp; Consumer Products Practice Leader&lt;br /&gt;
Half the battle is finding the right things to measure for your business and industry. Ryski is right that conversion is a critical metric for retailers who care about revenue, profits, and growth.&lt;br /&gt;
