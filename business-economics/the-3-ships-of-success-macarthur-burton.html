  <title>The 3-Ships of Success - MacArthur Burton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No matter what format your business may take, sole proprietor, partnership, corporation, etc., there are three ships that you must become intimately familiar with; leadership, followership, and relationship. The 3-Ship of Success is a powerful message on the importance of each ship individually and collectively, and provided positive, succinct insight on how to navigate the waters of business on each ship in order to be successful. You will gain a new understanding of what the expectations of a leader truly are, the true importance of the follower and why care must be given in the selection &amp; training of the follower, and the make &amp; break activities of the all important relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a retired senior naval officer, I know a little something about ships. The analogies Mac draws with the 3-Ships are some of the most practical and powerful you will come across. No matter what your level of business, you need this book! No nonsense, to the point, sometimes humorous, but always in your face, this book is an instant winner!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard McNeil, Financial Strategist&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the reading of Macs book I discovered that he did not try to introduce any new theory that readers had to experience. He simply laid out a path for anyone to follow to be successful. His information is sound, and it paints a picture for all viewers to see a straight, no thrills, no catch praise, no magic bullet scene. I encourage you to gain knowledge from this short, powerful, and clearly expressed writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PhD Larry D. Palmer, Sr., Bishop, Israel Total Life Ministries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first heard Mack describes his concept of the 3-Ships I was amazed at the simplicity of the way it was presented. I immediately realized the ease of application especially in a training environment for business leaders. This one is a winner!&lt;/p&gt;
