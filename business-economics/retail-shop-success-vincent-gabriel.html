  <title>Retail Shop Success - Vincent Gabriel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I put down what I have learnt when I had to run a retail shop. It was a humbling experience because retailing is so complex. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Customers depend on you, and suppliers always have their own agendas and push what they think you should sell. However these are not what customers want to buy. Your duty is to the customer.&lt;br&gt;At the same time, your investors trust you to bring back a certain return on their backing and support for you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally I found the secret of Success and I am sharing it with you. This book is dedicated to the thousands of hardworking vendors. Never give up. Retailing will always be rewarding." />
