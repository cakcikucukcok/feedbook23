  <title>Summary: Beyond Booked Solid - Michael Port - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book &quot;BEYOND BOOKED SOLID: Your Business, Your Life, Your Way – It’s All Inside&quot; by Michael Port.&lt;br&gt;Michael Port runs his own corporate consulting and coaching business. He has been described by the Wall Street Journal as a &quot;marketing guru&quot;.&lt;br&gt;In Beyond Booked Solid, he argues that you have to reach the stage where you are &quot;booked solid&quot; – where you’re getting as much work as you can handle by yourself. Once you reach that stage, a new challenge arises. You now have to grow and develop your business so, instead of being a small operation which takes all your time and energy, it becomes a bigger and better business which pays you more while you work less.&lt;br&gt;The Beyond Booked Solid Challenge is to turn a one-person operation into a highly successful and self sustaining enterprise which can serve more clients than ever before. &lt;br&gt;Beyond Booked Solid will teach you how to leverage what you’re good at so you can spend more time doing that and less time doing all the other stuff that’s required. This interesting book gives you the key in choosing the business architecture that’s most appropriate for your circumstances and preferences." />
