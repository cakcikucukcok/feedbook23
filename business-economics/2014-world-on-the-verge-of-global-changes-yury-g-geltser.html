  <title>2014 - World on the Verge of Global Changes - Yury G. Geltser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this article is to familiarize the reader with the materials being prepared for publication of the book by Yury G. Geltser &quot;Fundamentals of Predictable Economy.&quot;  For the first time, the author outlines the economic theory through the language of General System Theory.  One of the essential characteristics of systems is their cyclical development.  Recurrence of processes is not recognized by the author as cyclicality; he offers other rigorous criteria.  Based on the analysis the author argues that the socio-economic systems must have cyclicality in the range of 20-25 years.  With that, the beginning of the next cycle should be expected to start in December 2014.  Transition period will take 6 - 7 years.  In the article comprised of the excerpts from his book, the author has made an attempt to give forecast of the expected changes.  This book is designed not only to change our understanding of the crises, but also of many of the theses of the economic theory itself, which many now deem immutable." />
