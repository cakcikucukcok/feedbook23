      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not a question. It is a philosophy to live by. It&#39;s Donny Deutsch&#39;s motto. And it is the secret possessed by every person with the right stuff&amp;#8212;the one-in-a-hundred who gets to the top of their team, their company, their business, their industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is an assignment or a promotion up for grabs, a client or account looking for new answers, do you know how to go for it? Donny Deutsch built a billion-dollar media business asking himself the basic question, &quot;&lt;em&gt;Why Not Me?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; Once the reader asks&amp;#8212;and answers&amp;#8212;that question, a world of opportunity opens up. It is a tool to motivate people, build a business, and create a business culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Often Wrong, Never in Doubt&lt;/em&gt; is an inspirational book from one of America&#39;s most colorful and exciting entrepreneurs. It&#39;s Donny&#39;s story. In a fun conversation with the reader, Donny lays out the core principles that propelled him to create tremendous wealth, build a huge and influential business, and become a national personality. Using inside stories of the media, the advertising industry, and a youth spent growing up on the streets of New York, Donny gives the commonsense bottom line that he has learned along the way, broken down into real, relevant, and inspiring lessons that will be useful to everyone from the front-line salesperson to the middle manager to the successful corporate executive. (It&#39;s also a useful guide for dating.)&lt;/p&gt;" />
