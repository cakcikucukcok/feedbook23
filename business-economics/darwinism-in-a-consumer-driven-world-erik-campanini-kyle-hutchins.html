  <title>Darwinism in a Consumer-Driven World - Erik Campanini, Kyle Hutchins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Modern companies should focus more on their &quot;improvisation  capabilities&quot; that rely on data, innovation, collaboration and  individuals&#39; own adaptation capabilities. Erik and Kyle provide a useful  framework to think corporate strategy from a different perspective in  this book that perfectly applies evolutionist theory to the digital  age.&quot;&lt;br/&gt;
Vincent Stuhlen, Global Head of Digital, l&#39;Oréal, Luxury Division&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Erik and Kyle help every executive to understand the impact of the  technology revolution we are experiencing. Readers will find in these  pages valuable insights on the importance of change and adapting their  business to this new world.”&lt;br/&gt;
Alex Dayon, President Applications &amp; Platform, Salesforce.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This book serves as a practical guide, stems from well-selected real  world examples and blossoms into four nature-inspired models for  customer relationship management.”&lt;br/&gt;
Xi Zhang, Strategy Senior Manager, China Resources Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For the financial services industry, where competition is intense  and consumers are in charge, the frameworks and analogies offered  provide practical ideas for staying ahead and thriving in a  consumer-driven world.”&lt;br/&gt;
Karyn Furstman, Customer Experience Executive, Safeco Insurance, a Liberty Mutual company&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This darwinian approach, which comes from the B2C world, is also  quite present in our B2B environment. It’s a source of inspiration that  helps us better understand the needs of our customers, be it our  industrial partners or our end users/ passengers.”&lt;br/&gt;
Yann Barbaux, SVP Innovation, Airbus S.A.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hutchins and Campanini provide a memorable framework that balances  rapid adaptation with reliable delivery. It’s a must read for any  business that finds it challenging to keep up with the exponential  growth of customer expectations.”&lt;br/&gt;
Deanna Oppenheimer, CEO CameoWorks, Global Board Member of Tesco&lt;/p&gt;" />
