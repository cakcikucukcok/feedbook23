  <title>Credit Management for Property Professionals - Duncan Grubb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Regardless of their background, UK Property Professionals often find themselves having to make Credit Management decisions on a daily basis without either training or experience. This book provides an accessible reference guide, covering all the main transactional events which Property Professionals encounter in the course of their work, with advice and case studies demonstrating how to minimise financial exposure and eliminate loss. This is not a text book, rather it is a simple set of touch points and no go areas which will enable anyone in the commercial property industry to avoid the pitfalls that so many people encounter when conducting business in good faith with others. In my thirty plus years in the credit industry, much of it in property, I’ve come across most of the situations that can crop up to disrupt the landlord and tenant relationship, and in this book I share my thoughts, experiences, procedures and remedies in the hope that others may learn the easy way!" />
