  <title>Certain Security - Brian Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Through investment visa programs administered by US Citizenship and Immigration Services, more than 7,000 families have immigrated to the United States, investing more than three billion dollars over the past twenty-two years.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Certain Security&lt;/i&gt;, author Brian Dickens shares proven tools and strategies families can use to achieve personal and financial security through valuable and little-known programs. He describes the history and detailed requirements of the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program and explains why this may be the best time in history to invest and live in the United States. He also discusses choosing a qualified EB-5 investment and introduces his four-step  process for successfully navigating US investment visa programs.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Certain Security&lt;/i&gt; examines US Citizenship and Immigration Services and its process for administering visas. Dickens then presents general information relative to taxation and immigrant investment and explores how US companies become eligible to attract these investments. He also shares secrets to identifying qualified service providers to help investors through the investment visa process.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dickens personal immigration experience with his own family, combined with his clinical expertise from the investment visa industry and general investment and business-development industries, provides insight into these exciting programs from multiple perspectives. &lt;i&gt;Certain Security&lt;/i&gt; serves as a valuable resource for those who wish to learn about these programs, overcome fear of change, and lead their families to safety and security in the United States.&lt;p&gt;" />
