  <title>The Arch &amp; the Path - Michael H. Shenkman, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;Visit the author&#39;s website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archofleadership.com&quot;&gt;www.archofleadership.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Arch and the Path:  The Life of Leading Greatly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
is not your usual book on leadership: it depicts the arduous and joyful path leaders must take in order to guide succesful organizations. Great leaders of successful organizations, according to Shenkman, open peoples lives to more expansive and encompassing possibilities.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Creative leading requires a commitment.  It is not a commitment everyone will make.  And once made, the commitment brings with it special demands.  The life of leading is a response to those demands.  If leaders are to sustain their efforts in their chosen role, learning the disciplines and practices of the life of leading is essential.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a mentor to leaders of successful organizations of all types, Shenkmanhas helped many aspiring exceutives to lead greatly. The Arch and the Path summarizes and crystalizes the many experiences those executives have had in becoming great leaders. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
According to Charles E. Hoffman, CEO and President of Covad Communications, Inc.,for leaders who aspire not only to success, but to affect peoples lives in important ways, &quot;this book is essential reading.&quot;" />
