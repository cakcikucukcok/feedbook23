  <title>Leadership in the Bible - Paul Ohana, David Arnow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based on current thinking and research from the fields of management and psychology, Leadership in the Bible provides guidance about the most effective ways of responding to forty challenging situations you encounter every day. This guidance is grounded in the wisdom of three key figures in Hebrew scriptureAbraham, Joseph, and Moses. It explores how they coped with similar challenges, and it provides recommendations about how to respond to these situations at work or at home. Each chapter ends with an essential lesson, a lesson that was true thousands of years ago and remains so today. 
Its refreshing to find new approaches [to leadership] that are useful in both our personal and professional lives . . . A worthwhile read for anyone looking to strengthen their skills (Susan Cohn Rockefeller, HuffPost Books).
Arnow and Ohana have put the Hebrew Bible back in business. Through their insightful and creative readings, they distill a spiritual business model for the 21st century (Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, Emanu-El scholar at Congregation Emanu-El of San Francisco, author of a score of books on spirituality, Judaism, and kabbalah)." />
