  <title>Stop The Slip - Thom Disch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fixing a $150 billion healthcare crisis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 1999, we have reduced deaths from heart disease 15%. Deaths caused by auto accidents are down 12%. &lt;strong&gt;But deaths from falls have increased over 150%.&lt;/strong&gt; Both injuries and deaths caused by falls are at record highs and the problem continues to grow. We&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to fix the human heart and we have made driving safer. Now is the time to focus on preventing fall injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falls are the leading cause of emergency room visits in the US, with over 9 million injuries in 2014. &lt;em&gt;Stop the Slip&lt;/em&gt; shows how you can prevent these injuries. Thom Disch combines personal, real life stories with an in-depth look at this problem. Everyone falls, but falls don&amp;rsquo;t just happen, they&amp;rsquo;re preceded by other events. When you eliminate those events, you reduce the risk of falling. Following the simple five step A-L-E-R-T System&amp;trade; will reduce your risk of falling.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you read this book you&amp;rsquo;ll also discover many interesting and surprising facts. For example: Falls kill 7 times more people than the flu. Winter weather appears to be a much smaller cause of fall deaths than you might expect. Falls cause nearly 4 times more emergency room visits than auto accidents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is undeniable proof that falls are preventable. You owe it to yourself and your loved ones to learn how you can reduce the risk of a fall injury.&lt;/p&gt;" />
