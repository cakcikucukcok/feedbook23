  <title>(Re)Consider your Service Value proposition - Andrew Manning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Services form the largest parts of most developed economies, and a growing part of emerging economies too. And all organisations contain in-house service teams and departments. So, this book is relevant to you, whatever, or wherever, your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO (RE)CONSIDER YOUR SERVICE OFFERING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because, the market for services is becoming even more competitive. This may be increased competition for customers, employees, other resources, budgets, profi ts or capital. Traditional service models are being shaken up by the tech and digital revolution; people are competing with technology, which can either support them or make them redundant. Even the need for real estate is being supplanted by &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; premises. Public services are competing for decreasing government expenditure against a background of increased demand and rising service level expectations, and against private sector and third sector alternatives. In-house service teams, such as finance, HR, IT and marketing, are competing with outsourced alternatives, which may be &amp;ldquo;offshore&amp;rdquo;. This book provides a practical framework for service organisations to identify, consider, and respond to these challenges, and to avoid the many pitfalls that can exist in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;" />
