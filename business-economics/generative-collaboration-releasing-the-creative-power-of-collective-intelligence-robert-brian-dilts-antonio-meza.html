  <title>Generative Collaboration: Releasing the Creative Power of Collective Intelligence - Robert Brian Dilts, Antonio Meza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Working together with others in groups and teams is an increasingly common and important part of modern business and contemporary life.&amp;nbsp; High performing teams demonstrate the characteristic of collective intelligence. &lt;em&gt;Collective intelligence&lt;/em&gt; relates to the ability of people in a team, group or organization to think and act in an aligned and coordinated fashion&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The fruit of effective collective intelligence is what is known as generative collaboration&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Generative collaboration&lt;/em&gt; involves people working together to create or generate something new, surprising and beyond the capacities of any of the group members individually. Through generative collaboration, individuals are able to utilize their abilities to the fullest and discover and apply resources that they did not yet realize that they had. They draw new ideas and resources out of each other. Thus, the performance or output of the group as a whole is much &lt;em&gt;greater&lt;/em&gt; than it would be if the individuals were working by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book is for people who want to increase their capacity for working effectively together with others and to experience the excitement, satisfaction and power of generative collaboration.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
