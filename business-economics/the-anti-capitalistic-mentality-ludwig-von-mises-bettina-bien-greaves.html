  <title>The Anti-capitalistic Mentality - Ludwig Von Mises, Bettina Bien Greaves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Anti-capitalistic Mentality,&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; the respected economist Ludwig von Mises plainly explains the causes of the irrational fear and hatred many intellectuals and others feel for capitalism. In five concise chapters, he traces the causation of the misunderstandings and resultant fears that cause resistance to economic development and social change. He enumerates and rebuts the economic arguments against and the psychological and social objections to economic freedom in the form of capitalism. Written during the heyday of twentieth-century socialism, this work provides the reader with lucid and compelling insights into human reactions to capitalism.&lt;B&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Ludwig von Mises&lt;/STRONG&gt; (1881&amp;#8211;1973)&amp;#160;was the leading spokesman of the Austrian School of Economics throughout most of the twentieth century. He earned his doctorate in law and economics from the University of Vienna in 1906. In 1926, Mises founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research. From 1909 to 1934, he was an economist for the Vienna Chamber of Commerce. Before the &lt;I&gt;Anschluss&lt;/I&gt;, in 1934 Mises left for Geneva, where he was a professor at the Graduate Institute of International Studies until 1940, when he emigrated to New York City.
