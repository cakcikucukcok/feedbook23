  <title>Invisible Influence - Kevin Hogan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Invisible Influence&lt;/i&gt; is a masterpiece in understanding the science of influence and how to take it from convincing to compelling. Kevin Hogan shows you in plain English how to understand, apply, and master the science of persuasion. The book is brilliant— and you can be brilliantly persuasive. Buy the book, read the book, and implement the book.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;—Jeffrey Gitomer&lt;/b&gt;, author of &lt;i&gt;The Sales Bible&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Little Book of Leadership&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;One eyebrow-raising, head-whacking, forehead-slapping technique after another. Anyone whose daily life depends on influencing people—in other words, everyone—should read this book. Buy copies for your friends and hide it from your enemies.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;—Richard Brodie&lt;/b&gt;, author of &lt;i&gt;Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Master persuaders know that it&#39;s not really about the words you use or the moves you make—other people get persuaded because of &lt;i&gt;what you think&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;how you feel&lt;/i&gt;. Kevin Hogan explains in delightfully clear detail how to make these master-persuader secrets work for you. Not only that, he also explains &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt; all of this works, and he shows you the exact scientific research that proves it!&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;—David Garfinkel&lt;/b&gt;, author of &lt;i&gt;Advertising Headlines That Make You Rich&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Invisible Influence&lt;/i&gt; is a masterpiece. It will be the master influencer&#39;s reference book for the years to come. Invisible influence is like oxygen, you can&#39;t see it, but your life depends on it. In this book, you will discover the persuasion tactics that will compel your clients to say yes to you—again and again.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;—Roberto Monaco&lt;/b&gt;, www.influenceology.com&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Dump the script—it&#39;s old news before the ink&#39;s dry. Trust yourself and use your new understanding of the ever-changing context to succeed. In his fascinating book, Hogan weaves established research findings into a handbook for successful influence. The guidelines are obvious but hidden, simple but profound. Understand them and you&#39;ve mastered the complex and crucial art of persuasion.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;—William D. Crano&lt;/b&gt;, author of &lt;i&gt;The Rules of Influence: Winning When You&#39;re in the Minority&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Many write on the topic of persuasion. Precious few genuinely understand it. Kevin is one of those precious few. Read everything you can by him.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;b&gt;—Mark Joyner&lt;/b&gt;, founder and CEO of Simpleology, www.simpleology.com&lt;/p&gt;" />
