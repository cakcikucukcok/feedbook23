  <title>Apollo Memories - Martin Kielty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From 1927 until 1985 the Glasgow Apollo was a landmark in Glasgow&#39;s architecture and culture.

Everyone who was anyone took to the infamously high stage and performed to an audience regarded as the most discerning music fans in the world. From AC/DC to Led Zeppelin, Johnny Cash to the Style Council, the Apollo was synonymous with good, loud music and electric energy. Built as a showpiece palace in the great era of live entertainment, it was a giant and elaborate building capable of seating up to 4,500 people. It was renowned before the Apollo years as a unique experience, and the rock&#39;n&#39;roll years only added to its fame.

This is the full story of those rock years before the Apollo closed for good.
