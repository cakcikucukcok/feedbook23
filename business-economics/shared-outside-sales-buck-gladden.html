  <title>Shared Outside Sales - Buck Gladden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Shared Outside Sales (SOS) system is a proven system and an alternative to a full-time sales job with one company. It allows the salesperson the freedom to sell the kind of products and services he has the most knowledge of or most likes selling. He chooses his own clients and sets his own salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SOS system allows a salesperson to go from employee to company owner without the usual pitfalls of opening a new business. If the salespersons business is built before he leaves his current job, there is no break in income. Job satisfaction and job security are increased, and the pressure associated with generating sales for a single employer is decreased. The SOS system allows the salesperson to work business around his life rather than working his life around business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are opportunities for business growth and a substantially increased income. By building relationships with multiple companies and customers, other opportunities may also arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOOD LUCK!&lt;/p&gt;" />
