  <title>Homelessness in Nigeria - Ifeadikanwa Chidebell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Homelessness in Nigeria: Investigating Africas Housing Crisis, is a daring confrontation of a topic considered taboo in Africa. 
Equally daring is the nature and depth of information it provides through a holistic exploration of the subject of homelessness as it occurs in Africa and in the majority of the poor nations of the modern world. 
But Nigeria is a wealthy nation, given its vast human and natural resources. So, why has homelessness remained a challenge to this nation? How and when did homelessness become part of the Nigerian culture? Is there such a word as homelessness in any Nigerian or other African languages? Who and what has been generating this housing dilemma? What policy and practices are in place that perpetuate or attempt to address homelessness in the region? What are the housed- and homeless Nigerians views of this predicament? What is the predictable future of Nigerias homelessness quandary?
These questions and more find responses in this book, as it explores the antecedents, the origins, and the current state of homelessness in that nation. To respond effectively to these numerous questions it examines the land use policy, housing and economic policy, past and present, as well as the history and status of housing codes, the building and rental laws in effect, comparing them with actual practices. 
This exercise exposes the significant roles of culture and emerging world view imports, as well as the direct roles of stakeholders, rulers and the ruled alike, in the dynamics of the homelessness scourge. 
In its quest for deep insights into homelessness, which spans over nine years of information search, I have drawn from a wide range of literary work. And, for the purposes of first hand information gathering on this poorly researched subject. I invested in inter-continental travels. Direct interactions with homeless and housed persons in the target location, as well as communication with Africans in the Diaspora has contributed even more comprehensive information on the underlying causes, nature and status of shelter poverty among Africans. 
There is a strong emphasizes in this book of the dominant roles of culture, religion and sectional politics in the creation and perpetuation of Africas homelessness and housing crises. And insights into this dynamic unveil answers to crucial, unanswered questions on homelessness in Africa as no known existing literature ever has. 
 Meanwhile, in the guise of a tool of advocacy against homelessness and its accompanying stigma, this document is diametrically opposed to the shroud that mask the unconscionable injustice that is homelessness, particularly in communal-based, wealthy social environment, such as Nigeria. 
 In these ways this work offers ample information to Africans and all stakeholders in the homelessness eradication struggle. Grassroot populations, policymakers, invested foreign non- profit agencies, and all stake holders alike, will find within these pages numerous significant facts on homelessness as it occurs in modern developing nations. They will equally discover viable suggestions for combating and addressing shelter loss.
Homelessness in Nigeria is indeed a vital reference- as well as literary hand book for all who seek knowledge on African cultures, and, indeed, on cultures of the general Global South nations, and even more pointedly in matters of culture associated with housing. Professionals from all walks of life will thus find this a source of much insight in understanding regional diversity with regard to values relative to shelter deprivation." />
