  <title>The Making of Miracles in Indian States: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, and Gujarat - M. Govinda Rao, Arvind Panagariya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Growth miracles typically have been studied at the country level. In The Making of Miracles in Indian States, internationally-renowned economists Arvind Panagariya and M. Govinda Rao bring together a team of six leading scholars to break from that tradition and study three growth miracles in India at the level of the state: Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, and Gujarat.  These are three large and diverse states in India: Gujarat has the third-highest per-capita income among the largest eighteen states, Bihar is the poorest, and Andhra Pradesh falls in the middle. Despite vast differences among the states, all three have grown at rates exceeding 8% for an entire decade in the twenty-first century.  Each section of this three-part book offers a historical perspective on the states development and the specific factors that improved its economic fortunes. The three case studies are backed by extensive quantitative documentation.  They demonstrate the critical role that leadership, translated into improved policies and implementation, plays in stimulating growth and development. The Making of Miracles in Indian States is essential reading for students and scholars alike, as well as policy makers, NGO workers, and employees of international institutions." />
