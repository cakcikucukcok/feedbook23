  <title>The Perfect SENCO - Natalie Packer, Jackie Beere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The essential SENCO&#39;s guide for doing the job perfectly. Real education isn&#39;t about a race to the top of the class or the league table. It isn&#39;t about being better than anyone else or accumulating as many qualifications as you possibly can. It&#39;s about being helped to be the best you can possibly be by professionals who are skilled enough to know how to do it and compassionate enough to take the time to do it well. Nowhere is this philosophy more important than when it comes to supporting children with special educational needs and this book, commissioned for our Perfect Series by a SEN consultant with many years&#39; experience, will help you achieve just that." />
