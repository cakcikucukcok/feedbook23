  <title>Rookie Smarts - Liz Wiseman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;Bestseller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to be at your best even when you are underqualified or doing something for the first time? Is it still possible, even after decades of experience, to recapture the enthusiasm, curiosity, and fearlessness of youth to take on new challenges? With the right mindset&amp;#8212;with Rookie Smarts&amp;#8212;you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a rapidly changing world, experience can be a curse. Careers stall, innovation stops, and strategies grow stale. Being new, na&amp;#239;ve, and even clueless can be an asset. For today&amp;#8217;s knowledge workers, constant learning is more valuable than mastery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this essential guide, leadership expert Liz Wiseman explains how to reclaim and cultivate this curious, flexible, youthful mindset called&amp;#160;Rookie Smarts. She argues that the most successful rookies are hunter-gatherers&amp;#8212;alert and seeking, cautious but quick like firewalkers, and hungry and relentless like pioneers. Most importantly, she identifies a breed of leaders she refers to as &amp;#8220;perpetual rookies.&amp;#8221; Despite years of experience, they retain their rookie smarts, thinking and operating with the mindsets and practices of these high-performing rookies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rookie Smarts&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;addresses the questions every experienced professional faces: &amp;#8220;Will my knowledge and skills become obsolete and irrelevant? Will a young, inexperienced newcomer upend my company or me? How can I keep up?&amp;#8221; The answer is to stay fresh, keep learning, and know when to think like a rookie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rookie Smarts&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;isn&amp;#8217;t just for professionals seeking personal renewal; it is an indispensible resource for all leaders who must ensure their workforces remains vital and competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
