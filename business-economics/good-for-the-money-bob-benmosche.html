  <title>Good for the Money - Bob Benmosche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In  2009, at the peak of the financial crisis, AIG - the American insurance  behemoth - was sinking fast. It was the peg upon which the nation hung  its ire and resentment  during the financial crisis: the pinnacle of  Wall Street arrogance and  greed. When Bob Benmosche climbed aboard as  CEO, it was widely assumed that he would go down with his ship. In mere  months, he turned things around, pulling AIG  from the brink of  financial collapse and restoring its profitability. Before three years  were up, AIG had fully repaid its staggering debt to the U.S. government  - with interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Good for the Money &lt;/i&gt;is an unyielding  leader&#39;s memoir of a career spent fixing companies through thoughtful,  unconventional strategy. With his brash, no-holds-barred approach to the  job, Benmosche restored AIG&#39;s employee morale and good name. His is a  story of perseverance, told with refreshing irreverence in unpretentious  terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called &quot;an American hero&quot; by Andrew Ross Sorkin, author of &lt;i&gt;Too Big to Fail&lt;/i&gt;,  Benmosche was a self-made man who never forgot what life is like for  the nation&#39;s 99-percent; again and again, he pushed back against  obstinate colleagues to salvage American jobs and industry. &lt;i&gt;Good for the Money&lt;/i&gt;  affords you a front-row seat for Benmosche&#39;s heated battles with major  players from Geithner to Obama to Cuomo, and offers incomparable lessons  in leadership from the legendary CEO who changed the way Wall Street  does business.&lt;/p&gt;" />
