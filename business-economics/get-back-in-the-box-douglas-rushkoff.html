  <title>Get Back in the Box - Douglas Rushkoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Douglas Rushkoff was one of the first social commentators to identify the new culture around the internet. He has spent nearly a decade advising companies on the ways they can re-orient their businesses to the transformations the internet has caused. Through his speaking and consulting, Rushkoff has discovered an important and unrecognized shift in American business. Too many companies are panicked and operating in survival mode when the worst of the crisis has already passed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Likening the internet transformation to the intellectual and technological ferment of the Enlightment, Rushkoff suggests we have a remarkable opportunity to re-integrate our new perspective with the work we actually do. Instead of running around trying to &quot;think out of the box,&quot; Rushkoff demonstrates, now is the time to &quot;get back in the box&quot; and improve the way we do our jobs, run our operations and drive innovation from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Combining stories gleaned from his consulting with a thrilling tour of history&#39;s dramatic moments and clever readings of cultural shift we&#39;ve just experienced, Rushkoff offers a compelling vision of the simple and effective ways businesses can re-invigorate themselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
