  <title>That Sugar Book - Damon Gameau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Based on the documentary THAT SUGAR FILM,  this is an explosive exposé of the dangers of sugar.When Australian actor and filmmaker Damon Gameau met a girl he wanted to  impress, he decided to get healthy by reducing his sugar intake. In no time he  was slimmer, calmer, fitter and happier. But he was also curious: why did the  elimination of sugar have such beneficial effects? He decided to experiment by  eating 40 teaspoons of sugar a day over the course of 60 days. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The  results were staggering. Gameau gained nearly 20 pounds; he developed signs of  fatty liver disease; and doctors warned him that he was on the road to obesity,  diabetes, and heart disease. His journey took him not just down a path to  illness, but deep into an investigation into how our food is made and marketed.  Gameau interviewed experts and discovered that 80% of products on our  supermarket shelves contain sugar, and that 90 million Americans have fatty  liver disease directly linked to their sugar consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expanding on  &lt;i&gt;That Sugar Film&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;That Sugar Book&lt;/i&gt; offers 30 recipes, in-depth  interviews, and colorful graphic images to reveal the truth behind the world&#39;s  alarming and health-destroying sugar habit. It contains sensible advice on  kicking the sugar addiction; lists which foods to avoid; and explains how to  shop, how to read labels, and how to cook sugar-free food. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A riveting,  funny, meticulously well-researched, and shocking exposé, &lt;i&gt;That Sugar Book&lt;/i&gt;  is destined to change the eating habits of a generation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
