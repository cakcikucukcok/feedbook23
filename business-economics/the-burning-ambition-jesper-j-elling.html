  <title>The Burning Ambition - Jesper J. Elling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you for your interest in my new book.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this, my fourth book, I will share all my insights and secrets about breakthrough leadership with you. How you can create extraordinary and lasting breakthrough growth in top and bottom line performance, &quot;simply&quot; by changing the way you lead the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From &quot;burning platform&quot; to &quot;burning ambition&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most industries and companies have now adapted to the new world order of recession or the post-recession zero growth environment. This means that most companies no longer have to fight for their life on a day-to-day basis and the idea of using the &quot;burning platform&quot; is more or less gone. The recession was a great chance to rethink, redirect and reinvent the company. If you utilized that opportunity I guess that your company is close to being in the best shape ever. This means it is time to capitalize on the great additional potential in the marketplace and in the, company  by creating a &quot;burning ambition&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of the &quot;burning platform&quot; is pain driven. The situation is painful and you have got to run. &quot;Where to&quot; does not really matter. The alternative, the concept of &quot;burning ambition&quot;, is pleasure driven  it is about a particularly attractive situation or state that you want to realize  a place you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most companies have a huge potential that can be liberated through breakthrough leadership. It is not unlikely that top and bottom-line performance can be grown by 25 to 50 per cent year-on-year via breakthrough leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with you believing in the additional potential. If you do this in the right way the upside is fantastic and the potential downside is close to non-existent. This is the optimal situation and starting point for your transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me on my breakthrough mission.&lt;/p&gt;" />
