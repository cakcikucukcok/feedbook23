  <title>Mean Business: How I Save Bad Companies and Make Good Companies Great - Albert J. Dunlap, Bob Andelman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Al Dunlap is an original: an outspoken, irascible executive with an incredible track record of injecting new life into tired companies. The business media have coined a new verb&amp;ndash;&amp;ldquo;to dunlap&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;when describing a fast company turnaround. In April 1994 he became CEO and chairman of Scott Paper, which had lost $277 million in 1993, was on credit watch for excessive debt, and whose stock had been comatose for seven years. In a mere nineteen months, Scott had record earnings, the stock had increased in value by $6.5 billion (over 200 percent), and Dunlap merged Scott with Kimberly-Clark in a stock swap that valued Scott at $9 billion and created the second largest consumer-products company in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mean Business&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;combines Dunlap&amp;rsquo;s colorful personal history&amp;ndash;his working-class background, employment, friendship with such people as Sir James Goldsmith and George Soros, his views on why too many executives think of themselves as corporate royalty&amp;ndash;and his provocative ideas on management and leadership.
