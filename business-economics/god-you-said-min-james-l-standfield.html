  <title>God, You Said... - Min. James L. Standfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THIS BOOK IS A MUST READ FOR EVERY CHRISTIAN BUSINESS OWNER
God has called you for such a time as this!
In this powerful book, Min. James L. Standfield, The Authority On Biblical Entrepreneurship gives the Christian Entrepreneur the scriptures they need for Entrepreneurial Success.
I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem;
They shall never hold their peace day or night.
You who make mention of the LORD,
do not keep silent,
And give Him no rest till He establishes.
Isaiah 62:6-7
The Hebrew word for make mention is zakar and means to remember, to remind, to cause to remember. You who make mention of the LORD are literally the Lords remembrancers. Their job is to remind Him relentlessly of His word until He has established what He has promised. God has a wonderful memory, but He is not one bit offended by His people reminding Him of those things He has spoken. How long are we to remind God of His promises? He tells His watchmen to give Him no rest until He establishes what He has promised. This calls for faith, patience and persistence. The Christian Entrepreneur is not to give up on reminding God of His Word until they see all the things He has promised to establish in their business." />
