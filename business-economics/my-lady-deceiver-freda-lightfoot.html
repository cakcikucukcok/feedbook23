  <title>My Lady Deceiver - Freda Lightfoot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;1905. Rosie Belsfield feels as if her life has ended when she is rejected from Ellis Island and put on the next boat back to England, leaving her family behind. But fate gives her a second chance when she befriends Lady Rosalind, a pregnant widow on her way to the home of her late husband&amp;amp;#8217;s father, the wealthy Sir Ralph Tregowan. Having boarded the ship with one identity, fate decrees that Rosie leave it with another . . .&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As Rosie arrives in Cornwall as &amp;amp;#145;Rosalind&amp;amp;#8217;, she must fend for herself amongst a new and bitterly resentful family. Rosie becomes increasingly trapped by her deception and the cruelty of those around her &amp;amp;#150; the only light at the end of the tunnel seems to be the enigmatic Bryce Tregowan. With him the promise of a new life beckons, one of riches and even a title in beautiful Cornwall, but it is also one fraught with danger should her deceit be discovered.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;As she falls deeper into love and lies, can Rosie keep up the act, or will her secrets reveal themselves? And to what consequences?&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
