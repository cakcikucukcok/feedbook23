  <title>Never Lose Again - Steven Babitsky, Jr. James J. Mangraviti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Most Practical Book on Negotiating Ever Written&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Negotiating is an art. It&#39;s complicated. To become an exceptional negotiator traditionally requires years of experience in negotiations. But that doesn&#39;t mean that most people can&#39;t quickly and easily learn proven negotiating skill and techniques if someone shows them what to do. This book does exactly that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Never Lose Again&lt;/i&gt; reveals a simple but remarkably effective set of fifty questions that anyone can immediately use to become far better negotiators. The fifty questions apply to all types of negotiation situations, from conflicts like buying a home or car to business transactions of all kinds. Each question has been designed to put you in the best position possible, helping you to avoid tricks, break deadlocks, discover conflict and dispute resolutions, and find hidden deals in all types of negotiations.&lt;br&gt;No other book on the market distills the key negotiation principles into such a simply, effective, and instantly usable form. By learning to use these questions, you can start thinking like expert negotiators and make better deals for yourself, your family, and your business.&lt;/p&gt;" />
