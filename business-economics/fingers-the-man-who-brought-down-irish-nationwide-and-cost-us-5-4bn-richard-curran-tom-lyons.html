  <title>Fingers: The Man Who Brought Down Irish Nationwide and Cost Us €5.4bn - Richard Curran, Tom Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael Fingleton was an Irish banking legend, the ultimate big money lender. He took Irish Nationwide Building Society from an obscure mortgage provider to a multi-billion euro property-lending casino, leaving the taxpayer to pick up the tab for €5.4 billion when the society eventually went bust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fingleton earned over €2 million per year and built up a pension fund worth €27 million.
