  <title>Discussions About Leadership - ?efika ?ule Erçetin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Arab Spring movement shows that people in the Middle East and elsewhere want leaders who are more flexible, coherent and transparent.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This collection of essays explores the concept of leadership and proposes ways to learn to be a great leader and avoid the mistakes of the past in this academic work. Edited by Sefika Sule Eretin, one of the leading thinkers in Turkey, it offers insights on leadership from numerous contributors. The essays consider the characteristics of exceptional leaders, the traits that prevent leaders from succeeding, predictions about how leadership will change in the future, and inherent differences between leaders and followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These essays also detail the differences between management and leadership and examine the debate on whether managers can consistently be great leaders. Some say leaders possess innate qualities, but there is also evidence to suggest that anyone can hone their skills to become a successful leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In coming years, leadership on the political stage and other areas will be more critical than ever. Regardless of whether you are a CEO, middle-level executive, aspiring leader, or student, it is critical to hone your skills through &lt;i&gt;Discussions about Leadership&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
