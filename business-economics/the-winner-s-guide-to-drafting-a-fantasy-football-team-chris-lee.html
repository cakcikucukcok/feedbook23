&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial&quot;&gt;Anyone who has ever tried to find a definitive way to rank players for their fantasy draft or worse, find dollar values for auction-style leagues - knows the difficulty of finding a system that works for their leagues. Because leagues vary according to size, rules, and scoring systems, a player who may be a valuable commodity in one league may be below average in another. Therefore, the &quot;one size fits all&quot; rankings or valuations that you see most places can be useless. And even if those rankings were designed specifically for leagues like yours, values and rankings are normally assigned in a subjective manner, without any mathematical evidence to support the author&#39;s case.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

This proven system has helped Chris win many leagues. By following the steps in this book, you can build a spreadsheet that will help you win yours as well..&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
