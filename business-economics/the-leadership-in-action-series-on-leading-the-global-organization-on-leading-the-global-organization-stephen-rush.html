  <title>The Leadership in Action Series: On Leading the Global Organization: On Leading the Global Organization - Stephen Rush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Organizations that have operations around the globe have become the norm rather than the exception. This means they need leaders with the requisite skills-including international business knowledge, cultural adaptability, perspective taking, and innovation-to respond effectively to the challenges and complexity of global leadership. This collection of seventeen pieces-written by the Center for Creative Leadership&#39;s highly experienced and knowledgeable faculty members and researchers as well as by prominent practitioners and scholars in the fields of leadership and leadership development-explores the important topic of leading the global organization from a number of angles. What can organizations and leaders do to develop the skills needed to excel in a global context? How can global leaders manage the relationship between corporate headquarters and local offices? How can organizations best handle the challenge of boundary-spanning leadership? Readers will come away with newly found knowledge on these and other questions and newly formed thoughts on how they can successfully meet the demands of leading the global organization." />
