    	<p> Debbi is an independent 51 year young mother of two grown sons whose lifestyle was a richly woven tapestry of creative interests and activities. She cherished her great array of friends and enjoyed the past six years of weekends with a man she adored.</p><p> Life was perfect, until one day in a bizarre twist of fate, her boyfriend, her life partner very suddenly left her. While her devastation was earth shattering, her strength and fierce determination reset her compass to move forward. After a few months of mourning, then refocusing, and with support from her family, friends and an amazing therapist, Debbi found the courage to take a stab at internet dating again, but had no idea that one click of her mouse would have such far reaching karmic effects that would change her life forever.</p><p> This is the true story of two 50-something souls who were trying to find their way, and on the way, found each other. Theirs is the kind of love we all dreamt of in our youth and would never expect it to grace our hearts after weve experienced mid-life crisis. Just when Debbi reached an age when she thought she figured it all out life, love and the workings of her entire universe, she meets someone who shakes up her life and the universe she thought she knew so well. If it happened to you, would you still believe in love at first sight, or that a love can transcend any obstacle including death? Can the depth of that love permeate your soul so deeply and completely, that against any and all odds you could live a lifetime together in seven weeks? Well this is Debbis story. It <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">is</i></b> possible, because it happened, its real and its all true.</p>
