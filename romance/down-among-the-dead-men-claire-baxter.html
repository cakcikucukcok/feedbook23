  <title>Down Among the Dead Men - Claire Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Caitlyn needs to find her estranged father or her mother will be thrown out of the home she &lt;br&gt;loves, so Caitlyn ventures into the rough, tough world of the Australian opal fields. After &lt;br&gt;rescuing a teenager from an attempted assault she learns that the girl, Max, is her half-sister. &lt;br&gt;Their father is missing and suspected of stealing opals - an activity that could place both Max &lt;br&gt;and Caitlyn in danger. Attempting to locate their father without alerting the police, Caitlyn &lt;br&gt;enlists the help of Dale, a city lawyer turned lapidary, hiding out in the town to protect his &lt;br&gt;daughter from death threats. Together they investigate, but progress is slow until Caitlyn &lt;br&gt;stumbles upon a link between her father and organised crime, and into an investigation by the &lt;br&gt;Federal Police.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After offering herself as the go-between in a &#39;sting&#39;, Caitlyn realises that she&#39;s put Dale&#39;s life &lt;br&gt;at risk and in order to save him, she does the one thing she&#39;s sworn never to do. She battles &lt;br&gt;crippling claustrophobia to descend into the darkness of an underground opal mine where her &lt;br&gt;father&#39;s dead body is lying. With the criminals either arrested or dead, Caitlyn accepts that &lt;br&gt;she&#39;s found more than she went looking for. She&#39;s fallen in love with Dale, but there&#39;s no &lt;br&gt;way he&#39;d consider moving back to the city, not when a move would expose his daughter to &lt;br&gt;danger. He doesn&#39;t ask her to stay so she makes a new life for herself and her sister in &lt;br&gt;Adelaide...until the death of the man threatening his family allows Dale to confess his &lt;br&gt;feelings for her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
