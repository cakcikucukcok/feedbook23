      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love is a battlefield...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Superhero Vince &quot;The Anvil&quot; can take on knives, bullets, and bombs, but he&#39;s not invincible. It was a hard hit when Kara, AKA &quot;Snapdragon,&quot; flew off after their explosive affair. And he&#39;s especially vulnerable when she returns, looking for his help. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kara is new to the superhero game, and villain TechHead is too much for her and her teammates to handle. He&#39;s determined to use their combined power to fuel his ultimate weapon. Her only chance to take him on is with Vince&#39;s brutal skill. But bringing Vince into the fight leaves her exposed to the white hot passion that had scared her away in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When TechHead captures Kara, Vince will stop at nothing to rescue her-even if it means sacrificing his heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ironheart was previously released as part of the Holding Out for a Hero anthology.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
