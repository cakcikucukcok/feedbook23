  <title>Heart Lock: Embrace of Two Souls - Kym Datura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He turned the warlock around and looked him straight in the eyes as the warlock began to bleed to death. &quot;You suffered unto my wife and child and now you must pay the price.&quot; The warlock looked into Nico&#39;s eyes pleadingly.    &quot;Argh... glugg..&quot; The warlock tried to speak, but couldn&#39;t. He knew he was powerless after being cut by a witch&#39;s athame that was thousands time more powerful then he could ever hope or imagine to be.    As the warlock tried to speak, Nico opened the warlock&#39;s mouth, pulled out his tongue and sliced it off. Not only was blood spurting from the warlock&#39;s mouth, his throat was bleeding profusely. Nico held up the warlock by his shoulders and watched him die as he stared him in the eyes.    &quot;As your life is drained from you, may you feel the agony and pain you bestowed upon my wife Bella, ten-fold. May your soul be damned to hell for all eternity.&quot; Were the last words the warlock heard come from Nico&#39;s mouth as his life drained from his now lifeless body." />
