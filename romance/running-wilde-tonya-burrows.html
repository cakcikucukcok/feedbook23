  <title>Running Wilde - Tonya Burrows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lark Warren can never stay one person for too long, so when her past starts to catch up to her, she hops the first bus out of DC, steals a new name, and goes deep into hiding in New Orleans. Unfortunately, all it takes is the wrong set of eyes to blow her cover. Enter Vaughn--the man she once let get too close to her real self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ex-Navy SEAL Vaughn Wilde has one objective: drive Lark back to DC to face charges for identity theft--which would be easier if he could forget the three lust-filled weeks he shared with her before she disappeared. With each passing mile, he can&#39;t ignore the heat still sparking between them...or the fact he has led her enemies right to her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lark can&#39;t stay with Vaughn, not when it will put him in the crosshairs of the dangerous man she&#39;s spent the last five years running from. But Vaughn is determined to keep her safe--even if it means she&#39;ll run off with his heart all over again.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Wilde Security series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt; Series Order:&lt;br&gt; Book #1 Wilde Nights in Paradise &lt;br&gt; Book #2 Wilde for Her&lt;br&gt; Book #3 Wilde at Heart&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Running Wilde&lt;br&gt;Book #5 Too Wilde to Tame&lt;/p&gt;" />
