  <title>The Berserker&#39;s Rage (Orc MM/Human F Fantasy Erotica) - Jenna Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the Lich King is incapacitated, the Horde falters. Leila and Aewyn band together a group of survivors and head back to their home to the fallen kingdom of Erun. As Robyn and Grace depart for their own mission, Rick and Kara join in their stead. Both are human survivors of the vicious Horde attack. When the survivors cross the seas and land upon the lands to the East, they encounter the remnants of the Horde.
Rick decides to stall for time so that the others can run, but it is of no use as a group of Orcs ambush Leila&#39;s group. When Rick finds Leila and Aewyn, he learns that Kara and several others have been taken by the Orcs. Leila is highly suspicious of Rick after he survives against insurmountable odds.
He reveals that he has the ability to become a beast, a Berserker, able to unleash a rage that even Orcs cannot hold back. Leila, Aewyn, Rick and a group of survivors find the Orcs and descend upon them. But while they were looking for the Orcs, was Kara able to fend for herself?" />
