  <title>I&#39;m No Angel - I&#39;m No Saint, I&#39;m Just a Man - S. L. Sharp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;IM NO ANGEL  IM NO SAINT, IM JUST A MAN, explores the expansive caverns under the four-mile Atlantic City Boardwalk which provide housing for hundreds of the poor and downtrodden people including Christopher, a grey bearded, long haired, unkempt middle age man. He possesses godly connections and remarkable powers to assist fellow unfortunate acquaintances, friends from the boardwalk, casino visitors and residents of the Atlantic City.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the roller coaster ride with Christopher in the pages ahead while he unselfishly serves as the citys unofficial guardian. The action filled book reveals Christophers amazing relationship with a seagull named Sanabrio who is his confidant, regarding issues with the battered women, criminals, HIV challenged, desperate gamblers, the mentally challenged, and impoverished children. Christopher is a believer that all godly creatures are placed on earth for a special purpose and devotes his life to the development of their unfulfilled potential using his special powers.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Christophers life of scorn by casino security personnel and devotion to servicing challenged humans takes an unexpected turn with the meeting of Lady Noreen, an attractive, affluent middle age woman suffering from depression. Christopher cleans up his act in the grooming department and moves to Lady Noreens magnificent Oceanside home in Ventnor. Their relationship quickly blossoms into a remarkable love story and brings purpose to their lives. They form an unlikely partnership committed to the enrichment of Atlantic City. And under their stewardship, the Atlantic City Boardwalk evolves into a year round 7/24 entertainment center featuring dancers, singers, and musicians at charity events, competitions, celebrity events, fashion shows, fireworks, and marathons. The charity coffers quickly overflow with financial resources for healthcare, education and enrichment programs for battered women, children, teenagers, and the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
