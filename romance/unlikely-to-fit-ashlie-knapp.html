  <title>Unlikely to Fit - Ashlie Knapp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Breckin Henderson returned to her hometown of Parker, Oklahoma, she didn’t expect her football coaching husband to leave her for the head cheerleader as soon as she walked across the graduation stage. Never one to run, Breckin remained in Parker, but picking up the pieces of her shattered life proves more difficult than she could ever imagine.
For residents of Parker, Griff was the man who came home with a broken heart when the love of his life was killed in a tragic motorcycle accident. The grandson who drives his eighty-nine year old grandmother grocery shopping each week. The bartender who took over the bar his grandfather owned and subsequently took his grandfather’s place listening to the town’s troubles.
Both Breckin and Griff’s hearts have been broken once before. As they grow closer, will they be able to put their fears and insecurities aside and try to discover love again? Or will their hearts be too broken to ever completely mend?" />
