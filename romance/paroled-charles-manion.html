  <title>Paroled - Charles Manion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Stewart Vogel is paroled in August of 1983, after spending twenty-five years in the Eddyville Prison in Kentucky, he is mildly surprised, but grateful, for his freedom. Though serving a life sentence for committing a homicide during a felony, Vogel has always maintained his innocence and has been a model prisoner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fast-moving novel, full of new turns at every corner, we follow the adventures of newly-paroled Stu. As an ex-Marine who served in the Korean War, Stu leaves prison with three hundred dollars and a modest trust fund, established by his mother. His dreams are to see his sister and her two children, do some boating, and visit a loyal friend in Florida.
Within weeks of being paroled, Stu enjoys what may seem like a Tom Sawyer adventure, down the Mississippi River, never knowing that someone wants him returned to prison.&lt;/p&gt;" />
