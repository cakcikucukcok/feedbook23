          &lt;strong&gt;THE CAPTIVE BRIDE &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She Would Not Be A Bride! Lady Katharine believed that men and marriage were nothing more than paths to lifelong servitude. And Lord Senet, having stolen her home, seemed no exception. Yet though his touch made her feel beautiful and feminine, how could she ever care for a man she could not trust?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lord Senet Gaillard was an honorable knight. Had there been another path to reclaiming his ancestral castle other than wedding Lady Katharine, he would have taken it. But the deed was done, and now he must woo his reluctant bride - for winning her heart had become more important than life itself.&lt;/p&gt;
