          &lt;strong&gt;She&#39;d found him–her missing husband…and the father of her child&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only, Dr. Hugh Menton didn&#39;t remember anything about Meg Avery or their marriage. Hugh couldn&#39;t recall the man he&#39;d been before his accident. Still, he couldn&#39;t deny the fact that the little girl with eyes like his own brought out all his paternal instincts. Or the thrill of desire that overcame him whenever he was near Meg.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meg didn&#39;t know what had changed Hugh so. But she knew she loved him…needed him…. And she&#39;d do everything possible to convince him that they would never be complete until they were a family once again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;American Baby: Unexpected arrivals lead to the sweetest of surprises as Harlequin American Romance celebrates the love only a baby can bring!&lt;/strong&gt;
