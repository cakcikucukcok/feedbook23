  <title>The Legendary Lord - Valerie Bowman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bestselling author Valerie Bowman sets the stage in Regency England for her Playful Brides series, where couples&#39; misadventures on the way to the altar are witty, romantic romps based on some of the world&#39;s most beloved plays. The sixth charming entry, &lt;i&gt;The Legendary Lord&lt;/i&gt;, is inspired by George Bernard Shaw&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Pygmalion&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE MAKING OF A LEGEND...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Christian Forester, Viscount Berkeley, flees the stuffy ballrooms of London for his Scottish hunting lodge, the last thing he expects to find ensconced before his fire is an incredibly beautiful woman. But the plight of lovely young Sarah Highgate, who has run away from an unwanted betrothal, inspires an eminently practical exchange. He&#39;ll safeguard her reputation with the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt; while she advises him how to best attract a proper bride... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the undisputed belle of the season, Sarah has enchanted plenty of suitors. Still, she isn&#39;t interested in marriage, especially not to the pompous bore her father has chosen for her. But her hasty escape seems reckless now that she&#39;s estranged from her family and has no one to count on besides Christian. Turning the lucklesslord into such a catch has another unplanned consequence for Sarah: Has he run away with her heart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Legendary Lord &lt;/i&gt;is the sixth installment of Valerie Bowman&#39;s Regency-set Playful Brides series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
