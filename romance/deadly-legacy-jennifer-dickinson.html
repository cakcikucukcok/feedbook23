  <title>Deadly Legacy - Jennifer Dickinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meghan Delaney, a young medical student, while on vacation at a mountain chalet, falls in love with a handsome man whose intentions may not be what they seem.  Declan Montgomery, the son of a Senator and an emerging actor recognizes Meghan immediately as the third member of the triad and sets out to possess her.  However, neither one can foresee the deadly consequences of their relationship and the lengths Liam O&#39;Brien will go to ensure that they do not fulfill the prophecy.  Meghan&#39;s life is thrown into chaos and everything she believed about her family and herself is shattered.  Ireland holds the answers to her families past, but can she find the truth in time before everyone she knows is killed.  Her journey takes her to her ancestral home on the west coast of Ireland and what she finds there will change everyone&#39;s lives forever.  As Liam and Declan battle over the events of the past and the possibilities of the future, the only thing that can stop the bloodshed is Meghan and her love for Declan." />
