  <title>Tattoo: Spicy Bites 2017 RWA Short Story Anthology - Romance Writers of Australia Authors, Gates Sarah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a secret life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever done something you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally dare to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever received something you hadn&amp;rsquo;t bargained for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join us for Romance Writers of Australia&amp;rsquo;s newest anthology offering, Spicy Bites. Only the steamiest of stories have made it through to the 2017 edition where passion and pleasure walk hand-in-hand during the daylight hours but fetish and fantasy linger long into the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a different kind of buzz for the &lt;em&gt;Tattoo&lt;/em&gt; edition. You&amp;rsquo;ll meet women respectable in the boardroom and just plain naughty outside of it, her ink for his eyes only. Fantasies you can&amp;rsquo;t even mention to your closest friends are unleashed online but you&amp;rsquo;ve saved the starring role just for him. Freedom is bartered and bought and even the pleasure bots are branded in this collection of erotic tales guaranteed to satisfy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour yourself a glass of wine, run a hot bath and lay back for what promises to be a hell of a ride&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inaugural Spicy Bites Short Story competition has been a highlight of the 2017 RWA contest year offering those at the hotter end of the passion scale a chance to showcase their talent. Competition to be included in the anthology is fierce resulting in a very fine selection of erotic stories from all romance subgenres. Judging is rigorous with each entry read by three judges and scored for writing technique, character development and the elusive X Factor. The stories must include the current year&amp;rsquo;s theme, Tattoo for 2017, be under 5000 words and rated from steamy all the way to explicit sexual content. Our judges never cease to be amazed and delighted by the creativity and variety of entries within those guidelines.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; You won&amp;rsquo;t be able to stop at just one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
