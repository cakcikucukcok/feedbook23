This is the story of Gebashe, who, as a school boy, was recruited by the organization of freedom fighters and ended up in Swaziland as a private doctor with an unhappy marriage. Back home Gebashes father is estranged from his eldest son, who took Gebashe from a rural school to a school in Cape Town from where he was recruited by the freedom fighters. Gebashes return to his home country, long after the first elections for a democratic government marks the beginning of reconciliation in his family, acted out through the custom of initiation. He then remarries; this time to a woman who would have been his childhood girlfriend had things been normal when they grew up. It is a story of mutilated family structures, but through all that hope for reconciliation and prosperity prevails, hence the title." />
