          &lt;strong&gt;Make-Believe Marriage&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When newborn twins are dropped on Charles Wanlass&#39;s doorstep – along with a note begging him to protect them – he knows he needs help to give them a proper home. The only solution: entering a marriage of convenience with mail-order bride Willow Granger. But soon the handsome pastor longs for their make-believe family to become real…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Willow will do whatever it takes to keep her missing friend&#39;s babies safe. She&#39;s drawn to Charles&#39;s steadfast caring and honesty, but she&#39;s sure she doesn&#39;t have the proper background or courage to ever be a worthy wife or mother. But as danger closes in, she and Charles will risk everything to face down their fears – and turn their temporary home into a lifetime of love.&lt;/p&gt;
