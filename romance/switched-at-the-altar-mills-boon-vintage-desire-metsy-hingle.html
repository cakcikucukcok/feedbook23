          &lt;strong&gt;Right Bride, WRONG GROOM STOP THE WEDDING! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maybe his brother was easily swayed by the wiles of a Southern vamp, but not steely Alex Stone. He had managed to tiptoe around the commitment trap. But from all appearances his younger sibling was newly engaged to sultry Desiree Mason, and Alex was sure she was just another heat-seeking marriage missile aimed at the family wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Alex knew that the surest way to keep his brother out of the bridal suite was to lure this honey-voiced vixen into his bed. But &quot;saving&quot; his sibling could mean losing himself to love… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;RIGHT BRIDE, WRONG GROOM: &lt;em&gt;Marrying Mr. Almost-Right is all wrong, especially when the perfect man is ready to sweep you into his arms!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
