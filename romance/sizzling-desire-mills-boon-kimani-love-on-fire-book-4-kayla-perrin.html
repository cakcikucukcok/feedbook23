  <title>Sizzling Desire (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (Love on Fire, Book 4) - Kayla Perrin</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A combustible attraction…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Flirting with a gorgeous stranger at the bar is how Lorraine Mitchell celebrates her longed for newly single status. One-night stands usually run hot and wild before quickly flaming out, but Lorraine cannot forget her heated encounter with firefighter Hunter Holland. Weeks later, she is beyond surprised to discover that his father—a former patient of hers—has left her a large bequest!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Last time Hunter was in the same room as Lorraine, they were burning up the sheets. Now he’s staring at her from across a lawyer’s office. At first, guilt and grief convince him that the beautiful nurse took advantage of his long-estranged father. Yet despite mutual mistrust, he knows this kind of chemistry only comes around once in a lifetime. And reviving their spark just might ignite a love that’s as deep and true as it is scorching…&lt;/p&gt;
