  <title>Behind The Mask - Metsy Hingle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;&quot;I&#39;ll pay you one million dollars to find my wife and son.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ex-cop turned bounty hunter Michael Sullivan doesn&#39;t think any woman is worth that kind of money, but a job is a job.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;All he has to do is make the phone call…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just drop in the quarter and tell his client he&#39;s earned his money. Lily Webster and her son are in New Orleans, where she&#39;s working as a waitress. One phone call and he can collect a cool million bucks…and forget the beautiful woman who seems to be hiding something.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Too late, he realizes he&#39;s made a mistake…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Only after he&#39;s made the call does he begin to realize what he&#39;s done. In the blink of an eye Michael Sullivan becomes Lily&#39;s only chance for survival. Now all he has to do is convince her to trust him. But why would she put her life–and the life of her son–in the hands of the man who betrayed her?&lt;/p&gt;
