  <title>The Millionaire&#39;s Revenge Contract - Sonya Weiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maddie Russell is a mile past desperate. She&#39;s newly fired, broke, and needs money to help her still-healing sister. Her plan is to beg for her job back--until she realizes millionaire Cole Mitchell, the man who was once the bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks, is the one responsible for taking everything her family owned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now she has a new plan. One that&#39;s sure to please them both...and quench the fire that still burns between them. In exchange for his help, she&#39;ll become his mistress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cole doesn&#39;t trust the Russell family, least of all Maddie. When he was a teenager, her grandfather framed him for a crime he didn&#39;t commit. The only thing he wants from her is his revenge. But the spark between them won&#39;t be denied. As their lives tangle together, Cole quickly discovers falling for the enemy will cost him more than he imagined. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because revenge demands its own price...&lt;/p&gt;" />
