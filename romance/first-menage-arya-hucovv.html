  <title>First Menage - Arya Hucovv</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anna Kylie is a smart, pretty, third-year-student in Sociology. She is a perfectly ordinary young woman with a perfectly ordinary life... except for that part where she&amp;#39;s willingly entered an arrangement to carry a child for Aiden and Hamilton, two Alpha Werewolves. The arrangement promises to be straightforward and simple.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is, of course, anything but.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you two married?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aiden smiles while Hamilton looks slightly disgusted she would even think that. &amp;quot;No. We&amp;#39;re part of the same pack. I understand the confusion, however. The site requires a picture of a couple.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And you&amp;#39;re both looking for surrogates, or just one of you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;In a way, both,&amp;quot; Aiden answers. &amp;quot;We share the position of pack leader in our pack, so things are a little complicated for now. Thankfully, due to our shared DNA, it would not matter either way which one of us impregnates you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Twins,&amp;quot; she says, the pieces clicking together. It explains why they look so similar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Identical twins,&amp;quot; Hamilton says, which surprises her. There are enough differences in the men&amp;#39;s faces to allow her to tell them apart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s a pause as she tries to think of another question. It doesn&amp;#39;t take her long. &amp;quot;Why are you looking to have children since neither of you are mated?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again, Aiden is the one to answer. &amp;quot;We aren&amp;#39;t getting any younger.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; she says, accepting the answer easily. They have urges, same as hers. Only, their urge to procreate is twenty years later. &amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s going to be the father?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We both are,&amp;quot; Aiden says. &amp;quot;We will share custody of the baby, as we&amp;#39;ve shared custody of everything else we own.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not everything,&amp;quot; Hamilton says. &amp;quot;We have our own lives, Aiden. We just share the pack.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The pack, the house, and our future child.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hamilton does not seem to be happy with the co-dependency that Aiden seems to be cultivating for each other. Anna doesn&amp;#39;t know what to think. It&amp;#39;s such a peculiar arrangement. Perhaps she should find other candidates, other couples that aren&amp;#39;t so complicated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot; she asks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both men turn to her at once. &amp;quot;Why what?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why do this? Why not have two surrogates and two children. You seem to share so much already. Perhaps it would be best if you didn&amp;#39;t share this too?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aiden frowns, like the thought has never crossed his mind before. Hamilton looks pleased by her suggestion. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a good idea, Aiden. Perhaps you should look for another hucow.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I found this one. You can look for your own,&amp;quot; is the brother&amp;#39;s immediate response.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The two men proceed to glare daggers at each other, growling in that feral manner she&amp;#39;s only seen Alphas do in soap operas. Anna&amp;#39;s sorry she&amp;#39;s opened her mouth and suggested anything at all." />
