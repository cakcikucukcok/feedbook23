  <title>Secrets in the Shadows - Jenna Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vampires&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They hunt in every major city, hidden by the crowds, shielded by disbelief. They are Killers, and their prey is human.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; vampires are Killers. The Guardians of the Night sacrifice the superior physical and psychic strength that comes with feeding on humans to protect them.  But the Guardians walk a thin line, for even a single kill could leave them helplessly addicted to murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jules Gerard has vowed that he will never become a Killer.  But when he discovers that the man who turned him into a vampire is dead and kicking in Baltimore, the allure of extra power is tempting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing in his way is a human, spitfire Hannah Moore, who has followed him to Baltimore to help him confront his past. Hannah doesn&#39;t seem to realize how dangerous vampires can be--and despite his façade of disdain, Jules has a real soft spot for the petite P.I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jules is going to have to choose: vengeance or love? Damnation or redemption?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
