And when he learns that Mariel&#39;s father conspires with the Sheriff of Nottingham Robert is compelled to protect her. Even if it means lying. Even if it means the only way he can save her is by marrying her. He&#39;s willing to lose everything to guard the Scottish wildling who has pierced his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Ladies of Scotland series is a STANDALONE story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Books in the series&lt;br&gt;An Earl for the Archeress&lt;br&gt;The Maiden&#39;s Defender&lt;/p&gt;" />
