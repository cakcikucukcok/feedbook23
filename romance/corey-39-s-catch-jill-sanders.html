  <title>Corey&#39;s Catch - Jill Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Corey has dug himself into a hole so deep, he can&amp;rsquo;t see a way out. His only goal now is to see this rough patch through. But then Bella waltzes into his life and knocks him on his ass&amp;mdash;figuratively and literally. Now, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing he wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do to prove to her that his wild days are a thing of the past. But he just might need some of his rebellious ways if he wants to keep what he&amp;rsquo;s finally found.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Bella isn&amp;rsquo;t sure why she&amp;rsquo;s chosen to stay in the small town of Fairplay, Texas, after her aunt&amp;rsquo;s funeral. But she&amp;rsquo;s never been one to back out of a situation. And after running into one of the sexiest and most headstrong cowboys she&amp;rsquo;s ever met, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t plan to start now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
