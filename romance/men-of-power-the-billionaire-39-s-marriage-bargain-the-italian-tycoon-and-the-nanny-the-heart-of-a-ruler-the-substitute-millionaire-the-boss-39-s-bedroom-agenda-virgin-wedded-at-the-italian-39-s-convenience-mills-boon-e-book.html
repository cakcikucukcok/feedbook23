          &lt;strong&gt;Six ruthless, powerful men and the women they love in this thrilling new collection from M&amp;B.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Billionaire’s Marriage Bargain &lt;/em&gt; by Carole Mortimer&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No one makes a fool of Dominick Masters. When estranged wife Kenzie returns, asking for his help, he’s determined to exact a most pleasurable revenge. Yet a temporary arrangement isn&#39;t really this billionaire&#39;s style—his demand: a more permanent deal from his wife!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Italian Tycoon and the Nanny &lt;/em&gt; by Rebecca Winters&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A new daddy to his orphaned nephew, Massimo di Rocche needs help. Bringing the baby&#39;s beautiful aunt Julie Marchant to Italy as a nanny seems the perfect solution. Quiet Julie may be out of place in his glamorous world—but now Massimo can’t imagine life without her!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Heart of a Ruler&lt;/em&gt; by Marie Ferrarella&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lord Russell, Duke of Carrington, has always put duty before everything. Being a wayward prince’s right-hand man was already difficult enough…until he fell for the prince’s betrothed, Princess Amelia. Could Russell betray his country and future king for love?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Substitute Millionaire &lt;/em&gt; by Susan Mallery&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Successful businessman Ryan Bennett had agreed to masquerade as his wealthy cousin for a blind date…but he didn’t expect just how captivating Julie Nelson would be. Confessing his deception put an end to their passionate night—but now Julie is expecting her enemy’s baby!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Boss’s Bedroom Agenda &lt;/em&gt; by Nicola Marsh&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CEO Aidan Voss has one rule: keep his personal life out of the office! But when Beth Walker walks in, he decides to make an exception. Aidan may not be able to offer her any more than a fling, but this master of seduction has moved Beth to the top of his to-do list….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin: Wedded at the Italian’s Convenience&lt;/em&gt; by Diane Hamilton&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Arrogant Italian Paolo Venini needs to marry. And English rose Lily Frome will make a perfect, convenient wife. But Paolo expects more than just a marriage in name only—after their vows have been exchanged, Paolo intends to claim his virgin bride as his own….&lt;/p&gt;
