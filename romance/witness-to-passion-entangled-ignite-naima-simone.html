  <title>Witness to Passion (Entangled Ignite) - Naima Simone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Under his protection and in his bed...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Fallon Wayland, birthdays are just another reminder of her looming spinsterhood. This year is shaping up to be no different. Fired from her job, dumped by her boyfriend, and oh yes, witnessing the murder of a high-ranking lieutenant in the local crime family... Yeah, birthdays suck.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ever since a disastrous, hot-as-hell kiss years ago, soldier-turned-security specialist Shane Roarke has avoided his baby sister&#39;s reckless - and gorgeous - best friend. Yet when her life is threatened after she witnesses a gang hit, he insists on protecting her...even if she objects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two are forced to hole up in a safe house. Alone. Passion long denied erupts between them, burning away their inhibitions. But even as layers - and clothes - are peeled away, danger closes in. Shane and Fallon might finally have a chance at love...if they survive long enough to see it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
