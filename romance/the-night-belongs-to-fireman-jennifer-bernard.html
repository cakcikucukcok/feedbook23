  <title>The Night Belongs to Fireman - Jennifer Bernard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daring . . . Sexy . . . Irresistible . . . &lt;br /&gt;They&#39;re the Bachelor Firemen of San Gabriel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When fireman Fred Breen rescues a bachelorette party after a construction crane collapses onto their limo, the media labels him the &quot;Bachelor Hero.&quot; But all Fred can think about is the petite brunette with the sexy mane of dark curls who bolted away from him faster than a wildfire after he carried her to safety. And when he discovers she&#39;s none other than Rachel Kessler, the daughter of a tech billionaire, the girl whose kidnapping riveted the nation, he intends to learn every intimate detail about this intriguing woman who sets his pulse on fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rachel can&#39;t deny the lean-muscled firefighter is smokin&#39; hot. But after having one too many drinks at the bar where she first meets him, Rachel knows she&#39;s made a fool of herself. Yet when he rescues her from the limo, she feels safe for the first time since she was held for ransom as a child. Then her overprotective father insists Fred be her bodyguard&amp;#8212;and his close presence kindles a burning desire that only he can extinguish.&lt;/p&gt;" />
