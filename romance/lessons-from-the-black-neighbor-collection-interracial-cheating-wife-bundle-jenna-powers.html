  <title>Lessons from the Black Neighbor Collection (Interracial Cheating Wife Bundle) - Jenna Powers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Angela was once a quiet, bored wife looking for her husband&#39;s attention until one fateful day. She walked over to her black neighbor&#39;s house and met Malcolm. This intense bundle pulls together Lessons from the Black Neighbor 1, 2, and 3 into one incredible collection that features sizzling action. Watch Angela transform from a naive white wife to a chocolate craving student for her black man.
Lessons from the Black Neighbor
Angela is doing whatever she can to try to get her marriage back on the right track, especially when it comes to sex. The day after her husband falls asleep before they make love, she heads out to her friend Ebony. Unfortunately, Ebony has to head out but her husband, Malcolm is available to talk. As Angela lets out her frustrations, he decides to help teach her some new tricks... but for whom?
Angela takes quite the lesson from her black neighbor!
Lessons from the Black Neighbor 2
Angela tries what she learned from Malcolm, her big black neighbor, on her husband. Unfortunately for her, he doesn&#39;t have the same passion or fortitude. Angela decides to visit Malcolm again to see if she&#39;s doing something wrong. Malcolm, of course, is more than happy to give her another lesson... Can Angela handle Malcolm&#39;s new lesson or will it be too much this time?
Angela&#39;s second lesson is much more intense than her previous one!
Lessons from the Black Neighbor 3
Angela&#39;s back and tries to seduce her husband with some new lessons she&#39;s learned from her big black neighbor Malcolm. Her husband however, does not reciprocate, and ends up heading back to work. Malcolm miraculously shows up at her doorstep, looking for her husband. Angela decides enough is enough and takes the final lesson from Malcolm. But is she really ready for the final lesson?
Angela&#39;s third and final lesson is one that&#39;s going to push her over the edge!" />
