  <title>A Walk in the Rain - Udai Yadla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love is poison that kills you. Love is elixir that keeps you alive. An unreciprocated love keeps you alive, but kills every day. 
Heartbroken Sunny lives a reclusive life, trapped in the past, living in his memories. He has no complaints about his life, but refuses to embrace the present. 
Saloni is a prostitute who is desperate to earn money by any means. She does not care about exploiting others to fulfill her purpose. 
Fate unites the loner and the prostitute to embark on a life changing journey of retribution and self discovery. 
Lovelorn Sunny turns misogynistic after Sandy, the only girl he loved walks away from his life, unannounced. He suffers painful solitude for almost two decades with the relentless haunting of her thoughts. A distressed friend Imran, vows to change his life forever. A surprise planned for his birthday turns into a tragedy that claims the life of his dear friend, triggering a series of unbelievable events. As Imran gets killed by a stranger, Sunnys calm life suddenly turns into a turbulent storm. With nothing left to live for, vengeance becomes his ultimate mission. His reluctant alliance with a prostitute to trace the killer sets him onto a nerve racking adventure of life and death. 
Both are bound to a common goal with different motives, but destiny has its own motive. 
A walk in the rain is an intricate tale of intense emotions, driven by hair raising twists and turns." />
