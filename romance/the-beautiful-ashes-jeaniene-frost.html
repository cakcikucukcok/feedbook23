  <title>The Beautiful Ashes - Jeaniene Frost</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;In a world of shadows, anything is possible. Except escaping your fate.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever since she was a child, Ivy has been gripped by visions of strange realms just beyond her own. But when her sister goes missing, Ivy discovers the truth is far worse-her hallucinations are real, and her sister is trapped in a parallel realm. And the one person who believes her is the dangerously attractive guy who&#39;s bound by an ancient legacy to betray her. Adrian might have turned his back on those who raised him, but that doesn&#39;t mean he can change his fate… no matter how strong a pull he feels toward Ivy. Together they search for the powerful relic that can save her sister, but Adrian knows what Ivy doesn&#39;t: that every step brings Ivy closer to the truth about her own destiny, and a war that could doom the world.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sooner or later, it will be Ivy on one side and Adrian on the other. And nothing but ashes in between… .&lt;/p&gt;
