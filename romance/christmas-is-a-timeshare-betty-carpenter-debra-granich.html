  <title>Christmas is a Timeshare - Betty Carpenter, Debra Granich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jessie Bailey, an executive at a property management firm in Jacksonville Florida, loves her job, her church work, and her best friend Donnie Lee. But memories of a con man&amp;rsquo;s torment of her and her mother haunt her. She cherishes her independence, with no need for a romantic relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When David Alan arrives from the corporate office in Houston to investigate possible fraud in Jessie&amp;rsquo;s department, nothing prepares him for his initial reaction to the powerful and beautiful Jessie. Nor is he prepared for the temperature in the room to drop to &amp;ldquo;arctic&amp;rdquo; whenever they cross paths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one eventful morning, Jessie&amp;rsquo;s quiet life turns upside down with the arrival of the attractive interloper from Houston and two anonymous gifts left on her desk; gifts intended to let her know the con man from her past has been released from prison and is bent on revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Jessie has to clear her name and department of accusations, while keeping herself alive until her nemesis is behind bars again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to do it alone. Along the way she&amp;rsquo;ll find herself propped up by Donnie Lee, David Alan, her Red Hat mentor Dorothy Graylee, and most of all, her faith in her Lord.&lt;/p&gt;" />
