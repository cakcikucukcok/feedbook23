  <title>Rom-Com Collection (Part1): The Best Man / Somebody to Love / Catch of the Day / The Next Best Thing (Mills &amp; Boon e-Book Collections) - Kristan Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Kristan Higgins writes with warmth, verve and enthusiasm. Her books are funny and delightful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you love romantic comedies, you’ll love this four book collection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THE BEST MAN&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Faith Holland left her hometown after being jilted at the altar. Now a little older and wiser, she&#39;s ready to return to the Blue Heron Winery, her family&#39;s vineyard, to confront the ghosts of her past, and maybe enjoy a glass of red. After all, there&#39;s some great scenery there….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;SOMEBODY TO LOVE&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After her father loses the family fortune in an insider-trading scheme, single mom Parker Welles is faced with some hard decisions. First order of business: go to Gideon&#39;s Cove, Maine, to sell the only thing she now owns–a decrepit house in need of some serious flipping. When her father&#39;s wingman, James Cahill, asks to go with her, she&#39;s not thrilled…even if he is fairly gorgeous and knows his way around a toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;CATCH OF THE DAY&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maggie Beaumont&#39;s luck is about to change. Sure, she&#39;s known for her bad romantic choices—her former boyfriend broke up with her by bringing his new girlfriend home for a visit. And then there was the crush she had on a gorgeous young Irishman, who turned out to be Father Tim, the parish&#39;s new priest.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THE NEXT BEST THING&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lucy Lang isn&#39;t looking for fireworks…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;s looking for a nice, decent man. Someone who&#39;ll mow the lawn, flip chicken on the barbecue, teach their future children to play soccer. But most important: someone who won&#39;t inspire the slightest stirring in her heart…or anywhere else. A young widow, Lucy can&#39;t risk that kind of loss again. But sharing her life with a cat named Fat Mikey and the Black Widows at the family bakery isn&#39;t enough either. So it&#39;s goodbye to Ethan, her hot but entirely inappropriate &quot;friend with privileges,&quot; and hello to a man she can marry.&lt;/p&gt;
