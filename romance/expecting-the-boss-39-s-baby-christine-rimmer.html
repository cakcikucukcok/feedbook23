  <title>Expecting the Boss&#39;s Baby - Christine Rimmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#34;Sex is absolutely off the table.&amp;#34;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; was Dax Girard&#39;s hiring policy. Well, it might not be conventional&amp;#151;but then again, all admin-assist-wannabe Zoe Bravo wanted was a job. And her prospective boss, Dax Girard, was so gorgeous that he&#39;d clearly had to beat them off with a stick before. So she calmly agreed to the mogul&#39;s terms&amp;#151;even throwing in a fake fianc&amp;#233; for good measure! A strictly hands-off policy was fine with her&amp;#133;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But was it fine with &lt;em&gt;him?&lt;/em&gt; Because the more no-strings-attached Dax swore he was as immune to Zoe as he was to your average beautiful woman, the more he started envisioning a future that had her in it. And, in nine months, a little someone else, as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
