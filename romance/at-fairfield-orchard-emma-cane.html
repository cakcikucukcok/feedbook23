  <title>At Fairfield Orchard - Emma Cane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emma Cane welcomes you to Fairfield Orchard, where new love blooms and romance is always in season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Amy Fairfield, the family orchard is more than a business. With its blossom-scented air and rows of trees framed by the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, it&amp;#8217;s her heritage and her future. But right now, it&amp;#8217;s also a headache. Putting a painful breakup behind her, Amy has come home to help revitalize Fairfield Orchard. She doesn&amp;#8217;t have time for the handsome&amp;#8212;distracting&amp;#8212;professor who wants to dig into her family&amp;#8217;s history for his research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Gebhart knows he needs the Fairfields&amp;#8217; cooperation to make his new book a success. As for Amy&amp;#8212;nothing in his years of academia could have prepared him for their sudden and intense attraction. He doesn&amp;#8217;t want to complicate her life further, especially since she seems uneasy about his poking around in the past and he knows he&amp;#8217;s not the sort of man built for forever. But some sparks can&amp;#8217;t help but grow, and Jonathan and Amy may just learn that unexpected love can be the sweetest of all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
