  <title>The Trinity Knot - DonnaLee Overly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the emotional aftermath of sexual assault, can giving a voice to your feelings lead to forgiveness, or even love?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabriella King is a tremendously talented painter, who works in an art gallery. A tall, lithe, blond with fantastic athletic ability, Gabby is by most people&amp;rsquo;s standards beautiful. She is also the only child of a wealthy prominent, Texas rancher. Her mother Anne, with whom she was very close, died when Gabby was in her teens. Growing up, Gabby has always been able to lean on her daddy for strength and support. For two years, she has been living with her attorney boyfriend, Richard Wright, but the relationship of late is becoming increasingly distant, especially since she learns of his infidelities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Brett Matthews, the handsome, young Adonis, club tennis pro, sexually assaults her and rips a cherished necklace from her neck, Gabby cannot find her voice to protest, nor does she find the voice to tell anyone about this horrific episode for quite some time. The story relays Gabby&amp;rsquo;s subsequent months of anguish and confusion. As the story unfolds, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that appearances are deceiving. Over time, Gabby gains some strength as she begins to gain a deeper understanding of what motivates people to take certain actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can her new found insights allow her to forgive? Will she be able to release the knot of silence?&lt;/p&gt;" />
