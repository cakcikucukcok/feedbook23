  <title>Mine to Save - Diana Gardin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;No one does Romantic Suspense like Diana Gardin.&quot; -- Susan Stoker,&lt;i&gt; New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author&lt;br&gt;  A sexy and suspenseful standalone in the Rescue Ops series.&lt;br&gt;  This time, he&#39;ll have to save one of his own...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  I make everything complicated. Instead of being content owning a bar, I accept a job with the Rescue Ops team at Night Eagle Security. Apparently, guys with Special Forces explosives training are hard to come by. And instead of hooking up with one of the many women who flirt with me, I have to fall for hacker Sayward Diaz. Not only is she one of my new co-workers, she&#39;s also just become my first assignment. Like I said, &lt;i&gt;complicated&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When Sayward&#39;s father dies and his secret ties to the Colombia cartel put her in danger, it&#39;s my job to keep her safe at all costs. For a woman who&#39;s more comfortable with computers than humans, she&#39;s not exactly thrilled to have me as her bodyguard--or by our undeniable spark. And with threats coming at us from all sides, I can&#39;t let our attraction compromise her safety. Because if I do, my first mission might be my last." />
