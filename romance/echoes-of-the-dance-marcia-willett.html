  <title>Echoes of the Dance - Marcia Willett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the mellow stone house of his childhood, Roly Carradine has found refuge in the stream running past the garden where a heron makes his nest. A broken marriage and a terrible burden of guilt made Roly remove himself from his busy London life; here in Cornwall he welcomes Kate, who also seeks refuge from the grief of losing her husband, and young Daisy Quin, a dancer recovering from a back injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roly&#39;s son Nat, a garden designer with his own secret, lives not far away, and is plagued by the unsympathetic visits of his mother Monica, Roly&#39;s ex-wife. Daisy, her burgeoning talent frustrated by her back problems, has been taken in by Mim, Roly&#39;s sister and a brilliant ballerina until an accident forced her into early retirement. Living in Bath, Daisy thinks she has found love with the attractive schoolmaster in the nearby flat---but her dreams prove to be false ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Treating Marcia Willett&#39;s ardent fans to a return visit with some of her most endearing characters from previous books, &lt;i&gt;Echoes of the Dance&lt;/i&gt; is a gem of a story to be savored.&lt;/p&gt;" />
