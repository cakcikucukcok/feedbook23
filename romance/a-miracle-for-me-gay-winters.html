&lt;P&gt;Now John has come across some information that could bring it all crashing down around them. He learns that the most dangerous and organized gang in Chicago has something of great value to Michealsomething that John knows Micheal would do anything to protect and recover. But Micheal refuses to be blackmailed and instead hires a band of ruthless mercenaries to recover this precious itemat any cost.&lt;/P&gt;
