&lt;p&gt;Romance, sexual attraction, and the physical connection between persons are natural and as basic as breathing. Romance, sexual relationships, and physical contact should provide each of us with a positive, happy experience, regardless of long-term outcome. Loveand lustat first sight, emotionally fulfilling relationships, and even happily ever after really do exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These vignettes describe satisfying emotional and physical relationships between men and women, most of whom meet fortuitously, who follow their instincts to a pleasing culmination, perhaps to a satisfying relationship. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chance Encounters and Pleasant Interludes&lt;/i&gt; answers questions like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
	Can an apple be the impetus for a lasting relationship? It worked for Eve.&lt;/br&gt;
	Can a chilly experience lead to a torrid resolution?&lt;/br&gt;
	Can a story from the grave restore luster to a dying relationship?&lt;/br&gt;
	Can teenage romance be successfully rekindled?&lt;/br&gt;
	Can a heart attack inspire a heart experience?&lt;/br&gt;
	Can working late lead to a lifelong experience?&lt;/br&gt;
	Can love overcome friendship?&lt;/br&gt;" />
