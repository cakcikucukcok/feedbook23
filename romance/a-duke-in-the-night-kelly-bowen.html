  <title>A Duke in the Night - Kelly Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;An enchanting historical romance from the 2018 RITA award-winning author that &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sarah MacLean calls &quot;a charming, clever, and engaging storyteller.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Named to All About Romance&#39;s &quot;The Best of 2018!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Duke. Scoundrel. Titan of business. August Faulkner is a man of many talents, not the least of which is enticing women into his bedchamber. He&#39;s known-and reviled-for buying and selling companies, accumulating scads of money, and breaking hearts. It&#39;s a reputation he wears like a badge of honor, and one he intends to keep. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Clara Hayward, the headmistress of the Haverhall School for Young Ladies, on the other hand, is above reproach. Yet when she&#39;s reunited with August all she can think of is the way she felt in his arms as they danced a scandalous waltz ten long years ago. Even though her head knows that he is only back in her life to take over her family&#39;s business, her heart can&#39;t help but open to the very duke who could destroy it for good. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Where have you been all my life, Kelly Bowen? If Julia Quinn, Sarah MacLean, and Lisa Kleypas were to extract their writing DNA, mix it in a blender, and have a love child, Kelly Bowen would be it.&quot;-HeroesandHeartbreakers.com" />
