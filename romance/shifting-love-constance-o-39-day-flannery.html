She owns a successful store in Philadelphia, where she uses her special gifts to help the people she meets. Though this doesn&#39;t fulfill her, she is content.  Most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneur Julian McDonald runs an empire.  He&#39;s rich, cynical, bored-and not interested in relationships. He was in love, once, but since her death, there&#39;s been no space in his heart for anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maggie knows as soon as she meets Julian that she could fall in love with him.  But a secret society devoted to bringing the world back into balance has a mysterious agenda for Julian-and doesn&#39;t care about the heart&#39;s wish of a vulnerable shapeshifter...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
