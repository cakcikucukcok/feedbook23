  <title>Ultimate Courage - Piper J. Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LOVE IS AN ACT OF BRAVERY&lt;br&gt;  Retired Navy SEAL Alex Rojas is putting his life back together, one piece at a time. Being a single dad to his young daughter and working at Hope&#39;s Crossing Kennels to help rehab a former guard dog, he struggles every day to control his PTSD. But when Elisa Hall shows up, on the run and way too cautious, she unleashes his every protective instinct. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Elisa&#39;s past never stays in her rearview mirror for long, and she refuses to put anyone else in danger. But with Alex guarding her so fiercely yet looking at her so tenderly, she&#39;s never felt safer . . . or more terrified that the secrets she keeps could put countless people in grave peril. The only way for both to fully escape their demons will take the ultimate act of courage: letting go and learning to trust each other.&lt;br&gt;" />
