  <title>As Long As You Love Me - Ann Aguirre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Most people dream about getting out of Sharon, Nebraska, but after three years away, Lauren Barrett is coming home. She has her reasons: missing her family, losing her college scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But then there&#39;s the reason Lauren can&#39;t admit to anyone: Rob Conrad, her best friend&#39;s older brother.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Football prowess and jaw-dropping good looks made Rob a star in high school. Out in the real world, his job and his relationships are going nowhere. He&#39;s the guy who women love and leave, not the one who makes them think of forever, until Lauren comes back to town, bringing old feelings and new dreams with her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because the only thing more important than figuring out where you truly belong is finding the person you were meant to be with.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Ann Aguirre&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#39;A tender, sweet, and sexy story about how life—and falling in love—can never be planned.&#39;&lt;/strong&gt;—Jennifer L. Armentrout, #1 New York Times bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Wait for You&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#39;I loved everything about this book… I just have two words: more please!&#39;&lt;/strong&gt;—New York Times bestselling author Cora Carmack on &lt;em&gt;I Want It That Way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
