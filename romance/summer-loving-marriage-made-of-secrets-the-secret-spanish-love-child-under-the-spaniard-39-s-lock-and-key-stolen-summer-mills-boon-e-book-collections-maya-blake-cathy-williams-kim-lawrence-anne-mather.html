        &lt;h2&gt;Prepare for summer with these four tempting reads!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marriage Made of Secrets&lt;/em&gt; by Maya Blake&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After the confetti settles…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It takes an earthquake for billionaire businessman Cesare di Goia to realise what’s important in life. His wife might have become a stranger, but he’s determined to keep his heir close.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Returning to the luxurious Lake Como palazzo with her daughter, Ava di Goia feels like an outsider in what was once their home. Although the bond between them is undeniable, the memories, tarnished rings and broken promises make it clear that the secrets that drove them apart are still unresolved…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Secret Spanish Love-Child&lt;/em&gt; by Cathy Williams&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;New boss…love-child scandal!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When plain-Jane Alex McGuire indulged in an innocent flirtation with a staggeringly perfect stranger, she never expected their paths to cross again. Meek and dowdy Alex was the ideal distraction for Gabriel Cruz in his heady playboy days… But, since running the Cruz family business has beckoned, frivolous distractions are a thing of the past…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So on Alex’s first day of her new job she not only finds her perfect stranger is her boss…but she must tell him that their short affair left a lasting impression!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Spaniard&#39;s Lock and Key&lt;/em&gt; by Kim Lawrence&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Step into a world of sophistication and glamour, where sinfully seductive heroes await you in luxurious international locations.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Silken webs…silken sheets…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nurse Maggie Ward is as pure as the snow-white uniform she wears. So when she falls for the enticing charms of darkly beautiful Rafael Castenadas she has no idea her unexpected meeting with him isn’t accidental…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not until it’s too late and she’s become tangled up in his carefully spun web…and she’s under his lock and key! Rafael has had to take drastic measures to protect his family name. But he’s beginning to realise that he’s not just interested in keeping Maggie quiet; he wants to give her pleasure!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stolen Summer&lt;/em&gt; by Anne Mather&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;More than an infatuation…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shelley is flattered when younger man Ben tells her she is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen. But surely his interest in her is nothing more than pure lust? After all, she was once his teenage crush…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the gorgeous vet is not free to act on his desires and Shelley doesn’t want to be the one to ruin his engagement. But as their intense passion deepens, doing the right thing may be no longer an option…&lt;/p&gt;
