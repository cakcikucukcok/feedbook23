  <title>Speaking of Love - Ophelia London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Speech teacher and successful matchmaker Mackenzie Simms decides to find a woman for her friend, handsome newspaper tycoon Rick Duffy. Though they&#39;ve been each other&#39;s go-to dates for the past month, Mac and Rick couldn&#39;t be more different: she is outspoken, sarcastic, and completely loathes his privileged lifestyle. He&#39;s laid-back, unassuming, and seems comfortable at an upper-class charity function. So why can&#39;t she stop thinking about him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rick knows he and the opinionated-though-adorable Mackenzie are better off as friends, so he agrees to the double-date getaway Mac plans at his family cabin. But seeing Mac cuddle up with her &quot;friendly&quot; date rankles Rick beyond reason, and Mac regrets her matchmaking scheme the minute she sees the way her beauty-queen cousin looks at Rick. Can Mac &#39;fess up to what&#39;s really in her heart, when speaking her mind puts everything at risk?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Perfect Kisses series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Book #1 - Playing at Love  &lt;br&gt;Book #2 - Speaking of Love  &lt;br&gt;Book #3 - Falling for Her Soldier&lt;br&gt;Book #4 - Making Waves&lt;/p&gt;" />
