  <title>Legunda&#39;s Fictional Pack - Tashema Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Ultimate Choice
As I sat in my mothers bedroom, one crazy boresome and lonely night, a thousand words flashed across my imaginary sight. What were they all about? It was definitely not about my complicated home life. It was about love in pain, happiness, sorrow, darkness, sickness, poverty, wealth, and heavens glorious light.
How could I have such a wonderful experience without sharing them with you? It is my delight. The pages of this novel were written to give you a love-exploding paradise beyond the small vacuum of affection in your mind.
From Lifes Broken Pieces to The Gift, The Seventh Grader, Mr Honey, Pokey, and sixteen more, Thats right, flabbergasting, isnt it? Just at your fingertips. Relax, slowly skip through the pages of this book, and allow me to take you on a love fictional trip." />
