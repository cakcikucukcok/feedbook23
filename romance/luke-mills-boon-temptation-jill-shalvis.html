  <title>Luke (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - Jill Shalvis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;E.R. head Dr. Luke Walker saves all of his bedside manner for his patients. With the hospital staff he&#39;s outspoken, tough, no-nonsense…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;until now. Disciplinary action from the hospital board has landed him a three-month stint at the Healing Waters Clinic. And working around aromatherapy, acupuncture and yoga seems to be having a remarkable effect on him. But not nearly the effect Faith McDowell–the fiery redheaded director of the clinic–is having on his libido!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The truth is Luke and Faith clash over everything–except their passion for healing people…and their passion for each other. Making love to Faith has a remarkable healing effect on Luke, putting a sexy smile on his face. Problem is, Luke Walker, who has done his best not to need anyone, finds himself needing her. So now he has to use his most persuasive bedside manner to convince Faith that this passion is for keeps.&lt;/p&gt;
