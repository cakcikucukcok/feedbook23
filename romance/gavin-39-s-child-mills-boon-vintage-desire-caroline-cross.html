          &lt;strong&gt;BACHELORS &amp; BABIES THE SECRET BABY &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gavin Cantrell had a son! An adorable baby boy who looked just like him. The new father would celebrate and pass out cigars, but there was one hitch - Gavin&#39;s child was two years old. And his estranged wife had some explaining to do… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Annie had been a new bride with a surprise baby on the way when Gavin had walked out of her life. And now her husband had come home a sexy stranger who&#39;d betrayed her. Gavin vowed to be a full-time father, and little Sam did need a daddy. But to make a full-time family, Annie needed back the man she&#39;d married… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BACHELORS AND BABIES:&lt;em&gt; Three men get more than they ever expected when they connect with the woman of their dreams… .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
