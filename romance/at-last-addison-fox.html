  <title>At Last - Addison Fox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meet the Brooklyn Brotherhood: three brothers who escaped rough childhoods in Park Heights, Brooklyn who grew into fiercely loyal, sexy men - and who find love when they&#39;re least expecting it.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a year of turmoil, Emma Vandenburg Bradley returned home to Park Heights to run her family&#39;s business - a Brooklyn institution - Unity brewery. Still trying to get her feet back under her, she definitely doesn&#39;t want to be on the spectacularly bad date that ends with getting caught in a bar fight and her high school crush coming to her rescue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nick Kelley&#39;s career in the NFL was cut short, but now he has a successful bar in Brooklyn and his dream of buying the Unity brewery is about to come true. Until he realizes that the mystery woman he saved--and shared a steamy kiss with--is none other than his high school chemistry partner, Emma...who happens to be a part owner of Unity. And she&#39;s not interested in selling her family&#39;s legacy. &lt;br&gt;When Emma and Nick find themselves on opposing sides, both are willing to do anything to win. But as their connection grows deeper, they become torn: Can they choose between their love for Unity and their plans for the future--and for each other?&lt;/p&gt;" />
