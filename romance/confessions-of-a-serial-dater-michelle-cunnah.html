  <title>Confessions of a Serial Dater - Michelle Cunnah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Another great tale of love gone wild from author Michelle Cunnah, a favourite voice of Avon Trade fans whose loveable characters are creating a stir.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A good relationship is like a pair of comfortable shoes, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first, they may pinch and squeeze, but with time (and blisters) they mould to your feet for a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosie Mayford isn&#39;t sure she believes this theory-after all, she takes a size eleven wide, so she has first-hand experience of the trials and tribulations of finding exactly the right shoes. She&#39;s praying finding the right man won&#39;t be nearly that hard. With the &quot;help&quot; of her meddling family and friends, it&#39;s not, even if she partly found a Mr. Right just to get them off her back. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now what? Rosie and Jonathan couldn&#39;t be in more different places in their lives, and they are about to find out just how exhilarating-and disastrous--a mismatched love affair can be. Will they get to the part where they&#39;re broken in and life is nothing but great sex and comforting hugs, or will one of them get sent off in scorn like a pair of too-small stilettos that felt okay in the store? What do you do when Mr. Right gets the timing wrong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
