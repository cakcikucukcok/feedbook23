  <title>Bulletproof Hearts - Brenda Harlen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Assistant D.A. Natalie Vaughn came to Fairweather to build a better life for her son and erase the mistakes of her past. All she wanted was a fresh start--she had no desire for danger or romance. Until Lieutenant Dylan Creighton walked into her office.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;The sexy, blue-eyed cop had only one goal: to bring down the leader of the local crime syndicate, the man responsible for destroying his family. His attraction to the beautiful attorney was a distraction he couldn&#39;t allow--until she stumbled onto a murder scene and placed herself in the line of fire. Forced to stay close to protect Natalie, his feelings--and hers--soon gave way to passion. And only then did they realize that the greatest danger they faced might be falling in love." />
