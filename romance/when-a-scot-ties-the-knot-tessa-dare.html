  <title>When a Scot Ties the Knot - Tessa Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On the cusp of her first London season, Miss Madeline Gracechurch was shy, pretty, and talented with a drawing pencil, but hopelessly awkward with gentlemen. She was certain to be a dismal failure on the London marriage mart. So Maddie did what generations of shy, awkward young ladies have done: she invented a sweetheart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Scottish sweetheart. One who was handsome and honorable and devoted to her, but conveniently never around. Maddie poured her heart into writing the imaginary Captain MacKenzie letter after letter . . . and by pretending to be devastated when he was (not really) killed in battle, she managed to avoid the pressures of London society entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until years later, when this kilted Highland lover of her imaginings shows up in the flesh. The real Captain Logan MacKenzie arrives on her doorstep&amp;#8212;handsome as anything, but not entirely honorable. He&amp;#39;s wounded, jaded, in possession of her letters . . . and ready to make good on every promise Maddie never expected to keep.&lt;/p&gt;" />
