  <title>Finding It - Cora Carmack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you have to lose yourself to find where you truly belong . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most girls would kill to spend months traveling around Europe after college graduation with no responsibility, no parents, and no-limit credit cards. Kelsey Summers is no exception. She&#39;s having the time of her life . . . or that&#39;s what she keeps telling herself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a lonely business trying to find out who you are, especially when you&#39;re afraid you won&#39;t like what you discover. No amount of drinking or dancing can chase away Kelsey&#39;s loneliness, but maybe Jackson Hunt can. After a few chance meetings, he convinces her to take a journey of adventure instead of alcohol. With each new city and experience, Kelsey&#39;s mind becomes a little clearer and her heart a little less hers. Jackson helps her unravel her own dreams and desires. But the more she learns about herself, the more Kelsey realizes how little she knows about Jackson. &lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Finding It - Cora Carmack</i></b> | Finding it is the 3rd book in Cora Carmack’s Losing It series. I adore these books!! I actually “read” the first two books in the series via audiobook during my commute. If you don’t listen to audiobooks, you should try it. I am a skimmer (I know, bad Kate!) and I tend to skim books then go back and read the important parts.<br /><b><i>Finding It (Losing It, #3) by Cora Carmack</i></b> | Finding It is the third in the Losing It series by Cora Carmack, I downloaded it along with Faking it after finishing, and really enjoying Losing It. Kelsey Summers left college to travel around Europe, hoping to leave her mark on the world, be the girl that travelled, be the girl that's been everywhere.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Finding It (Audible Audio Edition): Cora ...</i></b> | Amazing, heartbreaking, and beautiful Cora Carmack delivers again with Finding It, a novel proving that while trust can be breakable, it can also be mended.
