        &lt;p&gt;Courtesy of his rakish good looks and powerful prestige, Jared Gillette was every woman&#39;s fantasy. Yet, as far as Nicki Holliday was concerned, he was 100% Scrooge! Sure, she felt a jolt of electricity whenever Jared ravished her with his sexy-as-sin eyes…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;but a practically penniless Nicki was infuriated because her &quot;Bah, Humbug!&quot; boss had her fired. Then he proceeded to charm her into caring for his beloved daughter! Well, a soft-hearted Nicki couldn&#39;t resist the challenge of spreading warm holiday cheer throughout his arctic mansion. Before long, a gruffly tender Jared swept the orphaned beauty off her feet. But would it take a miracle to awaken the jaded tycoon to the wonder of love?&lt;/p&gt;
