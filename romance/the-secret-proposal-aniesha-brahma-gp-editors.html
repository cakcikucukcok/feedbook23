  <title>The Secret Proposal - Aniesha Brahma, GP Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Twenty-one year old Larissa Chakroborty (better known as Jasmine) has been forced into the company of her parents&amp;#39; friends&amp;#39; son, twenty-five year old Tanveer Bhattacharya (aka Veer) ever since she was thirteen and he was seventeen.&lt;br /&gt;
Jasmine found herself slowly getting drawn towards this teenage boy and harbours an unrequited crush on him, long after he disappears from her life in order to pursue a college degree.&lt;br /&gt;
Eight years later Veer returns. Jasmine finds herself going to his welcome home party, and neither of them recognises each other on the first meeting. Upon discovering that Jasmine is now a Master&amp;#39;s student in a reputed college, Veer makes her a rather strange proposal. He wants her to pretend that they&amp;#39;re in love and would eventually settle down in life, for he wishes to avoid tying the knot with a girl of his parents&amp;#39; choice.&lt;br /&gt;
The constant ego battle between the two, the love-hate relationship, break ups and realisations is what The Secret Proposal is all about, wherein love would eventually find a way.&lt;br /&gt;
Coupled with birthday parties, engagement announcements, Durga Pujos, weddings, the harrowing rituals, Christmas time fun, the crazy duo have a long way to go before they realise what their act would eventually cost them.&lt;br /&gt;
Is it enough to get your long time love to be in a &amp;#39;pretense relationship&amp;#39; with you?&lt;br /&gt;
Does one grand gesture convince you that you&amp;#39;ve found your knight in shining armour?&lt;br /&gt;
And why is it that when you have someone, you don&amp;#39;t want them&amp;hellip; and when you lose them, you want them back?&lt;br /&gt;
Is Veer merely pretending to be in love with Jasmine? And will Jasmine ever get over her undying love for Veer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aniesha Brahma knew she wanted to be a writer since she was six years old. She was schooled in Dolna Day School and went on to pursue B.A., M.A., and M.Phil in Comparative Literature from Jadavpur Univeristy. She currently lives in Kolkata, with her family and five pet cats. The Secret Proposal was her debut novel, followed by The Guitar Girl. She was a contributing author with her story &amp;#39;The Difference&amp;#39;, in the anthology: Voices, Old &amp;amp; New. When Our Worlds Collide is her third work of fiction, and first novella.&lt;/p&gt;" />
