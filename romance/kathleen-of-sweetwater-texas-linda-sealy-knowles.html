  <title>Kathleen of Sweetwater, Texas - Linda Sealy Knowles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story filled with passion and mistrust. A lovely spinster and a tall, dark stranger ignite a spark of true love that could unite two lonely hearts.
Kathleen 
Kathleen Parker was the picture of primness and propriety. She was a thirty-year-old beauty with big green eyes that could look straight through a persons soul. In town, they called her the old spinster lady. Kathleen wasnt a stranger to their ridicule, because she knew that men only wanted her five hundredacre cattle ranchnot her. At eighteen, she was heartbroken by her first love. Thereafter, she vowed to never trust a man again. When a stranger, a rugged cowboy, settles in next door, Kathleens heart began to feel more than friendship toward him. Could she learn to love and trust this cowboy? 
Matt 
A cowboy from Abilene, Matt Moore moved into the ranch next door. He is single, forty, ruggedly handsome, and had been betrayed by his fiance. Matt has an accident, and Kathleens foreman finds him on the road and brings him home. While being in the care of Kathleen, Matt discovers that his heart had softened, and he desires more than friendship with the hard-headed beauty. It was hard to deny the attraction they both felt for each other. Matts desire is strong enough to put trust in the lovely Kathleen, but will Kathleens past hurt always be a barrier between them?" />
