  <title>Tempting Janey - Mary Lynn Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When Dillon Reed strolls into Janey Mayfield&#39;s candy shop, the past opens up like a forbidden door. The imposing ex-marine turned high school principal is a shocking reminder of an affair that shattered all their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After the scandal that destroyed two marriages, Janey fled to Colorado with her daughter. Now, three years later, she&#39;s come back to South Carolina, determined to make a success of the business she inherited and keep control of her well-ordered life. But it&#39;s an uphill battle, what with her rebellious teenage daughter, a rash of break-ins plaguing the town, and an ex-husband with a grudge.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She tells herself she doesn&#39;t want the attraction she feels for Dillon. She doesn&#39;t want to be vulnerable to what his heated glance has put on offer: sweet, irresistible passion. But Janey discovers that the more determined she is to avoid temptation, the more it stands in her way.&lt;/p&gt;
