  <title>The Rancher and the Runaway Bride (36 Hours, Book 7) - Susan Mallery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;New York Times bestselling author Susan Mallery returns with a poignant classic about finding love and freeing oneself from the past.&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Michelle Sanderson may appear to be a strong, independent woman, but on the inside she&#39;s still the wounded girl who fled home years ago. A young army vet, Michelle returns to the quaint Blackberry Island Inn to claim her inheritance and recover from the perils of war. Instead, she finds the owner&#39;s suite occupied by the last person she wants to see–Carly Williams. She and Michelle were once inseparable, until a shocking betrayal destroyed their friendship. And now Carly is implicated in the financial disaster lurking behind the inn&#39;s cheerful veneer.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Single mother Carly has weathered enough rumors, lies and secrets for a lifetime, and is finally starting to move forward with her life. But if the Blackberry Island Inn goes under, Carly and her daughter will go with it. To save their livelihoods, Carly and Michelle will undertake a turbulent truce. It&#39;ll take more than a successful season to move beyond their devastating past, but with a little luck and a beautiful summer, they may just rediscover the friendship of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
