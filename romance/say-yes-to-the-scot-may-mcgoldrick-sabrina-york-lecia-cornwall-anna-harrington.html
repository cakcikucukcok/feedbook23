  <title>Say Yes to the Scot - May McGoldrick, Sabrina York, Lecia Cornwall, Anna Harrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You are formally invited to the Highland wedding event of the year. These four lasses are about to meet their matches in an original digital anthology featuring stories from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sabrina York, Lecia Cornwall, Anna Harrington, and May McGoldrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW A LASS WED A HIGHLANDER by Lecia Cornwall&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this retelling of The Princess and The Pea, Laird Alex Munro of Culmore has just five weeks to find a bride and marry her...or else the clan will be cursed with ill luck. Cait MacLeod finds herself caught in a clan feud, and when she tries to stop a deadly raid, she ends up as Alex Munro&#39;s prisoner. With timing running out, is this couple meant to be? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A MATCH MADE IN HEATHER by Anna Harrington&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;She was the laird&#39;s daughter. He was nothing more than a penniless, nameless Scot with nothing to offer but his heart. Fate tore them apart, but now he&#39;s back in her life with status, money and a title. Can they let go of past hurts and find love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A MIDSUMMER WEDDING by May McGoldrick&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Their marriage was two decades in the making. The young, educated woman and her highland, pirate husband, betrothed when they were still children. But on the day of their wedding, Elizabeth Hay and Alexander Macpherson are in for a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SCOT SAYS I DO by Sabrina York&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Catherine Ross&#39;s world is turned upside down when her brother gambles away every penny they own. But to make matters worse?  He&#39;s lost everything to none other than Duncan Mackay, the rugged Scot who Catherine loved for years--but he never noticed her, and now she positively loathes him.  But her brother&#39;s in danger of going to Newgate, and the despicable Duncan has a plan- she can claim back the money and save her brother.  If she marries him...&lt;/p&gt;" />
