Growing up with a privileged life Nadya and Meagan thought life was perfect.

One night changed their lives forever.  Justin is a 23 year old boxer who was preparing for the biggest fight in his career, when he wasn&#39;t boxing he spent his time in the studio or his other job; leader of the Corner Hustlers in Queens. His gang was well known, and feared by many. Justin with his good looks and slick tongue had no problem getting any girl he wanted into his bed. Never falling or showing love to anyone but family or his gang, he never thought he&#39;d find &quot;the one&quot; or even anyone that came close. One night changed his life and him forever." />
