She has a great job, a wonderful family, a lovely house. She has good friends. And she lives in a town where people know her, care about her. So &lt;i&gt;what&#39;s missing?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Passion--as she finds out when she meets Zack Foster.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Zack&#39;s a veterinarian who&#39;s recently moved to Shelter Valley after the failure of a marriage he&#39;d considered perfect. He still likes being with women, but now prefers his romances &quot;short and sweet.&quot;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Randi and Zack learn what it is to feel truly passionate about someone else--and they begin to want the passion they&#39;ve discovered. But to get something, you have to give something up. Can they exchange contentment for happiness--even if greater happiness means greater risk?" />
