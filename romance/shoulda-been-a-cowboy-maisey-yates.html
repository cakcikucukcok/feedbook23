  <title>Shoulda Been a Cowboy - Maisey Yates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;In this sexy, sweet prequel novella to her new series, &lt;em&gt;USA TODAY&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Maisey Yates welcomes readers to the charming small town of Copper Ridge, Oregon, where it&#39;s never too late for second chances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There&#39;s not much about his teenage years that Jake Caldwell can be proud of. Except maybe for keeping his hands off cute, kindhearted Cassie Ventimiglia. She was the only one who saw him as more than a tattooed rebel who couldn&#39;t wait to leave the ranching life behind. Now he&#39;s back in Copper Ridge to sell his father&#39;s property&amp;#8212;and staying right above Cassie&#39;s coffee shop. And out of nowhere, the girl he&#39;s never forgotten is offering a whole lot more than fresh-baked muffins&amp;#8230;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jake&#39;s dark, smoldering appeal hasn&#39;t changed one bit. But Cassie has. Following everyone else&#39;s rules didn&#39;t quite work out. Time to ask for what she&#39;s always wanted&amp;#8230;and what Jake&#39;s more than happy to give: a wild, hot romance that could make a one-time bad boy realize he&#39;s back for good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t miss &lt;em&gt;Part Time Cowboy&lt;/em&gt;, the first in the Copper Ridge series, from HQN Books!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
