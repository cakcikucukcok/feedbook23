  <title>The Playboy&#39;s Mistress (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (Christmas, Book 26) - Kim Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When Darcy was persuaded to host her family&#39;s Christmas gathering, she started making detailed lists and mentally prepared herself for a hectic couple of weeks. But her plans were disrupted by a surprise new neighbor–a playboy tycoon, who seemed to know exactly what he wanted to give Darcy for Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As far as Reece Erskine was concerned, Christmas couldn&#39;t be over soon enough. But he was quite happy to give Darcy a few kisses–and much, much more–under the mistletoe. In fact, he insisted on it!&lt;/p&gt;
