  <title>Bound Hearts Series Books 1-3 - Lora Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Lora Leigh has captivated millions of readers with her sizzling hot erotic tales. Here together for the first time in a convenient ebook bundle are the first three of her popular Bound Hearts novels: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forbidden Pleasure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;People have heard fleeting rumors about The Club. But only its members--many of them Washington insiders--know the truth: That it&#39;s a place where men can share their women with a carefully selected male partner. Former FBI John &quot;Mac&quot; McCoy resigned his Club membership when he married Keiley Hardin. Tempting and innocent, sweet and sexy, she would never accept Mac&#39;s desire to share her with another man. Still, Mac&#39;s fantasies of sharing Keiley haunt his dreams. And his passions... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wicked Pleasure&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Jaci Wright has been running from the Falladay twins, Chase and Cam, for seven years now. Fears of the desires they arouse in her, and the knowledge of the relationship they wanted with her, spurred her to run, to find a life that kept her traveling the globe and out of their reach...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Only Pleasure&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since Chase Falladay came to her rescue two years ago, Kia Stanton has never been able to forget the powerful man or the kind of life he leads. So two years later when she runs into Chase and his friend, Khalid, and leaves with them that night, she knows exactly where it is all heading. However, little prepares her for what it is like to be in Chase&#39;s arms, and in his bed. After years of holding back, Kia is finally able to be the woman she&#39;s always dreamed of being in his arms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
