  <title>The Millionaire&#39;s Gamble - Sarah Ballance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Oh my goodness, Sarah has done it again with this fun, sexy, hot entertaining story. This is one of the best books I have read this year.&quot; -Rhonda @ NetGalley &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seducing a millionaire playboy couldn&#39;t be that hard, right? When Kennedy Price&#39;s job as PA to an investor puts her up close and personal with the hotel mogul who fathered her sister&#39;s child, she hatches a plan to prove paternity. She just needs to get close enough to snag a hair. She never expected she&#39;d stumble onto evidence that could derail his business deal, potentially costing him millions. Or that she&#39;d find herself attracted to the sinfully hot playboy who has everything to lose.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jagger Hamilton can prove he didn&#39;t father Kennedy&#39;s nephew, but the stunning brunette doesn&#39;t believe him. She knows he&#39;s a millionaire several times over, and that money can buy anything...even lies. When she blackmails him to be a father to a kid who isn&#39;t his or lose his investor, he plays hard and fast to make sure he gets what he wants. And with sparks flying and passion exploding between them, what he wants is the one thing she promises he&#39;ll never have: her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
