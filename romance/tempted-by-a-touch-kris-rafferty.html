  <title>Tempted by a Touch - Kris Rafferty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;People keep dying around Harper MacLain. Try as she might, she can&#39;t stop bad things from happening to those she loves. When her closely guarded secret lands her in the middle of her ex-boyfriend&#39;s investigation, she&#39;s in over her head. She hates that Detective Lucas Sullivan is in her life again, tempting her to fall back into bad habits...and his bed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Harper left him, Lucas tried not to care, burying himself in his job instead. Then Harper became the job. Now they&#39;re on the run, and all he can think about is keeping her safe...and his hands off her. Lucas knows she&#39;s the key to solving his case, if he can keep them alive long enough to do it. And that&#39;s the trick...because falling in love can kill you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The An Unlikely Hero series is best enjoyed in order:&lt;br&gt;Reading order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 - Betrayed by a Kiss&lt;br&gt;Book #2 - Tempted by a Touch&lt;br&gt;Book #3 - Seduced by Sin&lt;/p&gt;" />
