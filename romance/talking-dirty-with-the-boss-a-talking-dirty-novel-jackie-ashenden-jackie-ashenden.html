  <title>Talking Dirty With the Boss: A Talking Dirty Novel - Jackie Ashenden, Jackie Ashenden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Talking Dirty With the Boss by Jackie Ashenden:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marisa Clair wants to get her artist dreams back on track after a life detour. That means no partying, no shopping...and definitely no men to distract her. Should be easy, but there&#39;s something about her hot and exceedingly uptight boss and she can&#39;t seem to stop herself from ruffling Mr. Tall, Dark and Irritating.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Financial consultant Luke McNamara lives his life strictly by schedule - his OCD simply won&#39;t allow him to do anything else. And the very last thing he needs is a sassy blonde putting lipstick on his collar and messing with his routine. She annoys the hell out of him so why can&#39;t he stop thinking about the color of her panties...and how free he feels when he&#39;s with her? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marisa and Luke&#39;s plans to steer clear of one another are shot to hell after a hot office encounter. Now the two of them will have to learn to get along as they face a much more permanent reminder of their lack of self-control - a pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
