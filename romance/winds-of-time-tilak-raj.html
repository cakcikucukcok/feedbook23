      <meta name="description" content="The world is fast speeding toward its total annihilation. Peace has disappeared from the face of this planet earth. It seems all the forces of evil have climbed up out of the hades to destroy this world completely. Love, kindness, charity, honesty, integrity are no more seen among masses. Nobody cares for anybody. They are out to kill others. They are all experts at doing evil, as the 5th century BC prophet Micah has observed. One can not confide inner secrets to one&#39;s life partner. Very horrible hard times have fallen on humanity. Terror is fast spreadind world wide. Millions have already perished in world wars. An other world war looms large on all humanity. The lead figure, Walker Good man, goes researching the mysteries of this universe, starting with Socrates . He comes to the conclusion that historical God-man Jesus Christ is coming again to lift his saints to his heavenly Kingdom. All others will perish in the everlasting hell fire and burning brimstone." />
