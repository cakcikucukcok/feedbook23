  <title>The Dogwalker Trilogy - Susan Donovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readers love Susan Donovan&#39;s fabulous combination of  emotional intensity and fun in bestselling Dogwalker Trilogy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Not That Kind of Girl &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Roxie Bloom is through with love. Fresh on the heels of a bad break-up, she&#39;s decided to devote all her time to her man-slamming website--and her man-hating dog, Lilith. But this pit-bull-Boxer is so good at unleashing her fury (and her owner&#39;s) that the male victims keep piling up...and now it&#39;s time to get some sensitivity training. Enter Eli Gallagher, one of the best--and hottest--canine experts in town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Night She Got Lucky&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her marriage is over. Her newspaper career went belly up. And it won&#39;t be long before her two teenage sons are off to college...and then what? Sometimes it seems like the only thing Ginger Garrison can count on is her beloved Bichon Frisé and the loyal women in her dog-walking group. But her luck is about to take a wild turn. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ain&#39;t Too Proud to Beg&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josie Sheehan collects failed relationships the way some women collect designer handbags. Now, at thirty-five, she has exactly one male in her life: her Labradoodle, Genghis. In fact Josie, along with the three very single women in her dog-walking group, has recently sworn off men, resigning herself to long walks in the park with her devoted, four-legged friend. All bets are off, however, when she meets Rick Rousseau, a pet-company CEO who is smart, sexy, and, best of all, head-over-heels for Josie.&lt;/p&gt;" />
