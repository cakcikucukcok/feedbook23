  <title>Her Royal Protector (a Johari Crown Novel) - Alexandra Sellers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Research scientist Aly Percy has never been known for her looks, but she is passionate about saving wildlife. In fact, she&#39;ll do anything for her current project even if it means spending time alone with the sexy Cup Companion Arif al Najimi on his private yacht. A man who sets her nerves on edge, and makes her feel things she never has before. She doesn&#39;t know why he&#39;s interested in her, and doesn&#39;t trust his motives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arif doesn&#39;t understand why the researcher is haunting his dreams. Maybe it&#39;s because she&#39;s beautiful and intelligent, and he loves her passion for her project. He also feels a need to protect her from the dangers of traveling alone to do her work. More than anything, he wants to show her how beautiful she is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They come from different worlds, and they have a difficult time trusting. The passion is explosive between them, but it may not be enough to bridge their worlds. Can the ugly duckling find true love with the Cup Companion?&lt;/p&gt;" />
