  <title>The Murderer&#39;s Maid - Erika Mailman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bram Stoker Award finalist Erika Mailman brings the true story of the brutal murder of Lizzie Borden’s father and stepmother into new focus by adding a riveting contemporary narrative. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Murderer’s Maid&lt;/i&gt; interweaves the stories of two women: one, the servant of infamous Lizzie Borden, and the other a modern-day barista fleeing from an attempt on her life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Trapped by servitude and afraid for her own safety, Irish maid Bridget finds herself an unwilling witness to the tensions in the volatile Borden household. As Lizzie seethes with resentment, Bridget tries to perform her duties and keep her mouth shut. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Unknowingly connected to the legendary crime of a century ago, Brooke, the illegitimate daughter of an immigrant maid, struggles to conceal her identity and stay a jump ahead of the men who want to kill her. When she unexpectedly falls in love with Anthony, a local attorney, she has to decide whether to stop running and begin her life anew. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With historical detail and taut, modern storytelling, Erika Mailman writes a captivating novel about identity, choices, freedom, and murder. She offers readers a fresh perspective on the notorious crime and explores the trials of immigrants seeking a better life while facing down fear and oppression, today and throughout history. Intelligent and detailed, &lt;i&gt;The Murderer’s Maid&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping read from beginning to bloody conclusion." />
