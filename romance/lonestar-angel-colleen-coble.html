  <title>Lonestar Angel - Colleen Coble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eden&amp;rsquo;s hope is rekindled when Clay delivers astounding news: their daughter has been found.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago Eden and Clay Larson&amp;rsquo;s baby was stolen and never found. Eden blamed herself, Clay lost himself in work. Their young and rocky marriage ended. Or so Eden thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now &amp;nbsp;Eden&amp;rsquo;s moved to a new town. She&amp;rsquo;s found faith and is trying to rebuild her life. She&amp;rsquo;s even dating again&amp;mdash;a sweet guy who plans to marry her someday. But then Clay arrives out of the blue and delivers shocking news: they&amp;rsquo;re still married. What&amp;rsquo;s more, Clay has been searching for Brianna all this time. And he believes he&amp;rsquo;s found her: their daughter is in Bluebird, Texas, at a youth ranch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To uncover the truth, Eden and Clay sign on as counselors at Bluebird Ranch. Working together, they rediscover their love for each other. But danger is closing in&amp;mdash;Eden, Clay, and their young charges are in jeopardy. As they fight to save their family, Eden realizes that God has been fighting for them all along. And His plans are for a more abundant life than they&amp;rsquo;ve dared to hope.&lt;/p&gt;" />
