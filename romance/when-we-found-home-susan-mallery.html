  <title>When We Found Home - Susan Mallery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;‘Susan Mallery never disappoints.’ Debbie Macomber&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Becoming a family will take patience, humour, a little bit of&lt;br /&gt;wine and a whole lot of love…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Life is meant to be savoured, but that’s not easy with&lt;br /&gt;no family, limited prospects and a past you’d rather not talk about. Still, Callie Smith doesn’t know how to feel when she discovers she has a brother and a sister—Malcolm, who grew up with affection, wealth and privilege, and Keira, a streetwise twelve-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Callie doesn’t love being alone, but at least it’s safe. Despite her trepidation, she moves into the grand family home with her siblings and grandfather on the shores of Lake Washington, hoping just maybethis will be the start of a whole new life.&lt;br /&gt;But starting over can be messy. Callie and Keira fit in with each other, but not with their posh new lifestyle, leaving Malcolm feeling like the odd man out in his own home. He was clever enough to turn a sleepy Seattle mail-order food catalog into an online gourmet powerhouse, yet he can’t figure out how to help his new sisters feel secure. But affection isn’t&lt;br /&gt;Malcolm’s strong suit…until a beautiful barista teaches him that an open heart, like the family table, can always make room for more.&lt;/p&gt;
