          &lt;strong&gt;A wager worth its weight in gold!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When it comes to her billionaire boss, Carol Lawrence has always been by the books. But that doesn’t mean she hasn’t noticed Jake Waters’s sex appeal. So when he asks her to be his plus one to a star-studded party, she says yes. But their newfound desire could have consequences…&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;Meagan Quinn has paid her debt to society; now she’s out on parole and must provide for her daughter. It’s weird enough that Garrett Snow, the man she betrayed is offering her a job—and a chance at redemption. Why does she have to find him irresistible, too?&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;Since they were young, tech mogul Max Marquez and socialite Lizzie McQueen have always agreed on one thing: they’re just friends! But fate has thrown them a curve ball in the form of a lovable orphan who needs a good home. Could it change their friendship forever?&lt;/p&gt;
