  <title>Undercover with the Earl - Robyn DeHart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;London, 1838.&lt;/i&gt; The handsome Earl of Somersby may just be the most eligible bachelor in London, but has no interest in a wife. As a member of the Brotherhood, Bennett Haile is far more vested in his undercover duties for the crown and protecting the Queen from would-be assassins. For now he has the perfect tool with which to lure out the villains-a young woman with an uncanny likeness to the queen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spirited Evelyn Marrington is about to live out every country girl&#39;s dream-becoming royalty overnight. Under the tutelage of the arrogant Earl of Somersby, she&#39;ll have to fool the entire court that she is, in fact, the queen. But as danger threatens from every side, Bennett realizes that his lovely little protegé isn&#39;t just placing her life in his hands... She&#39;s stealing his heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Brotherhood of the Sword series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Undercover with the Earl&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Dueling With the Duke&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Eloping With The Princess&lt;/p&gt;" />
