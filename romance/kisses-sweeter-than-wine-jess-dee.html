His friend and partner, Noah. Caught up in guilt after breaking his fiancé&#39;s heart and almost ruining his relationship and partnership with Noah, Declan&#39;s been so preoccupied with living the life he&#39;s expected to lead, he&#39;s ignored his heart...and other organs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noah has waited long enough for Declan to accept they were meant to be together. He&#39;s taken the situation into his own hands and dragged Declan to the Hunter Valley. And he&#39;s invited Violet to join them at a luxury vineyard hotel under the guise of a working weekend to introduce her Declan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convincing the man he loves and the beguiling woman with honey-gold hair to consider his proposal is going to be tough, but Noah is ready to take them both on and make sure they all come out on top...at least once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each story in the Days of Wine and Roses Series is standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Novella #1: Summer Wine&lt;br&gt;Book #2: Red Red Wine&lt;br&gt;Book #3: Kisses Sweeter Than Wine&lt;/p&gt;" />
