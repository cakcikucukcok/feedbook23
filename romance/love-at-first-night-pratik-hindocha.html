  <title>Love at First Night - Pratik Hindocha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;His life is a misery. All he ever longed for was a true love and honesty, and every time he thought that he received what he wished for, it did not take more than a few days for it all to become a long-lost dream that gave him bad memories and a horrible present to live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not far away, she lived the similar life of loneliness, heartbreaks, and nightmares. Peace, happiness, and faith were like a long-lost dream for her. She did want a better future, but she wished to forget a horrible past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though only willing to live alone, they agreed to marry one another. Is their decision right? Will their life ever change? Will they ever find true love? If yes, then in whom?&lt;/p&gt;" />
