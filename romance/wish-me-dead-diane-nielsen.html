  <title>Wish Me Dead - Diane Nielsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Humans are such fragile beings and young Ashton Rider is about to find out how easy it was for an immortal to jerk her chain. One wish from an immortal was all it would take to send her into a hell there was no escape from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ashton&#39;s destiny had been written and on course until a young immortal, Leonard, wanting a new play thing, a new toy, and a friend wished for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skies boiled as the Fates raged at the interference until they were compelled to call on the ageless and powerful Guardian Saul to be their champion, to right the wrong but to do so with no interference to the human. For the ripples of chaos Leonard unleashed would destroy more than one human life if not mended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam Barnhart was an assassin whose very name inspired fear in the gut of anyone unlucky enough to have their name mentioned in the same sentence as his. Little did he know that on a spring day in May, fate would make the decision for him and he would face his deadliest enemy yet, an immortal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Saul be able to do the impossible nad bring back the dead, or will good turn eveila nd unravel destiny?&lt;/p&gt;" />
