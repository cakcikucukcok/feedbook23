  <title>Police Protector (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (The Lawmen: Bullets and Brawn, Book 2) - Elizabeth Heiter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She&#39;s become his whole world…and she&#39;s under fire&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ever since forensics analyst Shaye Mallory survived a police-station shootout, Detective Cole Walker has felt personally responsible for her well-being. Then another shooter takes aim at Shaye. Cole decides the only thing he can do is stay right by her side until he finds the man who wants her dead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cole knows that he must set aside his attraction to Shaye if he&#39;s going to do his job. But as the days – and nights – go on, it becomes harder and harder to resist his feelings. And, as danger moves ever closer to them both, Shaye realizes that her safety might cost her the life of the man she loves.&lt;/p&gt;
