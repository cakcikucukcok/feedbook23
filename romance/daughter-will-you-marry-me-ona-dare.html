  <title>Daughter, Will You Marry Me? - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Next week my daughter will be eighteen years old, and I&amp;#39;m so afraid she is going to leave me. And why wouldn&amp;#39;t she? She&amp;#39;s young and should be adventurous. She should go away to college and enjoy four years of learning and discovering herself. But if I&amp;#39;m honest, I don&amp;#39;t want that. As selfish as it sounds and is, I want to keep her as my own. But how?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
As I&amp;rsquo;m reading the paper tonight, she comes out of the bathroom with nothing but a towel wrapped around herself, water still dripping down her legs, her hair wet and hanging down her back. I gulp and try to catch my breath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She drops her comb on the floor and when she bends down to pick it up, the towel falls from her nubile body and we both freeze. She stands only a few feet away from me and we stare at one another for the longest time. But her stare isn&amp;rsquo;t one of embarrassment that her Daddy saw her naked, no. It&amp;rsquo;s a look that says, &amp;ldquo;Daddy, I want you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Come here, love. Come here and let Daddy touch you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I scooted forward in my recliner as she stepped closer and grabbed her hips, pulling her close to me. Pulling her labia apart with my thumbs, I sniffed her pussy and then licked it tentatively, waiting for a response. When she pulled my head closer and thrust her hips toward my face, I knew everything was going to be okay. She was ready for me. She was ready for Daddy to teach her everything she needed to know about being fucked royally. About being her Daddy&amp;rsquo;s little sex slave. The more these thoughts flit through my brain, the deeper I pushed into her pussy until my face was buried in it." />
