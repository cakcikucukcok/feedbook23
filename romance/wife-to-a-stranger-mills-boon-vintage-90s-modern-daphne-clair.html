          &lt;strong&gt;Stranger in her bed &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Capri recognized the handsome man in front of her as her husband. She knew his name was Rolfe, but other than that he was a complete stranger to her. In fact, she could remember nothing at all about her life, prior to waking up in the hospital bed. Perhaps all she needed was to get home to New Zealand and her memory would return. It didn&#39;t, despite some shocking revelations about herself and her marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One thing she did know: whatever their marital problems might have been, the chemistry between them was as strong as ever. But how could she sleep with a man she barely knew - even if he was her husband?&lt;/p&gt;
