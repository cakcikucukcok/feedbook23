  <title>Sold - Molly Thorne &amp; Natasha Tanner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Russian mail-order bride Van and billionaire mafia boss Ace Hart meet in an unexpected way and fall for each other instantly. They know they can&amp;#39;t be together, though --it&amp;#39;s too dangerous. But that same danger will keep pushing them together. High-stakes gambling, the Russian mob, Chinese gangsters and a whole host of lively side characters fill up this thrilling romantic story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;VAN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Being a mail-order bride should be simple. You get in, you get sold, you get out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
A ticket out of misery and despair. And what&amp;#39;s better, a ticket that someone else pays.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
But I just couldn&amp;#39;t make it work. I was stupid enough to leave the comfort and safety I had found&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
only to wind up falling for the most dangerous man the country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ace Hart is as handsome as he&amp;#39;s powerful, and as dangerous as he&amp;#39;s handsome.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
And I&amp;#39;m attracted to him like a moth to a flame.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I know I should keep well away from him, but the situation I&amp;#39;m in keeps pushing us together.&lt;br /&gt;
And soon there will be no escape.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ACE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When stakes are high, you need rules to survive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
And the stakes are very high. Millions at a time. Billions, even.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Fortunes made and unmade at a poker table.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have two rules that I live by:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
No mercy for cheaters. You cheat, you meet my iron hand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
And the most important one?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Keep my own heart safe no matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve managed to enforce both ... until now. But then this pretty&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
foreigner appeares. Just when shit is about to go down everywhere.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Love is never convenient, but now? It&amp;#39;s suicide. I have to stay away from her,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
for her own protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And yet, to protect her, I must be with her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Man, I fucked up real good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a romantic novel with no cliffhangers and a happy ending. And action. And sex. And plot twists.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
