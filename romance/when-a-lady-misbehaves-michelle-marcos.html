  <title>When A Lady Misbehaves - Michelle Marcos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;AN EROTIC SECRET&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;As a maid at The Pleasure Emporium, Miss April Jardine has witnessed her share of sinful acts, but nothing as brazen as her own money-making scheme. By blackmailing the gentlemen named in the Madame&#39;s private diaries, April can escape a life of drudgery--as long as she avoids the hangman&#39;s noose. All goes swimmingly until she crosses paths with Lord Blackheath, the most powerful judge in England. His wicked gaze suggests he is torn between exposing April and seducing her--and April is only too pleased to oblige.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A SCANDALOUS EMBRACE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Blackheath has no doubt that the alluring firebrand could cripple his family&#39;s finances and reputation with the bat of an eyelash. And yet...April outshines every dull Society belle he&#39;s ever known, and nothing compares to the sensual bliss they share. But trusting this scheming Miss could cost him everything. Will he ever be able to welcome her into his home--and his heart?&lt;/p&gt;" />
