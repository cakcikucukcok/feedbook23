  <title>An Amish Cradle - Beth Wiseman, Amy Clipston, Kathleen Fuller, Vannetta Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tiny fingers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiny toes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lives that will never be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journey with four families as their lives are about to change forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In His Father&amp;rsquo;s Arms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Beth Wiseman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruth Anne has been dreaming about motherhood her entire life. Now she is doubly excited that she and her best friend are due with their children the same week. But when Ruth Anne&amp;rsquo;s baby is born with Down syndrome, she and her husband struggle to understand God&amp;rsquo;s plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Son for Always&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Amy Clipston&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carolyn and Joshua are thrilled to be pregnant with their first child together. Carolyn was just a teenager when she had her son, Benjamin, and she still feels solely responsible to secure his future. As Joshua watches Carolyn struggle to accept his support, he knows he has to find some way to convince her that she&amp;mdash;and Ben&amp;mdash;will always be taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Heart Full of Love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Kathleen Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellie&amp;rsquo;s mother hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped meddling in her personal life since Ellie lost her sight&amp;mdash;and she&amp;rsquo;s taken it up a notch now that Ellie&amp;rsquo;s pregnant. When Ellie gives birth to twins, her mother insists on moving in to care for them. But when her mother&amp;rsquo;s behavior becomes unbearable, Ellie is forced to take a stand . . . and finally find out why &lt;em&gt;Mamm&lt;/em&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t let go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Unexpected Blessing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Vannetta Chapman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 42, Etta discovers she&amp;rsquo;s pregnant again. After a frightening labor, Etta births a baby girl. That joyful moment is followed by months of worry. Will their estranged son, David, return home? Can Mose save the farm or will they be forced to move? Etta must hold tightly to the promise that God will watch over each of her children&amp;mdash;and that He does have a plan for their future.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
