There isn&#39;t a system he can&#39;t infiltrate or a country his team can&#39;t topple. But when he finds Lena Morris, the woman he hates most in the world, on his doorstep, the last thing he wants to do is help her. Or is it really Lena?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lindsey Morris can&#39;t believe her twin sister, Lena, is missing, with only a cryptic text to find the man Lena once betrayed. But as easy as Jace is to look at, getting him to agree to help her find her sister is a lot harder. He refuses to put his team at risk, until they find out the enemy they&#39;re facing may be one they have in common... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Lindsey and Jace race against the clock to save her sister, their shaky truce begins to morph into a fire they can&#39;t control. But their lack of trust might be exactly what gets them killed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
