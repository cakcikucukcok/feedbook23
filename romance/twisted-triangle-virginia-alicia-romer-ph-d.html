  <title>Twisted Triangle - Virginia Alicia Romer Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twisted Triangle is an intriguing and captivating novel that gives a true account of the experiences of its author.  The title is a symbol of the maze of events that entangled the life of its characters, who, but for the mercies of God, were given a second chance to life.  It can be considered Part 2 of her motivational book, Experiencing the Goodness of God, since it is the complete story of what happened.
Written in the third person, each chapter is intricately woven to entertain and create suspense while at the same time giving greater insight into the messages intended for the audience.  Even though the language is simple and unambiguous, the literary tapestry fabricated is so beautifully intertwined that one cannot resist the insatiable desire to keep reading." />
