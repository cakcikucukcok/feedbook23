  <title>Family Stories (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Tessa McDermid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Why do some marriages last for decades, while others barely make it past the wedding?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Frank and Marian Robertson would tell you there&#39;s no easy answer. Love, yes, but more than that–a willingness to be &lt;em&gt;guided&lt;/em&gt; by love, to be changed by it…If Frank and Marian have a secret, that&#39;s it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When they met in 1929, they realized they were destined to spend the rest of their lives together. However, wanting a life together and &lt;em&gt;making&lt;/em&gt; one are two different things. And the obstacles they faced–parental disapproval, even tragedy–sometimes seemed too much to bear. But through it all, Frank and Marian shared a love that&#39;s lasted, a love that affects &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; in their family, right down to their great-granddaughter Hannah. She&#39;s busy planning their seventy-fifth wedding anniversary, and is doing some digging into her family&#39;s past, her family&#39;s stories. Stories that explain what shaped her family…&lt;/p&gt;
