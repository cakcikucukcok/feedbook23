  <title>The Trouble with Love - Cheri Champagne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mystery, spies, and kidnappings, all wrapped up in a regency romance novel!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trouble with Love (2nd edition) is the second regency period novel&amp;nbsp; in Cheri Champagne&amp;#39;s Amazon Best Selling Mason Sibling Series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heartbroken heroine... Lady Bridget Mason is hopelessly in love with her best friend, Major Charles Bradley. Since his return from war, however, something has changed him. He has stopped returning her letters, he gives her the cut direct, and when forced to interact with her, he is rude and downright unconscionable. Her hopes for a marriage with Charles have been heartbreakingly dashed.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The troubled hero... Major Charles Bradley is in a fix. The very same men that kidnapped his sister and her new husband a few months past have given him a warning. They are coming after Bridget. He&amp;rsquo;d done his best to keep his two identities separate, but they are determined to clash. Despite doing his utmost to push Bridget away for her protection, his love for her has been discovered by his unnervingly indomitable enemy.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Their perilous love&amp;hellip; Charles must face his greatest challenge; he must protect Bridget at any cost. But, will his love&amp;rsquo;s big secret and Charles&amp;rsquo; horrid treatment of her prove the task impossible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure to read Book 1 in the Mason Siblings Series &amp;quot;Love&amp;#39;s Misadventure&amp;quot;, ASIN: B01CDXA2S6 or ISBN-13: 978-0997135107. The next book in the series, &amp;quot;Love and Deceit&amp;quot; is due out spring of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;" />
