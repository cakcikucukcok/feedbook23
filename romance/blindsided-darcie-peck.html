      <meta name="description" content="Emily was like any other teenager.  She had plans for school, and for her life.  The thing is, Emily is really not a normal teenager.  She had been abandoned in the woods and found by a local Alpha.  She bares a mark on her arm, claiming she is from a strong Alpha bloodline.  What happens when her perfect world is turned upside down when she is brutally attacked?  What will she do when she is left blind and pregnant?
Jack is the Beta of the Silver Lake Pack.  He had set out to find his mate.  Catching a whiff of her scent, hes suddenly called back to his pack&#39;s territory to help his Alpha.  Now he is back on the road, searching for the one woman he will love for the rest of his life.  What will he do when he finds her, but things aren&#39;t as they seem?  Will he accept her or reject her for something she had no control over?" />
