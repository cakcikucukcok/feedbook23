  <title>God&#39;s Pearl of Great Price - Mohamad Rezar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The transformation of a Pearl has been taking place, and this time, it&#39;s not inside an oyster or a clam. The transformation is taking place in the Heart of Princess Mahsa.  
&lt;p&gt;
The Romance between Jonathan Elias David and Princess Mahsa Elaine Tabori, first revealed in &lt;i&gt;Language of the Heart&lt;/i&gt;, through letters that Jonathan wrote to Mahsa, continues in &lt;i&gt;GOD&#39;s Pearl of Great Price.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As Mahsa places her Love within the confines of Jonathan&#39;s Heart, the Love in his Heart has got to have a way to escape! Or otherwise his Heart would feel that it is about to explode!  
&lt;P&gt;
Jonathan finds this route of escape, through expressing the Love he feels within his Heart for Mahsa in letters.
&lt;P&gt;
In writing these letters, Jonathan lays open his Heart to Mahsa. He converses with her in the wonderful and glorious &lt;i&gt;Language of the Heart&lt;/i&gt;, expressing to her, the beauty he sees within her Heart.
&lt;P&gt;
With the first Half of the now published letters, detailing the Romance between Jonathan and Mahsa, told in &lt;i&gt;Language of the Heart&lt;/i&gt; and the second Half in &lt;i&gt;GOD&#39;s Pearl of Great Price&lt;/i&gt;, you get a glimpse of the translucent luster of the Pearl being formed in the Heart of Mahsa." />
