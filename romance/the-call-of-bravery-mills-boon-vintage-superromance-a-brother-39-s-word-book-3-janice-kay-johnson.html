  <title>The Call of Bravery (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (A Brother&#39;s Word, Book 3) - Janice Kay Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;No emotional connection means zero risk of being hurt. DEA agent Conall MacLachlan has learned that the hard way. And it&#39;s been the key to his survival. So why is his latest assignment getting to him? Could be that he&#39;s back in the town he rejected years ago. But he suspects the real reason is Lia Woods.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;s instantly and powerfully attracted to Lia–something that&#39;s never happened to him. And running a surveillance operation from her house has them too close–he can&#39;t catch his breath. Between her and her foster kids, Conall feels the domestic ties tighten…yet it&#39;s not so bad. He just needs to be brave enough to take what Lia offers.&lt;/p&gt;
