  <title>As the Eagle Flies - J. D. Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Clay Bronson is a product of the nineteenth century, half white, half Cheyenne, neither fitting into the fast pace of the twenty first century.  As an ex-Navy fighter pilot, he returns to his roots in the Big Horns of Wyoming where he joins his Father and Brother on the rodeo circuit.  Then one day their plane develops engine trouble and they make a forced landing in New Mexico where they find their counter parts on a Spanish Land Grant. This is where the story begins, as they follow the path of the Eagle, as they fly toward their destiny.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;J. D. Oliver highlights the struggle between good and evil in all his work, whether it is novels or the Cowboy Poetry he writes and performs. History, incredible knowledge of the world and the type of people who inhabit it are all present in his work. &lt;br&gt;J. D. was born in Montana, where his roots go back to the early 1800&#39;s. Both sets of his grandparents homesteaded in Montana; on his mother&#39;s side, on a dry land wheat farm in Central Montana, Highwood to be exact.  On his father&#39;s side it was on a cattle ranch in south central Montana, in the little town of Edgar, where he went to school with the Crow Indian children from Pryor, Montana.  He traveled widely in the Navy and worked in the logging industry as well as an Operating Engineer, building roads and dams. However he always came back to the homestead during winter to help feed cattle with his Dad. J. D. is married with two children, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild." />
