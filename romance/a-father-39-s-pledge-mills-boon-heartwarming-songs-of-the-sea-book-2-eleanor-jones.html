  <title>A Father&#39;s Pledge (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) (Songs of the Sea, Book 2) - Eleanor Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Can this single dad rise to the challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luke Travis may be a father, but he’s never really been a dad to Ben. When the nine-year-old enrolls at the boarding school where Luke works, Luke knows it’s time to step up. Except his son wants nothing to do with him. And then there’s Kat Molloy, the child therapist whose &quot;help&quot; conflicts with everything he believes about raising kids. Some part of him realizes they both want what’s best for Ben—and that same part of him wonders why he’s so drawn to Kat despite their differences. But Luke can&#39;t risk letting romance get in the way of his relationship with his son…&lt;/p&gt;
