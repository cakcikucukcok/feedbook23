  <title>Christmas Angels - Nancy Naigle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A heartwarming Christmas story filled with the magic and miracles of the holiday season by &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling author, Nancy Naigle.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Liz Westmoreland dreamed of taking over her grandparents inn located in the small mountain town of Antler Creek only for it to be sold before she ever got the chance. While browsing the internet, she stumbles upon a listing for what looks to be the picturesque inn and it&#39;s set to go to auction. Liz places a bid, and by a miracle, wins the auction. But when she gets there she finds the property in significant disrepair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Matt Hardy narrowly lost the inn and property that butted his land, he just hoped it wasn&#39;t another city slicker coming to make matters worse after the previous owners gutted the place for an art gallery. But the minute he recognized the sweet, freckle-faced girl from his childhood and heard her plans to reopen the inn, he jumps at the chance to help his childhood crush restore a place where he made so many fond memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While working on repairs, Liz and Matt discover her grandmother&#39;s collection of angels in one of the cabins. When the angels start mysteriously showing up all over the inn, she begins to look at them as reassurance--that restoring the inn is what she&#39;s meant to do. But when an accident leaves Liz feeling like she made a mistake, will Matt--and the residents of Antler Creek--be able to show Liz that she&#39;s found a home? And possibly true love as well?&lt;/p&gt;" />
