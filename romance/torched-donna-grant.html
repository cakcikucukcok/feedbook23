  <title>Torched - Donna Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stakes are raised and the passion burns hotter in one of the most anticipated &lt;i&gt;Dark Kings &lt;/i&gt;novel from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller Donna Grant. &lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The King of Silvers. Cunning, perceptive, resourceful. Determined. Banished from Dreagan eons ago because of a betrayal that shattered his entire existence, his sole focus in life is to exact revenge against the Dragon Kings.  A formidable fighter with centuries of rage on his side, Ulrik will stop at nothing to take down those who exiled him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has been alone, trusting no one for thousands of years. Until &lt;i&gt;she&lt;/i&gt; walks into his life. He should not yearn for her, but there is no stopping the fiercely burning attraction. When he&#39;s with her, he isn&#39;t thinking of war or revenge. He only thinks of her, craves her. Burns for her. But soon he will be forced to choose: Will he continue on his course of destruction or will he be able to set aside his vengeance to save the woman who risked everything for him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
