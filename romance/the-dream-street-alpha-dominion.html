  <title>The Dream Street - Alpha Dominion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A compelling epic story of the protagonist, a young orphan Bobby Hardcastles ascendancy from grass and common place deprivation to royalty and Kingship. Amasiri Maldini who is a co-lead character in the story is the dream lover of Bobby Hardcastle and his much sought after trophy. Life and loving came to the crossroads as internal and external forces tore them apart. Hatred and inequity consequently forces Amasiri Maldini to disappear mysteriously. Bobby Hardcastle is harassed and discriminated against as a bastard and an outcast by the immediate Enugu community. 
Violence sets in to displace love as Amanda Maldini, a bride-to-be is assassinated at the alter thus forcing Bobby Hardcastle to marry her junior sister Asandia Maldini; both of them cousins to Amasiri Maldini, before Amasiris eventual reappearance. It was Amasiri who helped him find out who was his biological father?. Was he truly a gold digger or a clever opportunist made good. 
	Mysteriously Bobby Hardcastle is chosen by the Oracle of the gods to be the next King as he is revealed as the re-        incarnation of the Lion King. He became King. How? And why?." />
