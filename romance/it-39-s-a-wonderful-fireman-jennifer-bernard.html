  <title>It&#39;s a Wonderful Fireman - Jennifer Bernard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hard-edged fireman Dean Mulligan has never been a big fan of Christmas. Twinkly lights and sparkly tinsel can&amp;#8217;t brighten the memories of too many years spent in ramshackle foster homes. Although he&amp;#8217;s established himself as one of the top firefighters at San Gabriel Station 1, he doesn&amp;#8217;t think he&amp;#8217;s good enough for someone like gorgeous Lizzie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lizzie Breen is used to fighting&amp;#8212;from her alpha male brothers, who try to smother her in the name of safety, to the life-threatening childhood illness she overcame. She knows what she and Mulligan feel for each other is a lot more than a fling, but she can&amp;#8217;t get him to see that. The only gift Lizzie wants to give him this season is her love, but he&amp;#8217;s not willing to accept it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Mulligan is trapped in the burning wreckage of a holiday store, a Christmas angel arrives to open his eyes. But is it too late? This Christmas, it&amp;#8217;ll take an angel, a determined woman in love, and the entire Bachelor Firemen crew to make him believe &amp;#8230; it is indeed a wonderful life.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
