  <title>Wanted: One Sexy Night - Judi McCoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Creative and gifted author Judi McCoy brings us the final installment in her zany and sexy Wanted trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mira, one of the nine women chosen from her planet for Project Rejuvenation, is considered perfect. She is superior in psychic skills, intelligence, objective reasoning, and has a stunning figure of course &amp;ndash; every aspect valued in her world. In order to bring their species back to its full potential, this group of perfect females will be sent to Earth, where they will mate with an Earth male and return home pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Mira&#39;s craft lands in the middle of Washington, DC, she immediately sets her sights on her quarry Lucas Diamond and seduces him to much success. Little does she know that Lucas is in charge of a highly classified organization and is responsible for locating aliens. But Mira also didn&#39;t expect that their &quot;joining&quot; would have such an impact on her emotions. Suddenly a clear&amp;ndash;cut mission has turned into something of cosmic proportions and a quest for a baby may lead to an opportunity to unite two people from two very different worlds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For anyone who has ever seen and loved Star Man (starring Jeff Bridges) and who dreams of finding the perfect man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  This &quot;Star Man&quot;&amp;ndash;like storyline is innovative, fun, and utterly charming. Judi McCoy has a fresh lively voice that is perfect for this whimsical fantasy series she&#39;s written. If you like books that make you smile, have interesting plot twists and fairy tale endings, this is the perfect read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  This is the final book in the Starlight trilogy, following three women who have come to Earth to claim their man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Judi was named Waldenbooks Bestselling Debut Author of 2001.&lt;/p&gt;" />
