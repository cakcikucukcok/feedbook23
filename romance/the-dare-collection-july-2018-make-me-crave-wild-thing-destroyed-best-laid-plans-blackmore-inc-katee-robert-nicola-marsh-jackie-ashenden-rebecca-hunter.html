        &lt;h2&gt;Introduce yourself to Mills &amp; Boon’s sexiest series yet!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make Me Crave&lt;/em&gt; by Katee Roberts&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;‘I crave you…’. Can their hunger be satisfied? &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Roman Bassani will do anything to close a deal. Even chase down Allie Landers on her Caribbean vacation to make an offer on her company. He expects a challenge—but not their immediate intense attraction. After an accidental one-night stand they agree to put business aside—for now. The island lulls them into a heated sexual journey…but what happens to their opposing interests when they return from paradise?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild Thing&lt;/em&gt; by Nicola Marsh&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She’s never been one to be tamed but he makes her utterly wild…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He used to be Makayla Tarrant’s best friend, but five years after he broke her heart, Hudson Watt is back. He’s hotter than ever – but now Hudson can make or break Mak’s dance career. She wants to hate him. She wants to show him she’s immune to his sex-appeal. But most of all, Mak wants him…every night and in every way!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destroyed &lt;/em&gt;by Jackie Ashenden&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&#39;You’ll let me do whatever I want?&#39; How can he resist…?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Why would a hot-as-hell biker put everything on the line to help the police chief&#39;s nerdy, innocent and very off-limits daughter? Simple—Summer Grant is offering Jake ‘Tiger’ Clarke something he can&#39;t refuse: her! It means playing with deliciously wicked fire, but Tiger is prepared to risk everything for what he really wants—even if it destroys them both…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Laid Plans&lt;/em&gt; by Rebecca Hunter&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A case of mistaken identity…Leads to disaster…or exquisite temptation?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;CEO Cameron Blackmore assumes the PR expert sent from New York to clean up his reputation will be a man. But Jackson McAllister is all woman—as evidenced during their no-names, strangers-in-lust, incredibly sexy one-night stand! Now Cameron and Jackson must keep their hands off each other. But with Jackson shadowing his every move in the boardroom can they forget their time in the bedroom?&lt;/p&gt;
