  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Her Unexpected Hero - Kyra Jacobs</i></b> | Her Unexpected Hero by Kyra Jacobs was a beautifully written and heartwarming read. I enjoyed watching Maddie and Cole's relationship unfold, they both had insecurities they needed to put behind them and together they were able to help each other find happiness and peace.<br /><b><i>Her Unexpected Hero by Kyra Jacobs - Goodreads</i></b> | Kyra Jacobs has a fabulous descriptive writing style. I love her smooth and interesting dialogue and her main characters are very special. Her Unexpected Hero is sweet and romantic. Because of the unfairness of what's been done to Cole and Maddie there's a nice layer of depth as well, which gives the story a good balance. Her Unexpected Hero is both charming and entertaining.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Her Unexpected Hero (Checkerberry Inn Book 3 ...</i></b> | Her Unexpected Hero 220. by Kyra Jacobs. Paperback $ 14.99.
