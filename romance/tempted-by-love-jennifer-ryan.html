  <title>Tempted by Love - Jennifer Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She was this Montana Man&amp;#8217;s greatest temptation . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alina Cooke&amp;#8212;little sister of his two best friends&amp;#8212;is the last woman DEA agent Jay Bennett should be waking up next to on the day of her brother&amp;#8217;s wedding. But their powerful attraction ignited a powder keg of desire, and their once simple friendship has just become impossibly complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alina&amp;#8217;s always been steady, focused, and lived on the safe side of life. Jay is totally devoted to his dangerous job. She knows a future with him will be filled with worry that one day he won&amp;#8217;t come home. She&amp;#8217;s done it with her brothers. She&amp;#8217;s not sure she can face that uncertainty with the man she loves. Yet being in his arms is a bad idea they keep repeating, again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Alina is run off the road, Jay fears his job has made her a target. But the threat in Alina&amp;#8217;s life is closer than they think. As the enemy gets more ruthless, Alina proves she&amp;#8217;s no easy target and Jay will do anything to bring them down. Because surviving and being together is the only thing that matters. &lt;/p&gt;" />
