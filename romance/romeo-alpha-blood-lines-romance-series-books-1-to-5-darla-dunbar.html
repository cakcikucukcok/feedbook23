      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A Paranormal Shifter Romance Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What would you do if the memory of the love of your life was ripped away forever? Will that love ever flourish again?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The road to recovery is long for the Traverse bloodline and not without its dangers. When the memory of Brody is erased from Sarina&amp;#39;s mind, he has to win her love all over again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This complete set contains Books 1 to 5&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1 - Blood Lines&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Twenty-four years have passed in relative peace for Amanda and Romeo. Romeo has made peace with the other clans and has enjoyed that peace, but it will all come crashing down around him when his oldest daughter comes of age to take a mate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2 - Alpha Infiltration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Brody is an attentive and loving mate and Sarina finds herself engulfed by the love of her family. When he shows signs of the dark void, however, she can&amp;rsquo;t decide whether to run from him or to him. She&amp;rsquo;s frightened for both of her sons and struggles with her own mortality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3 - Alpha Bait&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lilith is on the loose, plotting and planning with Fenris to take down the Delta pack and its alpha, Romeo. As Sarina and Brody dig deeper into Lilith&amp;rsquo;s past, especially where Romeo is concerned, they find a mind twisted by deception and an overly unhealthy obsession with power.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4 - Alpha Strategy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With Lilith&amp;#39;s soul separated from her body, Romeo and Amanda are bent on seeing her body destroyed so that she never comes back again. With all that&amp;rsquo;s going on though, Sarina wonders if she&amp;rsquo;ll ever be able to legally wed her mate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5 - Alpha Revelation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lilith has haunted the Traverse family since the beginning but her obsession with the reigning alpha and his immediate family is more than Romeo&amp;rsquo;s eldest daughter can stand. Digging her way up from Hell wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy, but Sarina harnesses powers that rival even those of her mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
