Yet when she looks into his coal-black eyes, it is not fear that makes her tremble...but desire. So she lies to save her life&amp;#8212;and prays to save her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though some instinct whispers that Lily&#39;s not who she claims to be, Radulf is helpless against his burning need to possess her. Furious when he discovers her true identity, he nevertheless marries her&amp;#8212;not to protect her from the king&#39;s wrath, he tells himself, but to keep a close watch on her. For Radulf was betrayed by a woman once before...and now trusting Lily could cost him his life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
