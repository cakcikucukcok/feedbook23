  <title>Handsome Killer - B. J. Loft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Sacramento, California 1989.  Leon Sherwood arrives home from high school at the end of his junior year and discovers his parents are dead. After the funeral, a court order makes him live with his aunt, Lilly Furman, who is a spinster and considers Leon an annoyance in her life. He began his senior year at a new high school and he dreamed of going to Purdue and majoring in Engineering.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Leon meets Darlene Leftish and they become lovers. When it became time to go to the senior prom, Darlene chose to go with someone else. In a fit of rage, Leon kills her.
His aunt was sure he was guilty of the murder and told the police as much. Leon kills his aunt and leaves town in her car. Over the next six years, he murders twenty-one women.
His handsome looks and charisma lure women to him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While Leon crisscrosses the country, he commits more murders. The FBI and state law enforcement agencies are hunting for him.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Charlie Evans and Rita Davis went through the FBI Academy together. Charlie helped her get in shape for the physical test. Charlie was assigned to Atlanta and Rita went to Los Angeles. Soon after, Charlie marries his fianc. When his wife gets pregnant, they are ecstatic. But the baby was stillborn and his wife died of heartbreak and cancer. Charlie resigned from the FBI, became a lawyer, and moved to Sacramento. Charlie often flew to Los Angeles on business. On one of those trips, he meets up with Rita. Rita invites Charlie to a meeting with West Coast agents that are looking for a pattern to determine where Leon will strike next. Charlie reads the map and looks at the pins that identify Leons murders. He concludes that there is no answer as to where he will strike next, but he does say that Leon will return to Sacramento.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It takes time for Charlie to overcome the loss of his wife and child, but over the following years, he and Rita become lovers.&lt;/P&gt;" />
