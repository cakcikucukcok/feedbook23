  <title>It Happened on Love Street - Lia Riley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The most romantic place she never wanted to be . . .&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Pepper Knight moved to Everland, Georgia, as step one in her plan for a successful legal career. But after this big-city gal&#39;s plans go awry, going home with her tail between her legs isn&#39;t an option. So when the town vet-and her sexy new neighbor-offers Pepper a temporary dog-walking job, she jumps at the chance. No one needs to know that man&#39;s best friend is her worst nightmare . . . or that Everland&#39;s hot animal whisperer leaves her panting.&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;The last thing Rhett Valentine wants is to be the center of small-town gossip. After his first love left him at the altar, he&#39;s been there, done that. These days, life is simple, just the way he likes it. But sultry southern nights get complicated once sparks fly between him and the knockout next door. When she proposes a sexy, secret fling-all the deliciousness and none of the prying neighbors-it seems too good to be true. And it is. Because Pepper&#39;s determined to leave Love Street, and when she goes, she just might take his heart with her . . . &lt;br&gt;" />
