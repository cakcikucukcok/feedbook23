  <title>Promise Point - Terry Newlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the dawn of the tumultuous 1960s, Toby Masters is a girl-crazy, athletic young boy growing up too fast. Fate-or something more divine-brings him to Laura DuVall in a Southern California grade school classroom. Too young to understand the full implications of their meeting, they are unaware of how completely their lives will change.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Growing up together through adolescence and young adulthood, and living the wild crazes of the times, the nascent lovers brave years filled with longing, adventure, ecstasy, and anguish in an endless struggle to defeat the tremendous forces trying to tear them apart. Yearning for a place away from the world&#39;s judgment of their relationship, Toby and Laura discover a hidden forest haven they name Promise Point, where they exchange vows of eternal devotion.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Now in college, the two are finally on their own and heading toward a fabulous future. But their dreams are suddenly shattered by events they could never have imagined. But &lt;i&gt;Promise Point&lt;/I&gt; holds the key that can save their love. Will Laura realize it in time?&lt;/p&gt;" />
