  <title>Mr. Darcy&#39;s Rival - Kara Louise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr.Darcy has learned he must prepare himself when he and his cousin, Colonel Fitzwilliam, make their yearly visit to his aunt, particularly when it comes to Lady Catherine&#39;s expectation that he marry her daughter, Anne.  This year, however, will throw in a few additional obstacles to Darcy&#39;s peace of mind with the presence of a nephew on the de Bourgh side of the family, and quite unexpectedly, Miss Elizabeth Bennet.  An interrupted proposal, a letter written and unknowingly lost, a harsh accusation, and a rival all conspire to thwart Mr. Darcy in securing Miss Elizabeth Bennet&#39;s affections when he visits his aunt at Rosings.  Will Elizabeth find the handsome and engaging Mr. Rickland more suited to her than Mr. Darcy? And will a novel she reads that was written secretly by Miss Anne de Bourgh help smooth the path to the couple finding true love?" />
