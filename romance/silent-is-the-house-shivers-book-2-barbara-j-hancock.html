  <title>Silent Is the House (Shivers, Book 2) - Barbara J. Hancock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Secrets beckon where ghosts walk.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Angelica Peters has accepted an unexpected invitation to Allen House, the Long Island mansion she would&#39;ve inherited but for a mysterious estrangement. Since her parents&#39; fatal accident, she&#39;s casting about for a safe harbor, a connection, a family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Angelica is uneasy about finally meeting Victoria Allen, the maternal grandmother she&#39;s been forbidden to see all her life. She hardly expects the warm reception she receives–from most of the household. But Owen Ward, who grew up at Allen House and has long been Victoria&#39;s heir, is keeping his distance. Maybe he doesn&#39;t trust Angelica&#39;s motives…or maybe he doesn&#39;t trust himself to be near her. Their attraction is elemental, excruciating, exquisite.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But thoughts of passion in Owen&#39;s arms become tangled with fear when a ghost haunts Angelica&#39;s every move. Is the specter an echo of the past…or an omen of black deeds yet to come?&lt;/p&gt;
