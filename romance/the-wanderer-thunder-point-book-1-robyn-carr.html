      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;From Robyn Carr, #1 New York Times bestselling author of the popular &lt;em&gt;Virgin River&lt;/em&gt; novels, comes &lt;em&gt;Thunder Point&lt;/em&gt; – the highly anticipated new series that will make you laugh, make you sigh, and make you fall in love with a small town filled with people you&#39;ll never forget.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nestled on the Oregon coast is a small town of rocky beaches and rugged charm. Locals love the land&#39;s unspoiled beauty. Developers see it as a potential gold mine. When newcomer Hank Cooper learns he&#39;s been left an old friend&#39;s entire beachfront property, he finds himself with a community&#39;s destiny in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;cooper has never been a man to settle in one place, and Thunder Point was supposed to be just another quick stop. But Cooper finds himself getting involved with the town. And with Sarah Dupre, a woman as complicated as she is beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the whole town watching for his next move, Cooper has to choose between his old life and a place full of new possibilities. A place that just might be home.&lt;/p&gt;
