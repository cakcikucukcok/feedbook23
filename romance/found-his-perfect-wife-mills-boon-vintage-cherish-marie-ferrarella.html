        &lt;p&gt;It was love at first sight for Alison Quintano when handsome stranger Luc LeBlanc saved her from a mugger. Ironically, he got hit on the head, losing his memory. When Luc awakened from the amnesia, Alison wanted to pay him back. He needed a favour, all right. For this once-spurned fiancé needed a temporary wife to make a plan of revenge complete!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So Alison bravely agreed to accompany Luc to his Alaskan hometown as &quot;Mrs. LeBlanc.&quot; But soon this marriage masquerade was stirring up too-real emotions, and Alison was uncovering the woman she&#39;d always tried to deny. Could she convince this man that true love was the best revenge?&lt;/p&gt;
