  <title>Same Time, Yesteryear - C. D. Lawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sylvia did not write the book of love, but when it come to Mickey, love is certainly strange. On Halloween night 1959, Sylvia ditched her poodle skirts and sock hops when she abandoned Mickey, to burn to death in the trunk of a wicked greaser&amp;#39;s fire streaked, &amp;#39;55 Chevy. Fifty years later, she is going to get a second chance to travel to the tender years of her past and confront the dark side of the future, if she can navigate her thirteen year old body with her sixty-three year old mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the junction of Route 66 and the Iron Railroad, Sylvia boards a majestic train which takes her back to her hometown, Hickory Springs. Our hero is transported back to that fateful night in 1959, where she quickly finds that going back in time is not as endearing as she had hoped. But Sylvia soon discovers a journal that tells the story of Iron Rose, who was also against incredible odds while riding the rails during The Great Depression. These legendary tales of faithful hobos and crooked lawmen give Sylvia the strength to battle the hot rods and leather jackets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1959 may have been the year the music died, but you can bet your bobby socks that with some help from the Father, Son and the Holy Ghost, Sylvia will not let it be the day that Mickey catches the last train for the coast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A timeless tale told in the tradition of &amp;quot;Peggy Sue Got Married meets Fried Green Tomatoes&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
