  <title>Hannah and the Highlander - Sabrina York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;First in a brand-new series from New York Times bestselling author Sabrina York about the bold, brawny men of the Highlands-and the lovely lasses who bring them to their knees...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scotland 1813:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Highlanders are her weakness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Hannah Dounreay has no time for suitors who only seem interested in her family&#39;s land, which she manages as well as any man. If she marries, she wants to be loved for the educated, independent woman she is. But when a strong, silent-and spectacularly handsome-Highlander saves her from a violent attack, her heart is stirred. Who is this man? And if he asks for Hannah&#39;s hand, will she be able to resist him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Love is the most powerful weapon of all.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Alexander Lochlannach, Laird of Dunnet, has no time to lose. The Highlands are in an uproar as clans battle for land-without mercy-and Alexander can&#39;t afford to fall for the wildly attractive, strong-willed Hannah. What&#39;s more, he has a desperate secret, one that could destroy them both. But as their attraction turns into an all-consuming passion, Alexander has no choice but to prove to Hannah that he&#39;s the only man for her-body and soul...in &lt;i&gt;Hannah and the Highlander&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
