  <title>The Feeling of Forever - Jamie Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Juliet St. Clair has spent her life under Hollywood&#39;s spotlight. While being America&#39;s favorite girl next door has had its perks, having to testify against her stalker to put him behind bars certainly wasn&#39;t one of them. But when she thinks about walking away from it all, she can&#39;t help remembering the enormous pile of medical bills her family is drowning under. Bills that just keep on coming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Felix Donovan had it all--stunning good looks, gorgeous women, and a spot as the drummer to a band that&#39;s sitting pretty at the top of the charts. Until one life-altering decision left him paralyzed from the waist down. He doesn&#39;t know whether to laugh or cry when he wins this year&#39;s Sexiest Man award, but the one thing he immediately does is send out a Non-disclosure agreement. Hiding his condition from the public is hard as hell, but he&#39;s not ready to face the world while he&#39;s still struggling to accept his new reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except this year&#39;s Sexiest Woman--Juliet St. Clair--never looks at him with pity, only desire. But falling for Juliet means a permanent spot in the tabloids, a decision Felix isn&#39;t sure he&#39;s ready to make. And when Juliet&#39;s stalker re-emerges from her past, Felix&#39;s secret isn&#39;t the only thing at stake, it could cost Juliet her life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
