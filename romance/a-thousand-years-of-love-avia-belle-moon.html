  <title>A Thousand Years of Love - Avia Belle Moon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;A THOUSAND YEARS OF LOVE&lt;/B&gt; is a historical novel set in ancient
Kyoto, Japan, and Hangzhou, China, a city described by Marco Polo as
&quot;the greatest in the world.&quot;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Join Lady Kaishi, a noblewoman of the Heian Court&lt;/B&gt;, as she
tries to find her mother&#39;s grave site, somewhere across the East China
Sea. Her search takes her from the ancient city of Kyoto, to the Temple
of the Purple Clouds, on the shores of the West Lake in China.  Along
the way her journey becomes an inner one as well, as she begins to see
the people closest to her in a new light.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;She is both observer and participant&lt;/B&gt; in the romantic
encounters of the Heian nobility, struggling to maintain her identity,
transcending gender and blood in a display as passionate and brilliant
as the silver waves glittering on her layered kimono.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;THE HEIAN PERIOD (794-1185)&lt;/B&gt;, was a fascinating era in world
history. It was Japan&#39;s aristocratic age, dominated by the &quot;cult of
beauty,&quot; and the pursuit of aesthetic ideals. Heian Kyo (City of Peace
and Tranquility), was located in Kyoto, surrounded by hills, rivers, and
mountains. Within this natural setting lived the Heian nobility, in an
atmosphere of elegance, mystery, and androgyny. It was a time when the
air was filled with the sound of Buddhist priests chanting sutras, and
the fragrance of the finest incense...where elements of Chinese
astrology, such as The Book of Changes (&lt;I&gt;I Ching&lt;/I&gt;), the &lt;I&gt;yin&lt;/I&gt;
and &lt;I&gt;yang&lt;/I&gt;, Taoism, and &lt;I&gt;Feng Shui&lt;/I&gt; were studied and practiced
in daily life.
&lt;P&gt;Heian society is perhaps best described by the most famous literary
women of the Heian Period, Lady Murasaki Shikibu, in &lt;I&gt;The Tale of
Genji&lt;/I&gt;, and Sei Shonagon, in &lt;I&gt;The Pillow Book&lt;/I&gt;.The cover shows
the eternal symbol of the yin and yang. &lt;B&gt;A Thousand Years of Love&lt;/B&gt;
explores the dramatic conflict between the masculine and feminine,
played out among the magnificent setting of the Heian world." />
