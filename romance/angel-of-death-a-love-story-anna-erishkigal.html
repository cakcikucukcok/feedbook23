  <title>Angel of Death: A Love Story - Anna Erishkigal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;hellip;for who would love Death?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Azrael Thanatos wants nothing more than to follow in the footsteps of his scientist mother. Sent to study humans on a wager between the Eternal Emperor and Shay&amp;#39;tan, he has no idea that Earth is gateway to a fiery prison. Far from home, he is befriended by Elissar, a precocious child with silver eyes. When Moloch instigates the invasion of Carthage to escape, Azrael sacrifices his life to snatch his friend from the Devourer of Children&amp;#39;s maw.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Saved by a mysterious goddess, Azrael is given a new mission. &lt;i&gt;Watchman.&lt;/i&gt; Roaming the Earth without shape or form, he reaps those who would help Moloch escape and drags them to Gehenna, a prison to which only Lucifer holds the key. It&amp;#39;s a hellish immortality, for who wants to serve alongside the Fallen or exist when no living creature can survive your touch. Haunted by Elissar&amp;#39;s death, he despairs of never finding love or friendship as time grinds civilizations into dust. For who would love Death?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then one day a child takes his hand and lives&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Life for Elisabeth is not easy. The Angel of Death took her entire family the night a drunk driver plowed through a stop sign and left her in a wheel chair. Azrael is forbidden to interfere as she bounces through foster homes, hardship and grueling rehabilitation. Then one day he is forced to reveal he is not a figment of her imagination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, how she hates this angel who has taken everyone she has ever loved! The invasion of Iraq inspires her to join the Army as a trauma nurse, unaware that Death has fallen in love with the woman who can defeat him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Will she take his hand a second time?&lt;br /&gt;
