  <title>To the Fifth Power - Shirin Dubbin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Zola Noite&#39;s nemesis killed her sidekick and forced her to watch. The guilt drove her to hang up her cape. Zola knows one thing for certain. She will never be a superhero again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Psychologist Dr. Arturo &quot;Fort&quot; Forte specializes in super-powered mental health. He&#39;s the only reason Zola can once again call herself sane-although, truth be told, the heat between them is slowly driving her back to mad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When three mega-villains escape the prison Fort oversees, all Zola&#39;s best laid plans go up in flames. Fort asks her for help, and she can&#39;t turn down the man she&#39;s secretly come to love. As battles ensue and clues add up, the one thing Zola trusts is called into question: Fort&#39;s true agenda and which side he&#39;s on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Previously released on Entangled&#39;s Ever After imprint - July 2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
