  <title>Vampire, Interrupted - Lynsay Sands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After seven hundred years of life, Marguerite Argeneau finally has a career. Well, the start of one, anyway. She&#39;s training to be a private investigator, and her first assignment is to find an immortal&#39;s mother. It seemed simple enough, until Marguerite wakes up one evening to find herself at the wrong end of a sword. Now she realizes she&#39;s in way over her head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Julius Notte wants to protect Marguerite, and not because someone just tried to take her head off. She doesn&#39;t know it yet, but she&#39;s his lifemate and he&#39;s determined to woo her. It&#39;s been over five hundred years since he last courted a woman, but surely the techniques haven&#39;t changed. Now if only he can keep her alive&amp;#8212;so to speak&amp;#8212;so they can have that happily-ever-after.&lt;/p&gt;" />
