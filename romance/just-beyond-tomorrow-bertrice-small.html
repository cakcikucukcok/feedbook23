  <title>Just Beyond Tomorrow - Bertrice Small</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Capturing the hearts and imaginations of millions worldwide, Bertrice Small&#39;s novels always deliver the lush sensuality her readers expect.  In &lt;i&gt;Just Beyond Tomorrow,&lt;/i&gt; Jasmine&#39;s strong-willed son, Patrick Leslie, continues Skye&#39;s Legacy when he takes a wife who wants no husband.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Just Beyond Tomorrow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his father dead and his mother in France, Patrick Leslie, Duke of Glenkirk, discovers the obligations of the estate and its people are now his alone. But during a day of hunting, a chance meeting ensures that he will not be alone much longer, for to obtain the deserted castle and lands adjoining his, Patrick must agree to take something else, as well--a bride.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Flanna Brodie, heiress to Brae, is as vibrant and beautiful as the Scottish countryside, and just as wild. She wants no man--only her freedom. But the passions Patrick awakens in her run deeper than those of the flesh. The independent Flanna is determined to champion the royal Stuarts&#39; cause, and restore Charles II to his throne despite her husband&#39;s objections. Patrick knows the dangers of such political intrigues; that the Stuarts have always brought misfortune to the Leslies of Glenkirk, and that a roguish king will ask far more of the na&amp;#239;ve duchess than a simple vow of fealty--forcing Patrick and Flanna to choose between the threat of wounded pride, and the promise of a lasting love both secretly yearn for.  .  ." />
