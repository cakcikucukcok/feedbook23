  <title>Chase and the Buttermilk Sky - Rose Marie Lambert DeHart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Retired police officer Chase Harlow from North Carolina receives a call from his old friend and fellow policeman, Andy Toler. Andys granddaughter,
Emily, went with some friends to a small island for one last summer fling before the start of schoolbut she never came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chase agrees to check into things and heads to the island. As soon as he arrives, he learns about the murder of a young girl. Its not Emily; as it turns
out, Emily has returned home safe and sound. Even so, Chase cant ignore his police instincts, and he decides to find out what he can about the girl who was killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night at a bar, he meets a beautiful woman named Adrian who tells Chase that she saw the murdered woman at Rainbow Island, an isolated
island far out in the Atlantic Ocean. Home to an elite private club, it boasts that it can make all your dreams come true. Chase isnt so sure about that,
but he heads out to the island to see if he can uncover the villain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What he finds, however, is romance, intrigue, and a killer who isnt going to come quietly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
