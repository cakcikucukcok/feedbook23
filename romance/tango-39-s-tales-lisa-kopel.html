  <title>Tango&#39;s Tales - Lisa Kopel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I definitely run on a different frequency than most. I dont hide behind small talk, and Ill usually go wherever my mind takes me. Tango-La can be fun, but it can also be in your face and very, very real.To make the journey one must be willing to embrace the seemingly unbelievable, and yes...sometimeseven the absurd.
Meet Tango, a middle-aged woman who is holding up extremely well. Petite and slender with red hair and green eyes, she is a voracious consumer of lifes more decadent experiences. After a four-year drought, Tango knows exactly what she wants: some purely sexual connections. In a world where nice girls should want the fairy tale (instead of just some tail), Tango is not afraid to push the boundaries and live her life to the fullest, most satisfying and pulse pounding limits.
Told in short stories, brief narratives, blog entries and advice columns, Tangos Tales is a wild voyeuristic journey into the experiences of a promiscuous free spirit and her randy, raunchy and rebellious alter ego. Now proudly dedicated to the exploration of her rapidly emerging sexuality, Tango is a force of nature. Her insight into her selection of suitors is both funny and revealing. Tangos Tales is an erotic trip with a lady feeding her hunger for that special feeling.
Tangos Tales is at once a highly erotic, laugh out loud funny, subtley emotional and brutally honest no-holds barred fictional memoir. Lisa Kopel boldly addresses sexuality, mental illness and infidelity in an often shocking one-woman show that is not for timid readers but perfect for those who enjoy erotica that cleverly blends sex and humor with refreshingly candid storytelling. 
 BlueInk Review
Female erotica lovers of any age will devour this book...Although billed as erotica, Tangos Tales provides more than sexual satisfaction for character and audience. Since one gets to know Tango as a whole person instead of just a female fueled by sex, the story succeeds at creating almost a new subgenre: erotic humor...Hopefully Kopels bold step into erotic humor will encourage other authors to join her.
