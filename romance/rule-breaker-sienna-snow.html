While she is highly respected as a philanthropist and fearless businesswoman, no one would suspect that beneath her controlled exterior simmers a private passion. A desire never spoken of in Boston&#39;s elite social circles. A need for submission, for satisfaction, for the kind of exquisite pleasure that can only be provided by one man . . . her billionaire ex-lover Maxwell Dane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  It&#39;s been five years since Max and Arya last met. Five years that they&#39;ve longed for the feel of each other&#39;s skin. Max always takes what he wants, and he wants Arya back. But it&#39;s more than the memory of her broken heart that makes her resist. During their time apart, Arya has collected secrets of her own. She can give Max her body, but can she give him the truth?" />
