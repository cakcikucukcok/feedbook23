  <title>Mike, Mike and Me (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Wendy Markham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Once upon a time in the 1980s, a girl named Beau was torn between two Mikes: did she prefer her high-school sweetheart or the sexy stranger she&#39;d picked up in an airport bar? One she eventually married, the other she left behind (and forgot all about, or tried to, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But which Mike did she choose? This delightful tale by the bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Slightly Single&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Slightly Settled&lt;/em&gt; alternates between the story of Beau&#39;s summer of Mikes and the outcome fifteen years later…without giving away which Mike ended up where–in Beau&#39;s marriage bed or in her memory.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In &quot;The present&quot; chapters, the former swinging single lives in the &#39;burbs with a childbirth-traumatized body, an increasingly distant husband and a sad sack maid who isn&#39;t much for cleaning. When out of the blue the Mike-not-taken sends her a flirty e-mail, she suddenly finds herself back to square one, trying to decide which man is the Mike of her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
