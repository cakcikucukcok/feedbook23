  <title>Saison for Love - Meg Benjamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Liam Dempsey isn&#39;t long for Antero. The bar where he&#39;s been working is going downhill fast, and it&#39;s time for him to move on. Even if moving on means moving from Colorado to Utah and leaving his sister and fledgling brewery behind. He&#39;s not interested in forming any attachments before he leaves in a month, but after a sexy hook-up with his sister&#39;s friend, he finds himself unsure where his future stands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing Ruth Colbert needs is something else on her plate. She has a restaurant to run, a chef to replace, and a cranky twelve-year-old to raise, but a steamy night with Liam was just what she needed. The only problem is, now she wants more, if only she could find the time for him. Just when things seem to be working out and she can see a possible future with Liam, someone from her past shows up to throw another wrench into everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Brewing Love series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Love on Tap&lt;br&gt;* Saison for Love&lt;br&gt;* Wild Love&lt;/p&gt;" />
