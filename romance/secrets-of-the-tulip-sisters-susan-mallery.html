  <title>Secrets Of The Tulip Sisters - Susan Mallery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;From the #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author comes the charming tale about the problem with secrets, the power of love and the unbreakable bond between sisters.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kelly Murphy&#39;s life as a tulip farmer is pretty routine—up at dawn, off to work, lather, rinse, repeat. But everything changes one sun-washed summer with two dramatic homecomings: Griffith Burnett—Tulpen Crossing&#39;s prodigal son, who&#39;s set his sights on Kelly—and Olivia, her beautiful, wayward and, as far as Kelly is concerned, unwelcome sister. Tempted by Griffith, annoyed by Olivia, Kelly is overwhelmed by the secrets that were so easy to keep when she was alone.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Olivia&#39;s return isn&#39;t as triumphant as she pretends. Her job has no future, and ever since her dad sent her away from the bad boy she loved, she has felt cut off from her past. She&#39;s determined to reclaim her man and her place in the family…whether her sister likes it or not. For ten years, she and Kelly have been strangers. Olivia will get by without her approval now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While Kelly and Olivia butt heads, their secrets tumble out in a big hot mess, revealing some truths that will change everything they thought they knew. Can they forgive each other—and themselves—and redefine what it means to be sisters?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Told with Mallery&#39;s trademark heart and humor, the Tulip Sisters are in for the most colorful summer of their lives…&lt;/strong&gt;
