  <title>Storms of Love - Mavis Kirby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is this Book About?
Letters in rhyme from a lovers view
The pain of love two lovers knew
 Youll escape with memories into their soul
As they recall all that made them whole
A book of words that will reveal
In poetic form thoughts to heal
Poems used to ease the heart
When such a strong love comes apart
This book of rhymes will relate
Tell the story of two lovers fate
Describe the anguish the two felt
While learning to accept what life has dealt
Think of the pages as letters wrote
The words of love they both spoke
A notorious love like Bonnies with Clyde
Or Romeos end when his Juliet died
A book of poems from start to finish
A tale of love and its diminish
This is not just un-associated rhyme
But words that portray a person in time
What is love but attraction and desire
What better way to describe that fire
Than poetry, a literature in verse
Love isnt planned so you can rehearse
This is what this book is about
A sensational love consumed with doubt
And all those flaws in our personality
Once hidden from us we can now see
When you cross a bridge that requires a fee
You discover this throughway is not free
 Youve taken that into account
You pay with change the right amount
This book of poems is from the soul
The words are used to pay my toll
