          &lt;em&gt;Mom Required&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before Joey, his culinary repertoire was comprised of &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; scrambled eggs, his spare bedrooms gathered dust and the &lt;em&gt;master&lt;/em&gt; bedroom seemed destined to remain mistress-less. But when his nephew became his 24/7 responsibility literally overnight, Mark Chandler knew things had to change. And he needed help.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cedar Kennedy cured troubled kids, a reputation that prompted Mark to seek out the psychologist. Ordinarily their paths never would have crossed, she the silk-and-suits-wearing doctor, he the dusty-jeans-wearing construction-company owner. But Mark knew Cedar was the one.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The one to help Joey face his fears. The one to make their house a home–if only he could get the good doctor to break her rules…and battle her &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; demons.&lt;/p&gt;
