  <title>What a Girl Wants (Mills &amp; Boon Heartwarming) (A Brookhollow Story, Book 2) - Amy Vastine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Turbulence is in their Forecast&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Summer Raines knows when it’s going to rain. She can just feel it. That’s why the local weather girl’s so good at her job. Too bad she couldn’t have foreseen the tumultuous arrival of Travis Lockwood, everybody’s favorite star NFL quarterback. Make that former star NFL quarterback. Sidelined back to Texas after an injury forced him out of his career, now the golden boy – shouldn’t he be humbled by his adversity, even a little? – is trying to steal her precious on-air time.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Summer is reduced to reporting on the weather from…football games. It’s enough to make her quit and follow her dream of becoming a storm-chaser like her parents. Except she’s got to stay put; her grandparents need her. She’s stuck with a career that’s going nowhere and a man who delights in her refusal to be charmed. Falling in love isn’t nearly as easy as predicting the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
