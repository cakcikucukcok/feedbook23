  <title>Sunday Kind of Love - Dorothy Garlock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Buckton, Indiana, 1956. As post-war America brims with new opportunities, a young woman discovers the courage to follow her dreams-and her heart . . .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Gwendolyn Foster&#39;s life seems like a dream come true. A bright future in front of her, the successful, traditional man her parents wanted at her side. What more could a girl ask for? But Gwen has a different dream altogether-to be a writer-and she won&#39;t rest until it comes true. Strong arms to support her, not own her . . . that&#39;s what she needs. And she finds them in the most unexpected of places.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hank Ellis has long been haunted by his little brother&#39;s death. He knows the entire town blames him for the accident, but it&#39;s only fitting. He blames himself too. So he&#39;s shocked when Gwen ignores the vicious gossip and befriends him. And before long, everything changes for them. Folks warn Gwen about Hank, but she knows in her heart that they&#39;re wrong. Drawn to this man of bravery and kindness who encourages her to pursue her passions, Gwen can finally envision the life she&#39;s always wanted. And with Gwen, Hank finds the strength to let go of his guilt, as he dares to hope for a future with her.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But braving the town that turns against them isn&#39;t the only challenge they face. For Hank still harbors a dark secret, a shocking truth that may force him to lose Gwen forever . . ." />
