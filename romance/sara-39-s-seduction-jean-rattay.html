  <title>Sara&#39;s Seduction - Jean Rattay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Sara Brown, daughter of Senator Frank Brown meets Nick Reardon, a notorious playboy, she is only looking to rent a shop he owns, but Nick takes one look at Sara and decides she will be his next seduction.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Sara likes Nick, but she  her father loaned her money for her needle art shop, but if it doesnt show a profit in the next five years, she must go to Washington, DC and work in her fathers office.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	  But Nick wont go away.  Sara cant avoid him because he is her landlord.  He showers her with attention.  As they get to know one another, Sara realizes Nick is much sweeter than his reputation while he realizes she has led a very sheltered life and is probably not mistress material, but neither one can walk away.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	When Sara confronts Nick with the fact that she is going to bear his child, Nick accuses her of using a baby to trap him into the marriage she knows he doesnt want and walks out.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Nick wants Sara back, but doesnt know how to tell her; her father wants her married before the media catches wind of the scandal; and Sara wants love, marriage and a family.  It wont be easy." />
