      <meta name="description" content="In this sexy page-turning tale of unexpected love, Zuri Day introduces the Morgan men, three fine brothers who have it all--except what their mama wants most for them: wives. As the eldest, it&#39;s up to Michael to pave the way. If only he&#39;d stop running from love.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the world of sports management, Michael Morgan is a superstar. But his newest client, Shayna Washington, may be his most lucrative catch yet. The record-breaking sprinter with the tight chocolate body has a talent and inner light Michael knows he can get the world to sit up and notice. She&#39;s definitely got his attention. But while Shayna may be physically strong, she&#39;s also vulnerable. And when a frightening chapter from her past catches up with her, Shayna needs someone to lean on.
