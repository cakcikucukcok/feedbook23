  <title>Anne of Green Gables - Lucy Maud Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anne of Green Gables is a bestselling novel by Canadian author Lucy Maud Montgomery. Written for all ages, it has been considered a children&amp;#39;s novel since the mid-twentieth century.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Anne is described as bright and quick, eager to please, talkative, and extremely imaginative. She has a pale face with freckles and usually braids her red hair. When asked her name, Anne asks Marilla to call her Cordelia, which Marilla refuses; Anne then insists that if she is to be called Anne, it must be spelled with an e, as that spelling is &amp;quot;so much more distinguished.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Marilla at first says the girl must return to the orphanage, but after a few days she decides to let her stay. Marilla feels that she could be a good influence on the girl and had also overheard that another disagreeable woman in town might take Anne in instead. As a child of imagination, Anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly, thriving in the close-knit farming village. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Written as fiction for readers of all ages, since the mid-twentieth century, the literary classic has been considered a children&amp;#39;s novel. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
It recounts the adventures of Anne Shirley, a young orphan girl sent to a middle-aged brother and sister who have a farm on Prince Edward Island, and who had intended to adopt a boy to help them. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The novel recounts how Anne makes her way with the Cuthberts, in school and the town. Since publication, Anne of Green Gables has sold more than 50 million copies which is a whole lot considering it was written about a redhead! It has been translated into 20 languages." />
