  <title>Christmas in Cornwall - Marcia Willett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The tender story of a boy, his father, his grandmother, and the bond they form over Christmas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;We&#39;re all pilgrims,&quot; he said thoughtfully. &quot;One way or another, aren&#39;t we? Always searching for something.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelfth night - time to put away the Christmas angel.  A new year dawns, and everything seems to be falling into place for Dossie. Her grown son Clem and his adorable five-year-old son Jakey have moved to Cornwall to be closer to her. She runs her own successful catering business. All she needs now is some better  luck in her romantic life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complementing Dossie&#39;s rather unconventional family set-up is the wonderfully eccentric Janna: a warm-hearted, generous woman who looks after the quirky nuns of the local convent  -  and little Jakey. With humour, kindness and the support of friendship, they form a tight bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Sisters&#39; life as they know it is thrown into doubt when an avaricious property developer starts prowling around their beautiful, historic home. Will this close-knit unit who so depend on each other still be together next Christmas? And what will they have learnt about the true meaning of family, and about having somewhere you really belong? Find out in Marcia Willett&#39;s touching and timeless holiday tale, &lt;i&gt;Christmas in Cornwall.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
