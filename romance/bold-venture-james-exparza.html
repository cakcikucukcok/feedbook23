      <meta name="description" content="Mark Williams must go through an agonizing and totally unexpected divorce. Quitting his job and moving back to his birth home in Buffalo Gap, South Dakota, he must resolve his divorce, and his infatuation with Alice, a beautiful Vice-principal of the local school. Alices background, which is part Native American Sioux, adds consternation to the story.  Mary, his first wife, is portrayed as a selfish, carousing individual who loses all.  The relationship between Mark and Alice adds romance, conflict, and comedy.  Dennis, the youngest son, continually adds embarrassment to Mark, Alice, and himself.  Mark eventually finds himself in an enviable position, which will enable him to develop his hybrid Bison-blend cattle." />
