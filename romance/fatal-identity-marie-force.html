            &lt;strong&gt;Every family has its secrets… &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the first anniversary of her marriage to Vice President Nick Cappuano approaches, Lieutenant Sam Holland is dreaming of Bora Bora—sun, sand and a desperately needed break from the DC grind. But real life has a way of intervening, and Sam soon finds herself taking on one of the most perplexing cases of her career.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Government worker Josh Hamilton begs Sam to investigate his shocking claim that his parents stole him from another family thirty years ago. More complicated still, his &quot;father&quot; is none other than the FBI director. When a member of Josh&#39;s family is brutally murdered, Sam begins to question how deep this cover-up goes. Is it possible the revered director was part of a baby-napping ring and that others involved are also targets?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a killer intent on deadly revenge and her team still reeling from a devastating loss, Sam&#39;s plate is full—and when Nick and their son, Scotty, take ill, is her dream of a tropical anniversary celebration in peril too?&lt;/p&gt;
