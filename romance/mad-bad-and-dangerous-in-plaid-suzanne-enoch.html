  <title>Mad, Bad, and Dangerous in Plaid - Suzanne Enoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;She used to be &lt;i&gt;mad &lt;/i&gt;about him&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Mad, Bad, and Dangerous in Plaid &lt;/i&gt;by &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling  author Suzanne Enoch, high-spirited Rowena MacLawry has come to the  Highlands after a spectacularly successful debut Season in London, and  has made it painfully clear that she&#39;s outgrown her girlhood obsession  with Lachlan MacTier. That&#39;s just fine with him, as he never had any  intention of marrying the lass anyway! Yet how can he ignore the fact  that the once rough and tumble Winnie has become a very fashionable-and  incredibly desirable-young woman...&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;And now he&#39;s got it &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brawny,  rugged Lachlan is nothing like the aristocratic English gentlemen who  pursued Winnie-with a passion-in London. Three months away was more than  enough to show her a world infinitely more glamorous than the untamed  Scottish Highlands-and her beloved childhood crush. But now that she&#39;s  decided to find a prospective husband with a bit more polish, could  Lachlan finally appreciate &lt;i&gt;her &lt;/i&gt;charms? And is it remotely possible to ignore the wild attraction she feels for him? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;One of my very favorite authors.&quot; -Julia Quinn &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
