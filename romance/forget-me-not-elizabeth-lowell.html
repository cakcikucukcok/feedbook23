  <title>Forget Me Not - Elizabeth Lowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The terrible tragedy Alana Reeves suffered on Wyoming&#39;s Broken Mountain has vanished from her memory. Now nothing remains of those six lost days that cost her everything she held dear. But a man has appeared from the shadows of Alana&#39;s past -- a rugged outdoorsman who once dwelt in a wounded heart he is now sworn to heal. Like an answered prayer, Rate Winter has come to lead Alana out of the darkness -- and back to the scene of the nightmare she has erased from her mind. Alana must follow him -- for in Rate&#39;s powerful arms her fears can be conquered, and through his love hers can be reborn.&lt;/p&gt;" />
