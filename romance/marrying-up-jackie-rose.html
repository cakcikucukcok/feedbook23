  <title>Marrying Up - Jackie Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Looking for love in all the highend places&amp;#133;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After writing her own obituary as an experiment, Holly Hastings realizes that her life isn&amp;#39;t exactly blazing a trail of glory. The twenty-eight-year-old is broke, bored at work and perpetually single. But after watching an old Marilyn Monroe movie she realizes what she can do about it: Marry a millionaire&amp;#151;and write about how to do it! This &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to be the answer to the prayers of an obituary writer who&amp;#39;s spent more time lauding other people&amp;#39;s lives than living her own&amp;#133;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking leave from her job (if not her senses), Holly decides to better her chances of mingling with the moneyed by getting the heck out of Dodge (aka, Buffalo, New York) and heading to millionaire-rich towns on both coasts. Her honesty and common decency make it hard to fully embrace the shallow life, but Holly finally lands herself an eligible millionaire in San Francisco and an all-expenses-paid trip to Easy Street. Too bad about that inconvenient crush she&amp;#39;s developed on her neighbor. Will Holly stick to her plan for &lt;em&gt;marrying up&lt;/em&gt; or will she choose marrying &lt;em&gt;right?&lt;/em&gt;" />
