  <title>Bull Hunter - Max Brand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bull Hunter by Max Brand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the old West, laws were often loosely and arbitrarily applied, so many gunslingers and cowboys took the law into their own hands and applied eye-for-an-eye justice on their own terms. The huge, lumbering outlaw Bull Hunter intends to hunt down and kill the men responsible for his uncle&amp;#39;s death. When he finds out that the ringleader is already behind bars, he devises a clever plot to spring his nemesis in order to dispense his comeuppance, street justice-style.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bull Hunter, a &amp;quot;gentle giant&amp;quot;, was ridiculed because of his size but as he grew older he became quick with a gun and partnered with the black stallion named &amp;quot;Diablo&amp;quot;. The duo are unstoppable. Brand&amp;rsquo;s lyrical writing involves the gentle connection between man and a horse&amp;#39;s spirit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bull sighed. &amp;quot;I ain&amp;#39;t got much time, partner,&amp;quot; he said. Approaching the door, he examined it wistfully. &amp;quot;But, maybe, they&amp;#39;s another way.&amp;quot; He drew back a little, raised his right leg, and smashed the heavy cowhide boot against the door. The wood split from top to bottom, and Bull&amp;#39;s leg was driven on through the aperture. He paused to wrench the fragments of the door from lock and hinges and then beckoned to Pete Reeve. &amp;quot;Look for your gun in here, Reeve.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Max Brand, was the pen name of Frederick Schiller Faust. He was a prolific American author best known for his classic western novels. Brand also created the famous character Dr. Kildare which became the basis of many films and television shows." />
