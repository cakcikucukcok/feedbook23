  <title>A Billionaire and a Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Cherish) - Marie Ferrarella</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;WILL YOU DELIVER MY BABY?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Reporter Sherry Campbell thought she might be asking too much, but her baby was coming and the only one in sight was enigmatic corporate raider St. John &quot;Sin-Jin&quot; Adair. Despite his generosity, he disliked her because she pried into the secret past he desperately wanted to hide. Lucky for her, that didn&#39;t stop the billionaire businessman from becoming her hero.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From the moment she cornered him in the elevator, Sin-Jin felt Sherry&#39;s hold on him. He wanted privacy and yet he wanted to kiss her into next year. And now after delivering Sherry&#39;s adorable son, Sin-Jin found himself yearning to become a part of her family. But would Sherry turn him away when she finally did get the scoop on his past?&lt;/p&gt;
