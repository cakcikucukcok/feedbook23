  <title>American D-Boy - Alah Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What else is there for two brothers to inherit when they come from a long line of hard core hustlers? Jason and Darius Jensen find the answer to this question as they learn to grind hard in the streets at a very young age. By chance, a high-level heroin supplier named George partners up with the brothers and loads of money begin falling into their laps. All seems well until a gruesome murder changes Jason&#39;s mind about his future. He leaves the lucrative heroin business to become DJ Jay-Roc and quickly makes a name for himself as a popular deejay. No sooner than he creates a top-rated show at the biggest Hip-Hop radio station in the world, Jason learns that the hustle is unavoidable and everything comes with a price. Darius is ecstatic to bask in what he believes is his natural talent and becomes one of the biggest heroin dealers on the East Coast. He takes on the moniker D-Boy, and like all the true hustlers in his lineage, he lives up to the title. Rich by illegal means and ruthless at heart, he builds an empire, knowing the Feds are trying to build a strong case against him. The Feds, however, become the least of his worries once he discovers someone on his team wants him just as dead as his enemies. D-Boy must exit the game before the Feds gather enough evidence to make an arrest, or enter the trap set for him by an insider and hope for a safe escape. Either scenario places death at his feet. Still, he must act swiftly." />
