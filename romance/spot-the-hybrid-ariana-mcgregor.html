  <title>Spot The Hybrid - Ariana Mcgregor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kara Evans has always been different. Freak, mutant, abomination, she&amp;rsquo;s been called it all. Half polar bear, half mouse, her animal form is a constant source of embarrassment. With her confidence at an all-time low, she&amp;rsquo;s hoping that Bearbank will be a fresh start.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Darren Young is a leopard shifter. Cool, confident, and charming, he&amp;rsquo;s never had a problem getting close to women, but those days are behind him. Tired of playing the field, Darren wants to settle down with a mate and have a few cubs. Finding the right woman would be easier if he wasn&amp;rsquo;t surrounded by so many of the wrong ones.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can Kara allow herself to be caught up with a man who could destroy the last remaining shreds of her self-esteem? A man who comes with a horde of beautiful exes?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book contains explicit sex scenes. There are no cliffhangers." />
