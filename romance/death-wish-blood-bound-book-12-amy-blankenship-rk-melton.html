  <title>Death Wish (Blood Bound Book 12) - Amy Blankenship,  Rk Melton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ren thought he&amp;rsquo;d caught him a little thief only to find that hidden under layers of boy clothes and dirt was the most desirable temptress he&amp;rsquo;d ever seen. Realizing that she&amp;rsquo;d been branded with a demon&amp;rsquo;s mark and seemed to have a death wish, Ren quickly decides that the only way to keep her alive is to not let her out of his sight. If the demons were suicidal enough to think they were going to steal her away from him, he would give them their own death wish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Getting mixed up with the underground thievery ring run by demons had been easy&amp;hellip; it was escaping them once they decided to kill her that Lacey was having trouble with. When her partner dies just to give her a head start, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t let his sacrifice go to waste and runs like a horde of demons are chasing her&amp;hellip; which they are. How was she to know that her escape route would lead her straight into the middle of a demon war and into the arms of a sexy stranger that was more powerful than her worse nightmare?
