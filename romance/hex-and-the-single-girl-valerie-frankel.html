  <title>Hex and the Single Girl - Valerie Frankel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emma sees naked people (not necessarily a bad thing!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Hutch&#39;s upscale Manhattan clients call her the &quot;Good Witch.&quot; Her uncanny telepathic abilities enable her to plant images into unsuspecting minds, which has made her New York&#39;s most successful professional matchmaker. After all, what bachelor, confirmed or otherwise, could deny his true destiny when the woman he can&#39;t seem to stop thinking about suddenly appears right in front of him? Now an all-too-perfect blonde socialite needs Emma&#39;s help to snare the most eligible single man in the city -- all in a day&#39;s work for the Good Witch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except William Dearborn -- visual artist, software genius, total hunk, and dedicated hedonist -- is not so easily snared. And he&#39;s becoming a little too interested in the desperate matchmaking sorceress who&#39;s been following him all around town incognito. Emma doesn&#39;t have to be psychic to know what&#39;s going on in his mind. William&#39;s having very wicked thoughts indeed about the Good Witch . . . and Emma likes it! But she&#39;s got to resist his special brand of magic . . . or else her witchy career is going up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;" />
