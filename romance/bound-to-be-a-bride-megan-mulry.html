  <title>Bound to Be a Bride - Megan Mulry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An exciting erotic novella from acclaimed author Megan Mulry set in Napoleonic Spain. Featuring the sensual art of Japanese rope binding, this is a fresh and intriguing spin on BDSM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seventeen-year-old Isabella (Doña Isabella de Suárez de Figueroa y Córdoba), daughter of the Duke of Feria, is preparing for her arranged marriage to the son of a wealthy aristocrat. On the morning of her wedding day, after weeks of planning, Isabella escapes from the palace, believing she is riding to freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unfortunately, after only a few hours on horseback, Isabella happens upon a small band of three gentlemen who restrain her and take her hostage. Ultimately, after they realize she is most likely a woman of privilege, they offer their assistance, as all of them are also headed to Aveiro, a port city in Portugal, to escape their familial obligations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While they are travelling, Isabella and Javier, the leader, develop a tender affection. When Javi (Francisco Javier de la Mina) insists on binding Isabella&#39;s wrists and ankles each night—ostensibly to prevent her escape or theft of their goods-the ritual soon turns into a heated game of unspoken sexual promise that is ultimately consummated when they discover their true identities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An exciting erotic novella from acclaimed author Megan Mulry set in Napoleonic Spain.
