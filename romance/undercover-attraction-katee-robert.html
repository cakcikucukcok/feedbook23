  <title>Undercover Attraction - Katee Robert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The O&#39;Malley series is one of my all-time favorites. The stories are fast-paced, gritty, sexy and downright riveting.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; Happy Ever After &lt;br&gt;  Scandal. Wealth. Power. Seduction. Welcome to the world of the O&#39;Malleys.&lt;br&gt;  Ex-cop Charlotte Finch used to think there was a clear line between right and wrong. Then her fellow officers betrayed her, and the world is no longer so black and white. Especially when it&#39;s Aiden O&#39;Malley, one of the most dangerous men in Boston, who offers her a chance for justice. The only catch: she&#39;ll have to pretend to be his fiancvee for his plan to work. &lt;br&gt;  Aiden can&#39;t afford to let anyone see the man behind the mask. To run the O&#39;Malley empire, he has to be cool and controlled at all times. But the moment he meets Charlie, they&#39;re playing with fire. Her slightest touch is enough to send him over the edge. At first their &quot;engagement&quot; was a way to eliminate his enemies. Now he&#39;ll do whatever it takes to keep her safe-- even if he has to destroy his own family to do it." />
