The only man who can help find her eloping young sister is that scoundrel Daniel Brennan&amp;#8212;the man who played with her emotions last year and then left. And he used to be a smuggler! Although &lt;em&gt;Mrs. Nunley&#39;s Guide to Etiquette for Young Ladies &lt;/em&gt;would never approve, Helena forced to go after the runaway in Daniel&#39;s company. But something about being with him feels oddly freeing&amp;#8212;and a delicious tingle warns Helena that more than her reputation may be in danger . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel finds most of the prim and proper lovely&#39;s rules ridiculous&amp;#8212;but when she insists on masquerading as his wife for the sake of appearances, he immediately envisions the delights of sharing a bedchamber. The unexpected smouldering beneath her straitlaced exterior ignites his desire, and die vulnerability hidden beneath her cool control makes him want her even more. Yet Helena&#39;s a lady, and he&#39;s the son of a highwayman. How can he ever ask her to share his world?&lt;/p&gt;" />
