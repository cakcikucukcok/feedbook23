          &lt;strong&gt;She once loved a cowboy… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Tate Walker was killed in a barroom brawl, he left his widow with a small rundown ranch in south Texas and a daughter he falsely claimed wasn’t his. Willow had accepted Tate’s proposal because Cooper Drummond, the love of her life, refused to put aside his rodeo plans, despite her fears for his safety. A year later, a cowboy appears out of nowhere, looking for work.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He’d heard about a widow who could use some help. To Willow’s shock, it’s Cooper Drummond. And to Coop’s shock, the widow is his one-time fiancée, now the mother of a little girl who’s been diagnosed with a troubling condition.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She still loves that cowboy… And that cowboy’s never forgotten her. Can the two of them—the three of them—become a family? Can Coop love her daughter as his own?&lt;/p&gt;
