  <title>A Twist Of Fate - Lisa Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When Kane Webster buys First Puget Bank, he knows he is buying trouble. Someone is embezzling funds, and the evidence points to Erin O&#39;Toole. Kane is determined to see her incriminated–until he meets her. He never expected to feel such an intense attraction to Erin–or to fall in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After her divorce, Erin has no desire to get involved with anyone–especially not her new boss. But she can&#39;t resist Kane Webster…even if she doesn&#39;t always understand his mysterious manner. Before she can help it, she&#39;s swept into a passionate affair with a man she barely knows…a man she already loves. But when she discovers Kane&#39;s suspicions, she must decide–can she stay with a man who suspects her of criminal intent?&lt;/p&gt;
