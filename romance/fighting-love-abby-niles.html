  <title>Fighting Love - Abby Niles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fighting Love by Abby Niles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk about kicking a fighter while he&#39;s down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Middleweight champion and confirmed bachelor Tommy &quot;Lightning&quot; Sparks has lost it all: his belt, his career, and now his home. After the devastating fire, he moves in with his drama-free best friend, Julie. One encounter changes everything and Julie is no longer the girl he&#39;s spent his life protecting but a desirable woman he wants to take to his bed. Knowing his reputation, he&#39;s determined to protect Julie more than ever--from himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veterinarian Julie Rogers has been in love with Tommy since she was ten, but would love to get &lt;i&gt;over&lt;/i&gt; the man. She&#39;s quiet nights at home and a glass of wine. He&#39;s clubbing all night and shots of tequila. As friends they work great. As a couple? No way in hell. She just can&#39;t get her heart to agree. When she starts spending time with another fighter, the man who&#39;s always treated her like a sister is suddenly not being very brotherly and enflames her body like never before.&lt;br&gt;Can two childhood friends make a relationship work, or will they lose everything because they stopped FIGHTING LOVE&lt;/p&gt;" />
