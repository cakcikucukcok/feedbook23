  <title>Must Love Vampires - Heidi Betts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Love At First Bite&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nightclub dancer Chloe Lamoureaux just met the man of her dreams: Aidan Raines is charming, considerate, rich, and hot. Of course, he&#39;s a little mysterious about his age. And his favorite drink. And he&#39;s not much for sunlight. But he&#39;s asked her to marry him, and she&#39;s ready to do it. Sure, she has a few secrets too--but they&#39;ll have plenty of time to work things out while they&#39;re living happily ever after. Right? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her identical twin sister, Chuck, isn&#39;t so sure. Maybe reporting for the local Bigfoot-sighting tabloid doesn&#39;t make her an expert, but to Chuck, Aidan and his brother Sebastian look like honest-to-Dracula vampires. Especially Sebastian: beguiling, seductive, and just a hint of dangerous. Maybe she wouldn&#39;t mind him taking a little taste. But with Chloe&#39;s life in the balance, she has to know--do they want hot love or hot blood? Or maybe.  .  .a little of both? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for The Bite Before Christmas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Enjoyable reading.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Inventive, gently humorous, and fast-paced, this steamy paranormal anthology offers an alternative to the typical holiday fare; perfect for readers who want their romances on the edgy side.&quot; &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;" />
