  <title>Half a World Away: a Love Least Expected - Lee E. Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Half A World Away&quot;, inspired by true events, is an International Suspense-Mystery-Romance of a man whose entire adult life becomes plagued by a series of unfortunate events, before his world begins to slowly become brighter. 
   At one time, Jared Marchal was at the top of his game.  He had the promising military and police careers he always wanted, was very well off financially, enjoyed a great marriage and later, welcomed a son on the way. 
   Beginning with a tragedy no one should endure, Jareds perfect world progressively continues to crash around him.
  Jared becomes a writer by chance, and through an act of serendipity by his publisher, he is contacted by a fellow writer, Stasia, from Russia; an unlikely heroine who attempts to tear down the massive wall protecting his heart from any possibility of disappointment, as well as  any happiness. Soon their love, a passion so newly developed, will be the only simple, uncomplicated aspect of their lives together. 
   As the intrigue begins, a volatile secret surrounding Stasia and its potential to change the world, OPEC, and war as we now know it, in addition to her fathers own military past, catapults them into an international event involving both their countries. 
   Governments, double agents, betrayal and murder all intrude among the many twists you never see coming, as they collide forward into the storys climax. The spirit of their personalities also shines as the jokes they play on one another during their times together are a welcome relief, as well as some of the funniest situations ever written.  
   Author, Lee E. Carter, through skillful adaptation of people from personal, military and law enforcement experiences, intertwines fiction and non-fiction to create the distinctive personalities and action sequences of &quot;Half A World Away &quot;." />
