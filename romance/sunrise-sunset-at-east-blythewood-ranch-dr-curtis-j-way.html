  <title>Sunrise Sunset at East Blythewood Ranch - Dr. Curtis J. Way</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sunrise Sunset at Blythewood Ranch
This is a little book that could easily have been named, Two sunrises and two sunsets of East Blythewood. The main characters are two twenty-year old college girls and an older very financially successful male, Dr. Percival Banister. The girl on the cover is Amber. She is the main character. The girl on the left here is Valerie. She is Ambers best friend and you will see how peers do affect your life in the character Valerie. The Doctor had such entanglements with Ambers mother, Veronica that she becomes the other sunset in this book. 
This little book is not broken into chapters because it all takes place in such a continual flow. However, the Author did break some segments by bold print so the reader would have a chance to pause and breathe between sex scenes. 
This little book should carry a health warning like drugs meant to help men with erectile disorders. That is, Dont use or in this case dont read this book unless your doctor says that you are healthy enough for sex.  An opened mind would also be helpful for you if you read this book. True, this book contains a lot of sex but it is not gratuitous or a book that is about sex without a lot of empirical views of the social examination of the impact of values. In this case, Amber was raised by a single mom, Veronica who once dated Dr. Banister.
At this time in our history where many of our children are being raised in homed headed by a single parent. Everyone knows that these single parent heads of house holds are mostly women. These women are many times very courageous women who sometimes work two jobs and endure many hardships. Yet, everyone also knows that most of these women, single heads of house-holds, have men in their lives. This book looks at one such case and probably overly simplifies it but the reader should be able to relate to these characters. There are no villains or victors depending on you point of view.  In some readers point of view all of the characters might be villainous or victors.  In either or both cases, the Author hopes that you will enjoy reading this book for the joy of it." />
