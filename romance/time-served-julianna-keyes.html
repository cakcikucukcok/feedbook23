I was sixteen and gloriously alive for the first time. When I felt his hand cover my leg and move upward, it was over. I was his. Forever.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Until I left. Him, my mom, and the trailer park. Without so much as a goodbye.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Now Dean&#39;s back, crashing uninvited into my carefully cultivated, neat little lawyerly life. Eight years behind bars have turned him rougher and bigger&amp;#151;and more sexually demanding than any man I&#39;ve ever met. I can&#39;t deny him anything&amp;#133;and that just might end up costing me everything.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;101,800 words" />
