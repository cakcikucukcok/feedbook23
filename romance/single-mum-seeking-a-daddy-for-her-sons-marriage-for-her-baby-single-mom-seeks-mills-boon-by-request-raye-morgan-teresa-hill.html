  <title>Single Mum Seeking...: A Daddy for Her Sons / Marriage for Her Baby / Single Mom Seeks... (Mills &amp; Boon By Request) - Raye Morgan, Teresa Hill</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;A family…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Daddy for Her Sons&lt;/em&gt; by Raye Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When bona fide playboy Connor McNair watched his best friend marry Jill Darling, he never expected a second chance with the girl who got away. But now she’s a single mother and he’s back, but it’s just business. Until Jill’s sweet smile has Connor thinking about fatherhood and forever…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marriage for Her Baby&lt;/em&gt; by Raye Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Spontaneity may be in her blood but walking down the aisle to wed a stranger is the riskiest thing Sara Darling’s ever done. But to adopt her infant niece, she’ll first need to say “I do” to ex-soldier Jake Martin. She thought she could resist his rugged charm, but before long Sara needs their ready-made family as much as he does…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Single Mum Seeks…&lt;/em&gt; by Teresa Hill&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After her divorce, Lily wanted nothing to do with men ever again. But when devastatingly handsome neighbour Nick needed help, he turned to her. The idea was simple: pretend they were a couple to keep others at bay. But as they grew closer, Lily found herself wishing for more than pretend…&lt;/p&gt;
