  <title>Escaping Rapture of Devotion - Eloise Epps MacKinnon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Escaping Rapture Of Devotion is this riveting fictional romance tale capturing the life of Ella Epstein, whose life with her Boy-Friend Rules has become like the Argentina Tango; unveiling all its twist and turns to escape the rapture in a romance that takes her by storm. 
Ella; a small-town Woonsocket girl, whos heart has had its full with men, and all those little burning emotions called love. A man was really the last thing on Ellas heart today or any day until she sights this vision of a Knight In Shining Armor, who casts his image over her blanket at the Newport Jazz Festival.  Ella is in love at first glimpse upon seeing all of this heavenly creatures glory in the flesh. Until Ella lay eyes on Gordon McNeil, she has only seen love in a romance novel or movie. However, now shes living the fairytale romance herself similar to all the ones she has ever witnessed in the flash of an eye. Only thing, Ellas new-found love, she finds hard to deal with. Ellas spinning out of control; shes in a state of frenzy, doing all sorts of things in the name of love!
Never in her wildest dreams would Ella ever imagine going home so happy. Ella has, what her friend would call, the brass ring on the merry-go-round of life from the Newport Jazz Festival. Her eyes and heart are in love at first image with this stranger who set her world aflame. Ellas never known any man who made her thirst for him so greedily, the way this man does without a touch or words. Until the night intrusion of its phone number fiasco, which tears Ellas heart apart from him too soon; while this evening was still young for them both. After several weeks of agonizing over her loss of Aaron, a little trusty work of one PI and two trusted friends helps Ella reunite with Aaron in a flaming bond of love; even stronger than before! Ella knew all her prayers had been answered through her love and faith in a trusting God!" />
