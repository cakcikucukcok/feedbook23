  <title>Paul&#39;s Two Mothers - Dyan Taleyithe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Paul is an adopted teenager who seeks out his birth mother to find answers about who he is. His mother provides those answers and more, and Paul finds that his feelings for her stretch beyond the mere filial! At first wary of this, but then he finds that his mother&amp;#39;s feelings towards him are more than just maternal. They engage in a wild and passionate affair. Then, Paul&amp;#39;s other mother finds out about them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;I was on the internet the other day and I read this article about something called GSA. Ever heard of it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was part of my plan, you see, to gently get us to both admit to the feelings we had for each other. But Paul&amp;rsquo;s body language changed, became secretive as he answered, &amp;ldquo;No, mum, I haven&amp;rsquo;t.&amp;rdquo; he said and I knew he was lying.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; I went on, moving a little closer to him and noting that his trousers were starting to tent a little &amp;ndash; sure you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it! &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s about people like us. You know, family members who weren&amp;rsquo;t brought up as a family and who met later on.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;OK&amp;rdquo;, Paul said, his breathing a little faster than normal. I recognised the signs. He&amp;rsquo;s thinking he might &amp;lsquo;get lucky&amp;rsquo; tonight. It reassured me. If he felt that way, both of us would be getting lucky.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Apparently, in those situations, the people involved &amp;ndash; and it can happen to any family combination, father-daughter, sister-brother, mother-son &amp;ndash; apparently they can end up feeling attracted to one another. You know, romantically&amp;rdquo; I said, shifting my position so that my skirt hiked up a little, exposing some of my upper thigh, &amp;ldquo;Sexually, even. Have you ever had feelings like that, honey?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul shifted his position, I think to hide his growing erection. His breathing was faster now, and I think he was considering his options. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad he chose honesty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, mum,&amp;rdquo; he replied, staring me straight in the face, &amp;ldquo;I have had feelings like that about you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, there it was, out in the open. I was so pleased that my beautiful boy had come clean at last. And I wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to leave him hanging. &amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s OK, honey, it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly natural. I&amp;rsquo;ve had similar feelings like that about you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You have?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You sound surprised. You&amp;rsquo;re a tall, handsome, gorgeous young man.&amp;rdquo; I let my hand rest on his thigh, accidental-like. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;d have to be made of stone not to find you attractive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
He was embarrassed, but also really turned on, I could sense it. &amp;ldquo;Well, that&amp;rsquo;s true of you, too, mum. You&amp;rsquo;re a beautiful woman. It&amp;rsquo;d be hard for me not to feel, you know&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I leaned forward towards him, looking him in the eyes &amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip;sexually attracted.&amp;rdquo; I finished for him. And he looked back at me and I looked at him and our heads moved closer and closer together&amp;hellip; and eventually, they met, and I felt his lips on mine, his arms wrapping themselves around me and I surrendered to the passionate embrace of my son." />
