But marrying him would have meant leaving the only home she&amp;#39;d ever really known. So instead of following her high school sweetheart to L.A., she stayed on at his family&amp;#39;s ranch, training the horses she adored. Zack never knew about the secret she carried&amp;#133;or how much she still loved him. Until a near-tragedy brought him home again&amp;#133;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fifteen years ago, Jenny broke Zack&amp;#39;s heart. Seeing her again rekindles all the sweet passion they once shared. But Zack came home to Miners Bluff only to deal with a family crisis&amp;#151;then he&amp;#39;s pulling up stakes again. So why is Jenny making him dream of settling down in the one place he&amp;#39;d vowed to leave forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
