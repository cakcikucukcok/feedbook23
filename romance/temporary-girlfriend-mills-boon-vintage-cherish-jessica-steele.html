          &lt;strong&gt;Should his every wish be her command?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What choice did Elyss have but to put up with Saul Pendleton calling the shots? Because of a series of dreadful mistakes, she owed him a whole lot of money and hadn&#39;t a hope of being able to pay him back. However, if she signed up with Saul&#39;s personal loan scheme and became his date for every social occasion, then all her troubles would be solved. Or would they?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It soon became apparent that Saul expected interest on his loan–but did he want a temporary girlfriend or a permanent wife?&lt;/p&gt;
