  <title>Nico&#39;s Guilt - Kt Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nico Tribiani sighed as he put down the last picture. It already seemed as if the wedding was a long time ago. His best friend and ex-partner on the Dallas Police Department Luke, had married, settled down and moved to Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His girlfriend, Sherri had been murdered by the same killer who had terrorized Luke&amp;rsquo;s wife, Shannon, all those months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The guilt of feeling like it was all his fault for not paying enough attention to her, ate at his gut on a daily basis. He looked at the bottle of whiskey and noticed it was almost empty. Well that was okay, he patted his shirt pocket, he was almost out of cigarettes, too. He&amp;rsquo;d just go and get some more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phone rang and he ignored it, as he had been doing a lot lately. It was probably Luke or Shannon again. They had been trying to get him to come visit them in Louisiana. He knew they were worried about him. Hell, sometimes he was too.&amp;nbsp; But he just wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready. He felt like he needed more time alone, although he knew he would have to rejoin the living sooner or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the answering machine came on, it took him a few seconds to realize it wasn&amp;rsquo;t Shannon&amp;rsquo;s voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nico, listen.&amp;rdquo; The voice was speaking quietly, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m in trouble,&amp;rdquo; she paused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing his little sister&amp;rsquo;s voice, Nico lurched to answer the phone. &amp;ldquo;Toni?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sighing with relief Antoinette laughed a little shakily. &amp;ldquo;HI! I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you&amp;rsquo;re home. I just found this old pay phone. I need you to come to New Orleans -&amp;nbsp;tonight. I hate to ask but I&amp;hellip; Oh God!
