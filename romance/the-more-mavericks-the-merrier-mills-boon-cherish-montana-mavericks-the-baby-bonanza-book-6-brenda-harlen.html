  <title>The More Mavericks, The Merrier! (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Montana Mavericks: The Baby Bonanza, Book 6) - Brenda Harlen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;We here at The Gazette just love a happy ending, and if anyone needs a little Christmas, it’s Jamie Stockton. The stoic rancher has been raising his triplet babies alone since his wife died. Thanks to Rust Creek Falls’ volunteer “baby chain,” Jamie has had many helping hands. But his bed is still empty, and so is his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Could family friend Fallon O’Reilly be the one to brighten his holiday? Babies Henry, Jared and Kate surely love having Fallon around, but their lonely dad may take a little more convincing. Hang the holly, dear readers, and deck the halls as our cautious cowboy rediscovers his Christmas spirit—and the “girl next door” gets a present she will never forget!&lt;/p&gt;
