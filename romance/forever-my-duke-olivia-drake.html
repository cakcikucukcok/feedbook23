She&#39;s the opposite of what a man of his high rank should desire in a wife--an outspoken American who has never even set foot in a London ballroom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Natalie doesn&#39;t have time to be swept off her feet by a handsome duke who must be a spoiled scoundrel like every other British lord. And she couldn&#39;t care less about Hadrian&#39;s title. After all, it&#39;s not as if he actually &lt;i&gt;worked &lt;/i&gt;to attain his wealth and status. He surely can&#39;t understand what it&#39;s like to be a busy woman, planning to open a school while trying to reunite a six-year-old orphan with his English relatives. Nevertheless, Hadrian launches his campaign to win her heart. Can the utterly delightful American beauty ever find a way to love him...despite his being a duke?&lt;/p&gt;" />
