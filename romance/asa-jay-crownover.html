  <title>Asa - Jay Crownover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jay Crownover&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;USA Today &lt;/em&gt;bestselling Marked Men series continues with the much anticipated story of southern charmer and certified criminal Asa Cross.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting over in Denver with a whole new circle of friends and family, Asa Cross struggles with being the man he knows everyone wants him to be and the man he knows he really is. A leopard doesn&amp;#8217;t it change its spots and Asa has always been a predator. He doesn&amp;#8217;t want to hurt those who love and rely on him, especially one luscious arresting cop who suddenly seems to be interested in him for far more than his penchant for breaking the law. But letting go of old habits is hard, and it&amp;#8217;s easy to hit bottom when it&amp;#8217;s the place you know best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Hastings is quickly learning what the bottom looks like after a tragic situation at work threatens not only her career but her partner&amp;#8217;s life. As a woman who has only ever had a few real friends she&amp;#8217;s trying to muddle through her confusion and devastation all alone. Except she can&amp;#8217;t stop thinking about the sexy southern bartender she locked up. Crushing on Asa is the last thing she needs but his allure is too strong to resist. His long criminal record can only hurt her already shaky career and chasing after a guy who has no respect for the law or himself can only end in heartbreak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A longtime criminal and a cop together just seems so wrong . . . but for Asa and Royal, being wrong together is the only right choice to make.&lt;/p&gt;" />
