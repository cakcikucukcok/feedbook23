      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;This [is a] page-turning novel full of historical details and sensuous romance.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s noble. notorious. And takes no prisoners...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong as a Viking. Handsome as Adonis. Rich as Midas. Collin &quot;Cole&quot; Talmage, Duke of Trewyth, is the stuff that legends are made of.  He&#39;s the English Empire&#39;s golden son--until fate has its way with him. Cole&#39;s family is killed and his closest comrade betrays him on the battlefield, leaving him gravely injured. But Cole is not one to dwell on misfortune. He is a man of duty, honor--and desire. And now he&#39;s ready for the fight of his lifetime...&lt;br&gt;Imogen Pritchard is a beautiful lass who works in a hospital by day and as a serving maid at night. Years ago, when she was young and penniless, she ended up spending a scandalous night with Cole, whose tormented soul was matched only by his earth-shattering passion. Imogen entered a marriage of convenience--one that left her a wealthy widow--but she never forgot Cole. Now that her long-lost lover has turned up in her hospital, injured and with no memory of her, Imogen is torn: Is it a blessing or a curse that their past remains a secret to Cole, even as his new passion for her leaves him wanting to protect and possess her...at all costs, in &lt;i&gt;The Duke, &lt;/i&gt;the next &lt;i&gt;Victorian Rebels &lt;/i&gt;novel by Kerrigan Byrne.&lt;/p&gt;" />
