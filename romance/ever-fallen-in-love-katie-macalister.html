  <title>Ever Fallen in Love - Katie MacAlister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;One man and a baby was all it took&amp;hellip;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When sexy, bad-to-the-bone Greek playboy Theo Papaioannou finds himself in possession of a son he didn&amp;rsquo;t know he had, he has to overcome a lifetime of bad choices, and become the father his son deserves&amp;hellip;assuming he can figure out how to change a diaper. It&amp;rsquo;s just lucky that Kiera Taylor is there to help&amp;hellip;or it would be if she wasn&amp;rsquo;t keeping some dangerous secrets from him.&lt;br /&gt;
Kiera is on the run from a violent man who has threatened her more than once. And although she knows she shouldn&amp;rsquo;t trust Theo&amp;rsquo;s handsome dark looks, or his winning smile, or the way he makes all her good intentions melt, she has no choice. For somehow, she&amp;rsquo;s fallen for him and his adorable baby. Desperate for a happy future with them, she makes a deal with the devil, one that risks everything&amp;ndash;and everyone&amp;ndash;she loves.&lt;br /&gt;
