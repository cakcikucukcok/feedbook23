But Dirk only has eyes for a dazzling rodeo queen. How can Janice ever compete while mired ankle-deep in manure? Exchanging playful banter with Dirk is all Janice can expect-until the stormy night he knocks on her door dripping wet and needing a place to crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daring to dream again...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dirk Knowlton is living the cowboy dream. Life should be good-roping, branding, bucking broncs, riding bulls-but there&#39;s a void he can&#39;t seem to fill. After getting hung up by a bull, he wonders if this is really the life he wants. Restless and rebellious, he joins the Marines determined to prove himself...but there&#39;s a certain cowgirl he can&#39;t forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a battle-scarred Dirk returns to his Montana ranch he finds Janice has come back home to lick her own wounds.
