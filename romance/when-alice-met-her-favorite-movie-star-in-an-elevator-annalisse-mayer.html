  <title>When Alice Met Her Favorite Movie Star in an Elevator - Annalisse Mayer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With &lt;i&gt;When Alice Met Her Favorite Movie Star in an Elevator&lt;/i&gt;, Mayer invites you to curl up in your armchair and join her in her private escape: a fantasy life full of romance and personal fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;When Alice &lt;/i&gt; departs from the usual premise that romance only occurs between young people or that only young people are interesting to read about. Middle-aged people, too, have dreams and passions.&lt;/p&gt;
One of Annalisse Mayer&#39;s dreams is to meet and get to work with her favorite movie star. &lt;i&gt;When Alice &lt;/i&gt; allows you to explore this dream with Mayer, following the working relationship into both an offbeat love affair-not at all for the prudish-and an insightful view of how a dream career can become chronic overwork.&lt;/p&gt;
This book was inspired by some of Annalisse Mayer&#39;s personal fantasies about a real movie star. Maybe, when you&#39;re reading this, you&#39;ll guess who he is; however, his name has been changed to emphasize that this could be any movie star, including your favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
Annalisse Mayer has an ongoing interest in disorders on the autistic spectrum, because of her own family experiences. True to her interest, she has added two characters in this novel who are on the spectrum. Learn more about such people, by enjoying their interactions with the heroine, Alice, and her movie star, Gem." />
