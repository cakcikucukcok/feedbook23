Jenny Tolliver&#39;s been the good girl all her life, and it&#39;s gotten her nowhere. Now that her marriage has been busted up by her cheating ex, she&#39;s decided it&#39;s time to regroup and rediscover herself. This summer she&#39;s headed back to her hometown of Destiny, Ohio, to the very lakeshore cottage where she grew up, to figure out what life holds in store for her next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She never dreamed the answer would be Mick Brody, Destiny&#39;s #1 hellraiser. He comes from the wrong side of the tracks (or in his case, the lake), and he&#39;s landed in hot water more times than he can count. He&#39;s exactly the kind of guy Jenny&#39;s always kept her distance from . . . but soon the good girl and the bad boy are caught in a raw heat that&#39;s out of control. Too bad Mick&#39;s got a secret that threatens to tear them apart and ruin Jenny&#39;s perfectly, passionately reckless summer . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
