&lt;br /&gt;
A dark secret that involves Brody can unravel the love of his life. How can Sarina prevent the evil from ruining their lives?&lt;br /&gt;

Sarina loves her family. She enjoys their company and knows that she is truly loved and adored. Her brothers would walk over hot coals to protect her and show it at every turn. At the rate they&amp;rsquo;re going, she&amp;rsquo;ll spend her life being watched over. Mate or no mate, she suspects they don&amp;rsquo;t care.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Having chosen the reality that spoke most heavily to her heart, Sarina is enjoying her pregnancy. Brody is an attentive and loving mate and Sarina finds herself engulfed by the love of her family. When things start to change with the twins though, Sarina finds herself torn in two. She loves Brody in a way she&amp;rsquo;s never loved another man, human or wolf. When he shows signs of the dark void, however, she can&amp;rsquo;t decide whether to run from him or to him. She&amp;rsquo;s frightened for both of her sons and struggles with her own mortality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can Sarina put everything to rights before Brody, the man she loves, turns into someone else entirely? Old loves, new loves, and loves lost all clamor for attention in this tantalizing sequel to Blood Lines.&lt;br /&gt;
