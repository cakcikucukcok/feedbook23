      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A passion more than skin deep&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Moving from Colorado to a seaside California town was a risky career move. But it could be the opportunity of a lifetime if Liza Sinclair can snag the plum job of designing a private clinic for America’s plastic surgeon to the stars. All she has to do is beat out the competition by impressing Anthony Marbet with her innovative designs . . . and keep her attraction to the gorgeous physician from derailing her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The lovely architect has beauty and a vision that coincides with Anthony’s plans for his growing practice and the exciting expansion going on in Bay Point. His love life may be a work in progress, but Liza tempts him to take their strictly-business relationship to the next level. Can he create a blueprint for the future with the woman who fulfills his ideas of perfection—inside and out?&lt;/p&gt;
