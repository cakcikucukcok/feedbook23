  <title>Gone With the Rogue - Amelia Grey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A powerful handsome rogue finally meets his match in &lt;i&gt;Gone With the Rogue&lt;/i&gt;, the second book in the First Comes Love series from bestseller Amelia Grey.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;She had an acceptable marriage of convenience. Now widowed, can this determined and beautiful mother find true and forever love?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sinking of the &lt;i&gt;Salty Dove&lt;/i&gt; took her husband&#39;s life--but it didn&#39;t drown Julia Fairbright&#39;s courage to endure. She creates a proper life for herself and her young son. But now, the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s most notorious rogue is back, and how he makes Julia feel is anything but proper. She can&#39;t deny the desires he awakens in her, even though she knows that the handsome devil will surely break her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garrett Stockton owns a successful shipping company and is rumored to have a woman on every continent and half-a-dozen in England. The truth, however, is that Garrett has but one mistress: the wide open sea. That is, until he meets Julia, whose spirit of independence matches his own. What begins as a flirtatious battle of wits turns far more passionate than either of them could have imagined. Suddenly, Garrett&#39;s only desire is to sail into the sunset with Julia as his wife and young Chatwyn his son. But she won&#39;t take his hand--how can he convince her that his love is real and his heart is hers?    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A master storyteller.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Affaire de Coeur&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
