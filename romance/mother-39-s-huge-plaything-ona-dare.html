  <title>Mother&#39;s Huge Plaything - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My mother never seems to age. As in the Picture of Dorian Gray, she must have sold her soul and has a portrait hidden somewhere that is taking on her years. We cannot go anywhere together that people don&amp;rsquo;t comment on what a good looking &amp;ldquo;couple&amp;rdquo; we are. I always thought it was a compliment to my mother, and it is, but tonight she seems anything but my mother. And she&amp;#39;s fucking hot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Care to dance, Mother?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, I would. I&amp;rsquo;ve been besieged with men, both married and single, and I&amp;rsquo;m just not in the mood to smile for them anymore. I&amp;rsquo;ll just write a bigger check than I had anticipated and that should make up for leaving early. But one last dance with the most eligible and handsome man here tonight is definitely something I don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss. Come, let&amp;rsquo;s trip the light fantastic,&amp;rdquo; she smiles almost seductively.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The dance floor is crowded, there is hardly room to move. But photo flashes are still popping and everyone continues jostling for position to be seen and photographed at the most popular charity ball of the year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re dancing closely and the smell of her perfume is driving me mad. She&amp;rsquo;s so warm and inviting and my cock can&amp;rsquo;t resist. It&amp;rsquo;s getting hard and when a couple behind us bumps me into her, her eyes get big and her breathing catches. &amp;ldquo;Why, darling, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know,&amp;rdquo; she says, finally resuming her fa&amp;ccedil;ade, her impish grin adorable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s nothing, Mother. Just all the pheromones in the air, that&amp;rsquo;s all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Still&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Still what?&amp;rdquo; I ask, quirking an eyebrow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nothing, nothing. Are you ready to go?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I thought you&amp;rsquo;d never ask,&amp;rdquo; I say with a smile.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I place my hand at her lower back and guide her through the crowded dance floor. When we are almost free of the crush, I let my hand drop a little and linger on her perfect ass. I get her cloak from coat check, and we&amp;rsquo;re off." />
