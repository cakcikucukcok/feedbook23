          &lt;strong&gt;BABY BOOM&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;A daddy for Christmas…&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sensible Lowri had no intention of succumbing to Adam Hawkridge&#39;s careless charm. But Adam persisted, Lowri resisted–and gave in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Loving Adam had its price–soon Lowri was expecting his baby. He proposed marriage but Lowri knew his heart just wasn&#39;t in it. So she jilted him at the altar, pretending her pregnancy was a false alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Two years later, and Lowri was looking forward to spending Christmas with her pride and joy–little Rhosyn. But the festive season would bring with it a series of surprises and shocks–not least that Adam Hawkridge was about to discover the existence of his daughter!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;BABY BOOM. Because two&#39;s company and three&#39;s a family!&lt;/strong&gt;
