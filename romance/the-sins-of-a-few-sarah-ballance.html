  <title>The Sins of a Few - Sarah Ballance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Salem, 1692&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moment he steps off the boat and into his hometown of Salem, Nathanial Abbot knows the rumors about Salem are indeed true. For in the two years since he&#39;s left Salem--disowned by his family and seeking a fortune of his own--the town has changed. It is dark with discord and suspicion... and accusations of witchcraft. Now all that remains for him is the woman he&#39;s never forgotten.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Faith Downing isn&#39;t happy to see Nathanial. In his absence, his younger sisters have ignited the chain of hysteria that resulted in twenty deaths--including Faith&#39;s aunt, to whom Nathanial owed his life. Yet through her acrimony, Faith can&#39;t prevent herself from responding to the man Nathanial has become, handsome and kind. A man who kindles something in her that speaks of &lt;i&gt;sin&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Sins of Salem series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Her Wicked Sin&lt;br&gt;* An Unexpected Sin&lt;br&gt;* The Sins of a Few&lt;/p&gt;" />

Ive been looking forward to reading this book because I wanted to see how the author wrapped up the series. I was especially interested in learning if the troublemakers received their comeuppance! This is Nathanials and Faiths story. For me, it is a story of love lost and rediscovered.<br /><b><i>The Sins of a Few (Sins of Salem #3) by Sarah Ballance</i></b> | Sins of a Few is the last book in the Salem series by Sarah Ballance. This is the final book in the Salem series and in this one you see some of the brief connections that were made in the others. And while there weren't a lot of them in this book which allowed it to be a stand alone, there were enough that as a reader who has read the first two I was pleased with them.<br /><b><i>The Sins of a Few (Sins of Salem Book 3) - Kindle edition ...</i></b> | The NOOK Book (eBook) of the The Sins of a Few by Sarah Ballance at Barnes &amp; Noble.
