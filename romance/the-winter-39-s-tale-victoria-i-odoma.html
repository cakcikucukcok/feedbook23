  <title>The Winter&#39;s Tale - Victoria I. Odoma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set in ancient times, two souls unite but their love and loyalty are tested. War is approaching and the finest warriors are assembled. She had led many battles alongside her father and it has made her the woman whom she was. Frivolous matters like love do not concern her but when love hits her, it becomes harder to hold on than she thought.     Sent on a mission that could cost her life, she disguises herself as a male to avoid attention from the enemy. Meeting unplanned circumstances on her journey, secrets are unravelled as ego and power clash just like the swords in battle.     Within the enemy&#39;s walls, she also battles but this time she battles the matters of the heart." />
