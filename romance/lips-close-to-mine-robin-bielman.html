  <title>Lips Close to Mine - Robin Bielman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I wasn&#39;t supposed to see Levi Pierce ever again. A few months ago, we had one incredible date. One. That&#39;s how I like it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;End of story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only it wasn&#39;t. Pretty soon everywhere I turn, I see him. Our best friends are dating. My mother mistakenly--and happily--thinks he&#39;s my plus-one to my cousin&#39;s wedding. And he&#39;s the guy I have to work with on the most important job opportunity of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s my problem: I like Levi. I like his killer smile, his dreamboat eyes, and definitely the way he makes me feel. But I&#39;ve sworn off relationships. So when the sexual tension reaches epic proportions, I tell myself it&#39;s temporary. When I start to feel more, I tell myself it&#39;s over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Levi isn&#39;t a forget-it kind of guy. When his lips are close to mine, and he swears he&#39;s always wanted me, my defenses disappear. But he&#39;s heading off to new adventures an ocean away, and some things in life just aren&#39;t meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Wherever You Go series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Talk British to Me&lt;br&gt;* Lips Close to Mine&lt;br&gt;* Too Hard to Resist&lt;/p&gt;" />
