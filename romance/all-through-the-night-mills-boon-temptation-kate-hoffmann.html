  <title>All Through The Night (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - Kate Hoffmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She wanted one night&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nora Pierce needs to get a life–a sex life. She hasn&#39;t had a single relationship since she took over writing as Prudence Trueheart, the newspaper&#39;s stuffy etiquette columnist. So she decides to do something Prudence would never dream of–don a disguise and seduce the first gorgeous guy who crosses her path. Only, that guy turns out to be the one man Nora can&#39;t have… &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;He wanted forever&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sports writer Pete Beckett doesn&#39;t know what game Nora&#39;s playing, but he&#39;s definitely enjoying it! After all, he&#39;d spent months trying to connect with his sexy, uptight co-worker. Now she&#39;s suddenly setting his sheets on fire every night–and pretending to be somebody else during the day. But Pete knows exactly who he has in his bed–and he&#39;s intending to keep her there indefinitely…&lt;/p&gt;
