  <title>Irrepressible Jasmine - Sami Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Aaron Sanderson has wanted Jasmine Campbell since high school, but as a teen, he didn&#39;t stand a chance. Ten years have passed, and Aaron has all the confidence he needs to deal with the opposite sex. He figures he knows just how to get to Jasmine too--with an aloof demeanor and a firm hand--he just never realized how firm she&#39;d want that hand to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jasmine&#39;s back in Leyton&#39;s Headland and determined to make up for past mistakes by keeping her sister&#39;s business afloat. For that, she needs Aaron&#39;s help. A fun, vanilla fling might be just what she needs to cleanse her sexual palate after an affair with a Dom turned sour. Before long, she and Aaron are steaming up the sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once acknowledged, some cravings can&#39;t be denied, and when Jasmine confesses her submissive desires to Aaron, he proves himself to be surprisingly adaptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each story in the Wild Crush series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed in any order. &lt;br&gt;Series order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1: Unforgettable Summer&lt;br&gt;Book #2: Irrepressible Jasmine&lt;br&gt;Book #3: Eternal Brand&lt;br&gt;Book #4: Imperfect Penelope&lt;br&gt;Book #5: Unbreakable Hope&lt;/p&gt;" />
