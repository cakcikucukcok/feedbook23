  <title>Unrequited - Paige Romero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="(Center) Another sad heartbroken man.
He was the man with sad eyes.
Living as a supreme artist in the drizzly city of Portland Oregon, twenty-two year old John Watson is a man who wants to believe that one can be truly happy. Due to his ugly history and sudden break-up with the love of his life, he is left hopeless and finds himself sinking back into depression. 
But its not long until John discovers someone who could turn his lonely little world upside down. Although the newly found feeling is electrifying and real, the cold dark past still leaves scars on his heart, causing him not to get too close, for John knows that love in return is impossible.
People eventually give up sooner or later, right? 
As John slowly begins to recollect the fragments of his old, happy self, disaster strikes, and he reaches his breaking point. When it seems as if Johns whole world is crumbling to pieces, he is doing his best to hold it together. 
But when life gets heavy, things will fall apart." />
