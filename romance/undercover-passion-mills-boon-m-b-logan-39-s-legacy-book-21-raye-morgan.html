  <title>Undercover Passion (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (Logan&#39;s Legacy, Book 21) - Raye Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Follow a handsome detective as he searches for the truth…and finds his soul mate.&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Detective Daniel O&#39;Callahan didn&#39;t like mysteries, so when half the staff at Portland General was in love and kissing in the hallways, he smelled a rat. No sooner had he launched Operation: Aphrodisiac than pretty PR expert Abby Edwards had him wondering if the love bug was contagious. He wasn&#39;t in the market for a wife and he had to maintain his distance, especially since Abby might be the key to solving the case. But with her sweet smile and passionate kisses, Daniel knew he was in deep–and that sooner or later he&#39;d have to choose between justice and the woman of his dreams….&lt;/p&gt;
