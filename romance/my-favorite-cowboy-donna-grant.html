      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;bestselling author Donna Grant rounds up the hottest cowboys in Texas in her latest novel of no-holds-barred passion.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Audrey Martinez is a veterinarian who has devoted her whole life to the care and protection of horses--even if doing so leaves her little time for meeting a man. Who would have thought that a strange case of criminal horseplay would lead her to falling deeply, wildly in love? If only the man who makes her heart race faster than a wild mustang would let his guard down, that is. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caleb Harper is no ordinary cowboy. Sure, he wears his hat, boots, and jeans like a second skin, and displays an easygoing charm that comes from years of working on the ranch. But with his military background, and Army buddies at his side, he is tried-and-true Texas tough. Audrey knows she can trust a man like Caleb to help her save horses. But can Caleb trust himself to resist his attraction to Audrey--or will the sparks of their desire end up getting them burned?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A fantastic, first-class Lone Star romance.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;--RT Book Reviews &lt;/i&gt;(Top Pick!) on &lt;i&gt;The Christmas Cowboy Hero&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
