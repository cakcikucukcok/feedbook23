      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Twilight, Texas Novella &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valentine&amp;#39;s Day can be a real disaster &amp;#8230; even in a town like Twilight, Texas!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These days, event planner Sesty Snow is no fan of hearts, flowers, or goo-goo eyes over dinner. She&amp;#39;s learned to be in control of her life and her emotions. Still, running Twilight&amp;#39;s annual Valentine&amp;#39;s Day bachelor auction is right up her alley&amp;#8212;until her high school sweetheart zooms back into town. He&amp;#39;s still heart-stoppingly handsome, but it&amp;#39;s clear he hasn&amp;#39;t changed the daredevil ways that put the brakes on their first love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injured NASCAR driver Josh Langtree isn&amp;#39;t up for being anyone&amp;#39;s sweetheart these days either. He&amp;#39;s just looking for a place to lick his wounds &amp;#8230; until a misunderstanding lands him doing community service in Sesty&amp;#39;s auction. Soon he finds himself standing in front of hundreds of screaming women&amp;#8212;wearing a tux and a smile. And then there&amp;#39;s Sesty&amp;#8212;looking as tempting as ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says he&amp;#39;s changed, and the sparks between them are flying fast and furious, but can Sesty trust Josh to take the wheel and drive her into the future she never dreamed possible?&lt;/p&gt;" />
