        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Claiming Her Billion-Dollar Birthright – Maureen Child&lt;br /&gt;Erica Prentice’s world is turned upside when she discovers she is a member of the wealthy Jarrod dynasty. Luckily the Jarrod family lawyer Christian Hanford is there to show her the ropes. But Erica is in for a second shock- her fiery attraction to the strictly off-limits attorney!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Falling For His Proper Mistress – Tessa Radley&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Guy Jarrod believed the rumours of Avery Lancaster’s gold-digging ways. But he still desires her like no other. So nights of passion will sate his desire and then he’ll send her on her way…. But what if the rumours were false? Had he made a mistress out of the woman who should have been his wife?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wedding His Takeover Target – Emilie Rose&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Gavin Jarrod is forced to wed Sabrina Taylor to secure a lucrative business deal, he’s up to the challenge. Especially as Sabrina is perfect in and out of the bedroom! But now she’s pregnant with his child and she wants a real father for her baby or this deal is off!&lt;/p&gt;
