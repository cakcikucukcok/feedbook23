  <title>Fortunate Harbor - Emilie Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Join five women connected only by their growing friendship and the road that runs like a lifeline between their cottages in a run-down Florida development called Happiness Key&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy Deloche&lt;/strong&gt; finally gets a chance to swap business for a romantic evening with Marsh Egan, but dinner goes cold when she spots her ex-husband prowling outside her cottage. CJ is supposed to be in prison and out of her life for good. Exactly what is this modern-day pirate seeking and what will it mean for Tracy’s future?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janya Kapur&lt;/strong&gt; envies every pregnant woman she sees, but Rishi, her husband, is suddenly reluctant to talk about children. Is he disappointed in her inability to conceive? Their marriage was a contract between strangers. Can they ever hope for anything more?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Waitress &lt;strong&gt;Wanda Gray&lt;/strong&gt; loses her job after new owners turn the Dancing Shrimp into a tapas bar. Wise neighbor &lt;em&gt;Alice Brooks&lt;/strong&gt;’s suggestion that Wanda start her own business seems like a brilliant solution, until Wanda starts Pie War I with the owners of the local bakery.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;When the empty cottage at Happiness Key is rented by single mother &lt;strong&gt;Dana Turner&lt;/strong&gt;, everything seems perfect. With Alice volunteering to watch Dana’s daughter while she works and Wanda’s offer of a job, this spit of Florida Gulf Coast land should be a fortunate harbor for a mother and daughter who have moved far too often. Except for Dana’s shocking secret.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;As the women of Happiness Key struggle to discover the truth in time to help their new neighbor, their only weapon is friendship. But will friendship be enough?" />
