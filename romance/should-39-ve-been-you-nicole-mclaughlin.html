  <title>Should&#39;ve Been You - Nicole McLaughlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Childhood neighbors get a chance at love in &lt;i&gt;Should&#39;ve Been You&lt;/i&gt;, an achingly romantic novella in Nicole McLaughlin&#39;s Man Enough series!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Guardsman Jase Beckford wants to live a quiet life raising cattle and taking care of his mother. His childhood friend and neighbor Hannah is still his best friend, but when he walks into the Walters house one morning and sees her twin sister Becca for the first time in five years, he wonders if he missed out on something special.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becca Walters has nursed a secret crush on Jase since childhood, but he always preferred Hannah, so she buried her feelings assuming her sister and Jase would one day turn their flirtation into a real relationship. And this Christmas, she is anticipating a proposal of her own, so Jase&#39;s reappearance in her life doesn&#39;t mean anything. Much. Okay, maybe more than Becca would like to admit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, when Becca&#39;s sister gets engaged to someone who&#39;s not Jase, Becca and Jase find themselves spending more together. And when secrets are revealed, suddenly those dormant feelings come back to life; but is the possibility of something between them worth risking the happiness of everyone they love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
