Dear Diary,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last time I remember writing in a diary was when I was 17 years old in high school. My last diary entry was about how at age 18, I would submit my picture to Playboy Magazine. Hell&amp;hellip;as fascinating as that all sounded at the time, once I graduated, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the heart or more accurately, the guts. You know admittedly, I was a late bloomer when it came to sex and sexual matters. But I certainly had quite the imagination, so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as prudish as all that. Anyhow, what brings me to writing in a diary now? Well&amp;hellip;I guess I have to occupy my mind at times and just get it out of my head. Look, some things you just can&amp;rsquo;t always talk about with girlfriends and certainly not with your mother. Now my issue with girlfriends is, they whine too much in my opinion. Plus, they tend to tell too much of your business, and they gossip and exaggerate the smallest things. They want a listening ear when I just don&amp;rsquo;t want to listen all the time, truth be told. So now what do they whine about? Humph, they are actually complaining about how much sex their husbands or boyfriends want from them. They talk about all the things they WON&amp;rsquo;T do&amp;hellip;that the only time they would even think to give him a blow job is if it were his birthday or their anniversary. I sit and look at say&amp;hellip;a group of three friends and all of them are shaking their heads in agreement. I think they are under the impression that I feel as they do. I mean the fact of the matter is, I LOVE having sex with my husband. While they&amp;rsquo;re whining and complaining about giving up the goods to their OWN man, I long for mine. They have their man on weekends, at night, on holidays, summer, winter, spring, fall. My husband is yet on ANOTHER business trip. Look, his job needless to say pays the bills and keeps me living comfortably at home. I mean I work when and if I want but I don&amp;rsquo;t have to. I am well cared for financially. But damn&amp;hellip;I NEED a good fuck." />
