  <title>A Night of Southern Comfort (The Boys are Back in Town Series) - Robin Covington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Night of Southern Comfort (The Boys are Back in Town Series) by Robin Covington&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One night of passion... Detective Jackson Cantrell never imagined that one night with an irresistible stranger would turn his life upside down. He&#39;s spent years living in the shadows, but Dr. Michaela Roarke awakened a passion inside him he&#39;d buried years ago. He never expected the woman would turn out to be the governor&#39;s daughter...and his next assignment. The governor blackmails Jackson to secretly watch over Michaela and protect her from a stalker, or kiss his dream job at the FBI good-bye. Swearing to keep things strictly professional, Jackson moves in with Michaela. Too bad his heart can&#39;t keep the same promise. But when the stalker&#39;s attacks quickly escalate beyond mere photographs to bodily harm, Jackson must race to save Michaela&#39;s life. And he&#39;ll have to figure out how to keep her once she discovers his lie.&lt;/p&gt;" />
