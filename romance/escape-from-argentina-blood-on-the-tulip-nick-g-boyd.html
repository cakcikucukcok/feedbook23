  <title>Escape from Argentina: Blood on the Tulip - Nick G. Boyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story involves revolution, war, and a true everlasting love. Human compassion and self-sacrifice followed by a smile in moments of agonizing death... There was an unrest in the city followed by an uprising led by the student revolutionary group; the students were valiant in their struggle; weary yet heightened, they danced, and sang victory songs. To keep their tyrannical reign, in response to the uprising, the government&#39;s long-arm, subservient military declared a curfew, and created a notorious military special-op unit to mark the leaders of the uprising for assassination...  Jean Lui is a CIA operative sent to coordinate a rescue mission in the Southern Hemisphere. He goes to Buenos Aires and helps the revolutionaries in their struggle for freedom. During the commencement of the revolution, he falls in love with Angelin, a beautiful young freedom fighter. Soon he discovers he has been used; his great love Angelin has vanished without a trace: she betrayed him as well as the revolution. Under continued threat of death, Jean Lui finally finds Angelin on the beautiful shores of Rio de Janeiro, and realizes Angelin is under the protection of the Brazilian revolutionaries. Determined to get her back, Jean Lui contacts his CIA associates in Brazil to put him in touch with underground forces for help. In a different arena, under the darkness of night, a covert arms shipment is in progress on the shores of Monte Video. War breaks out, and British and U.S. warships are engulfed in flames..." />
