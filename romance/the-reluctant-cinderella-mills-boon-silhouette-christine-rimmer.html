  <title>The Reluctant Cinderella (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Christine Rimmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Plain Jane Megan Schumacher was the most dependable person on Danbury Way, the sleek suburban cul-de-sac where she lived over her sister&#39;s garage. Certainly not the kind of girl who would rock anyone&#39;s boat–until she fell for the (barely) ex-husband of her best friend and neighbor!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Greg Banning planned to hire Megan to redo his marketing plan, but he counted the minutes until each of their meetings. As their romance heated up, Greg realized she was everything he wanted in a woman, and his thoughts began straying to marriage. But would their new love spell happiness for both of them–or would the scandal tear them apart?&lt;/p&gt;
