          &lt;strong&gt;HE WAS SEXY, POWERFUL…AND ABOUT TO PUT HER OUT OF BUSINESS!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bill Harper had to be stopped. Eloise Vale didn&#39;t care if he was the mayor of New York–he was about to cut funding to her precious birth center! He was also her once-upon-atime lover. And being whirled into his arms at the Mayor&#39;s Ball was making the single mother of triplets &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; believe in fairy tales again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bill might be the most powerful man in the city, but he yearned to be the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; man in Eloise&#39;s life. After her three sons, of course. He would show the down-to-earth widow that there was always room for negotiation–and a love that was growing stronger by the minute….&lt;/p&gt;
