      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rinnie Noelle would rather kick some creepy villain butt than go on a date. As a Psi Fighter trained in the Mental Arts, she can&#39;t be distracted by emotion. Her nemesis, Nicolaitin, is manipulating students from her school, using them as puppets to carry out his new plan to find the infamous Morgan Girl, and he doesn&#39;t care who becomes collateral damage in the process. People&#39;s lives are depending on Rinnie&#39;s ultimate focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mason Draudimon keeps slicing into her soul sharper than a Thought Saber, and her feelings for him knock her off her game with the strength of a psionic War Hammer. Mason insists on helping Rinnie take down Nicolaitan for his own reasons--to avenge his mother--and the closer they get to the truth, the more dangerous the dance between mind and heart, lifeand death, logic and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
