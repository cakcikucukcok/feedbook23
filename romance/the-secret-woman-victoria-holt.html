More of a saga-style story for me than some of her other novels, it tells the story of Anna Brett, an orphaned child sent to live with her cantankerous Aunt Charlotte, old Miss Brett, whose life and strange house is filled with the antique trade.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: The Secret Woman (Casablanca Classics ...</i></b> | The Secret Woman is a Gothic romance and suspense novel written by English author Eleanor Hibbert under the pseudonym Victoria Holt.
