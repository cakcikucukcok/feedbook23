  <title>Snowy Mountain Nights (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) - Lindsay Evans</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Cold nights. Hot kisses… &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On a much-needed ski getaway with her girlfriends, the last person Reyna Allen wants to run into is the lawyer who ruined her life. The tattoo artist&#39;s bitter divorce left her with nothing, and she blames her ex-husband&#39;s attorney, Garrison Richards. Now firelight dinners, winter walks in the Adirondacks and toe-curling chemistry are daring her to give in to the one man she refuses to ever trust.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Garrison is good at his job–and where Reyna&#39;s concerned, he may have been a little too good. He regrets the role he played in her divorce and intends to show Reyna that he&#39;s found his moral compass since then. But as their mutual heat thaws her resolve, will doubts put the freeze on their relationship–before he can convince her that &lt;em&gt;they&#39;re&lt;/em&gt; the ones meant for happily -ever-after?&lt;/p&gt;
