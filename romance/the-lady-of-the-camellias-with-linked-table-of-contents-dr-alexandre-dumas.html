  <title>The Lady of the Camellias: With Linked Table of Contents - Dr Alexandre Dumas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;The Lady of the Camellias&#39; is a novel by Alexandre Dumas, subsequently adapted for the stage (becoming known as &#39;Camille&#39; in the English-speaking world), and then becoming the opera &#39;La Traviata.&#39; The title character is based on Marie Duplessis, the real-life lover of Dumas. In this tale, a young provincial bourgeois, Armand, falls in love with a &#39;courtisane&#39; named Marguerite, and ultimately becomes her lover, convincing her to turn her back on her life as a &#39;courtisane&#39; and live with him in the countryside. This idyllic existence is broken by Armand&#39;s father, who, concerned by the scandal created by the illicit relationship and fearful that it will destroy his daughter&#39;s (Armand&#39;s sister&#39;s) chances of marriage, convinces Marguerite to leave Armand, who believes, up until Marguerite&#39;s death, that she has left him for another man." />
