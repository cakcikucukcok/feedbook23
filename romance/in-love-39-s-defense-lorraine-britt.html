  <title>In Love&#39;s Defense - Lorraine Britt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wilson Jasper McLaglen IV inherits three things when he loses his parents...his father&#39;s partnership in the law firm he helped build, the stately Southern home he grew up in and the family&#39;s distillery.  To the outside world it seems like he has it all.  Except someone to share it with.  Elyse Gibbs inherits two things when she loses her parents...a mountain of debt and her little brother.  To the first year law school student, both are overwhelming...and it&#39;s a losing battle she is fighting alone.  When Wil McLaglen literally knocks her off her feet, it seems he could be the answer to her prayers.  Instead she&#39;s too proud, too headstrong, and she pushes him away.  Will she let her pride get in the way of her heart?  Wil wants to give her a future, to make her dreams come true, to give her a family.  Now if she could only realize she truly is his dream, that her dreams are his dreams...if she could only let him make those dreams a reality, for them all." />
