  <title>Rhinestone Flip Flops - Ari Dean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Josie Borday, a mid-thirties data-entry clerk, agrees to a blind date with Brett Becker, a mid-thirties construction worker, as a final effort to placate the friends who constantly try to find happiness for her. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Josie has decided that after the date ends, so, too will her efforts to complete her life with the likes of astranger.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She&#39;s become pessimistic about finding &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; Her hilarious introspection draws the reader in and makes them root for Josie as she &quot;Tries one more time.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Much to her surprise (andthat of everyone pulling for her), the date is a success. With a mixture of uncertainty, comedy, some drama and, of course, romance, Josie has landed in a comfortable, happy place. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Josie and Brett embark on a journey neither of them expected. Their time together is unpredictable, spontaneous, flirty, and fun. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unexpected twists and turns (that even they don&#39;t see coming) help make their budding relationship strong and resilient from the moment they meet.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This is a story filled with hilarious, heartwarming moments, and is sure to be enjoyed by readers from 18 to 108! The twist in the story makes it one that will stick with the reader and, perhaps, get them thinking about how they approach living, laughing and loving. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
