  <title>Too Hot to Sleep (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - Stephanie Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Nurse Georgia Adams can&#39;t sleep–and it&#39;s got nothing to do with the local heat wave. She&#39;s got a lukewarm boyfriend, a nonexistent love life–and she&#39;s frustrated, really frustrated. So she decides to take the edge off by calling her boyfriend for a little phone flirtation–and a lot more! Only, she doesn&#39;t realize she&#39;s dialed the wrong number!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Police officer Ken Medlock can&#39;t sleep, either-his libido is in overdrive thanks to his sexy midnight caller. He&#39;s captivated by her voice–and when he meets and recognizes her the next day, he realizes he has to have her in his bed-not at the end of his phone line. But first he has to convince Georgia that her wrong number has turned into a very right connection…&lt;/p&gt;
