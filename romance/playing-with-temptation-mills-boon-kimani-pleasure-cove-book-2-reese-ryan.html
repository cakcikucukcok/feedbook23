  <title>Playing With Temptation (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (Pleasure Cove, Book 2) - Reese Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A love for all time&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;North Carolina pro-footballer Nate Johnston built his reputation on talent, drive, and good sportsmanship. But a devastating recent loss derails his team’s shot of winning the championship . . . and Nate’s career when a compromising video goes viral. In need of a miracle, the star wide receiver feels ambushed when his brother enlists media consultant Kendra Williams to do damage control. The reignited desire for the woman he once wanted to spend forever with can only cause Nate deeper heartache.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Walking away from the man she loved seven years ago is the biggest regret of Kendra’s life. Now her son needs a closer relationship with his father. . . and Kendra needs to win back Nate’s trust. After breaking his heart, repairing his career is the least she could do to help save his dream. Powerful passion still smolders between them, tempting the former lovers to move beyond their painful past. Will the emergence of a jealous ex with a vicious revenge scheme sabotage their second chance at a future and family that’s almost within reach?&lt;/p&gt;
