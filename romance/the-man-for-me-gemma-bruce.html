  <title>The Man For Me - Gemma Bruce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Squeeze Play&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bragging. The pin-ups. The sweaty socks. &lt;i&gt;Please oh please, set me free!&lt;/i&gt; Female sportswriter J.T. Green wants out of the locker room--until star pitcher Tommy Bainbridge walks in.   Tommy defines the word hot: He&#39;s tall, a terrific kisser, and a total catch. J.T. wants everything he has to give. But Gilbeytown, PA, needs their hometown boy back where he belongs and if his plans to help get leaked to the press, there&#39;s going to be hell to pay. Distracting a woman as determined and downright sexy as J.T. isn&#39;t going to be easy. Unless he can show her how heavenly it feels to be held in his powerful arms and.  .  .well, hey. She seems to like it. A lot. And so does Tommy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It&#39;s clear as a freshly chalked baseline that Tommy and J.T. are crazy in love. To hell with reality. They don&#39;t care if they never come back .  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Gemma Bruce and her novels.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sexy comedy with romance that sizzles the pages!&quot; &amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times,&lt;/i&gt; 4 star review of &lt;i&gt;Who Loves Ya, Baby?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Smart dialogue and sassy heroines make this provocative collection shine.&quot;&amp;#8211;&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times, &lt;/i&gt; 4 star review of &lt;i&gt;Who&#39;s Been Sleeping In My Bed?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gemma Bruce&lt;/b&gt; is the alter ego of a popular mystery writer, who loves the excitement of a &quot;who done it&quot; and the sizzle of romance. After a career in dance, theater, television and film, performing before packed houses even on a bad-hair-bloat day, Gemma now goes one on one with her computer screen to create the characters and stories she loves. Her laptop has never once made a snide remark about her hair (although it has eaten a few sentences that made it blush)." />
