  <title>Waking Up Alive - Emma Shortt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;They&#39;re running for their lives...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After surviving the zombie apocalypse for two years, Tye LeBow never expected to be saved from a hungry gang of zombies by a geek with a bad attitude and a penchant for explosives. Tye can&#39;t quite work out why scientist Polly Parker saved him. She doesn&#39;t want his protection, and she certainly doesn&#39;t want his company. But Tye has no intention of leaving the beguiling geek behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Polly doesn&#39;t want to leave her home, but when the wakers begin to show signs of a burgeoning intelligence, heading south is the only option. With a car packed full of homemade explosives, and Tye&#39;s very large axe, they are ready for the road trip of their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bombs and blades aren&#39;t the only keys to survival-they&#39;ll need to rely on each other, in a way that neither could have imagined...&lt;/p&gt;" />
