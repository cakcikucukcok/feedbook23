  <title>Playing Dirty (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Susan Andersen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When old enemies are thrown together, all bets are off…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Way back in high school, golden boy Cade Gallari publicly revealed he&#39;d slept with &quot;fat girl&quot; Ava Spencer to win a bet. Now a decade older and a head turner with her own concierge business, Ava isn&#39;t the gullible dreamer she once was– and she plans to prove it when Cade, hotter than ever, breezes back into town with an offer she can&#39;t refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A documentary film producer, Cade is shooting a movie about the mysterious mansion Ava inherited. And he wants &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; as his personal concierge. She&#39;s certainly professional enough to be at his beck and call without giving him everything he wants. Like another shot at having her in his bed. But Ava doesn&#39;t count on Cade&#39;s determination. Because he&#39;s never gotten over her– and he&#39;s not above playing dirty to score a second chance at a red&amp;#150;hot future…&lt;/p&gt;
