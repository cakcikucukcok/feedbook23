  <title>One Day in Apple Grove - C.H. Admirand</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to Apple Grove, Ohio (population 597), where everyone has your best interests at heart, even if they can&#39;t agree on the best way to meddle. When the townsfolk of Apple Grove need handiwork done, there&#39;s no job too small for the Mulcahy sisters: Megan, Caitlin, and Grace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caitlin Mulcahy loves her family. She really does. But sometimes they can drive her to her last shred of sanity—from her dad (&quot;I&#39;m not meddling, I just want what&#39;s best for you&quot;) to her eight-months-pregnant older sister to her younger sister, who will do just about anything to avoid real work. Cait just needs to get away, even if for only an hour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she sees someone in need of help on the side of the road, of course she&#39;s going to pull over. She might even be able to fix his engine—after all, the Mulcahy family is a handy bunch. She&#39;s not expecting that former Navy medic Jack Gannon and a little black puppy named Jameson will be the ones who end up rescuing in her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Grove series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; A Wedding in Apple Grove&lt;br&gt; One Day in Apple Grove&lt;br&gt;Welcome Back to Apple Grove&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Praise for C.H.
