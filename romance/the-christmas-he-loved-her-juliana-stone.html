  <title>The Christmas He Loved Her - Juliana Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All he wants this Christmas is her...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the small town of Crystal Lake, Christmas is a time for sledding, hot chocolate, and cozying up to the fire with those you love. For Jake Edwards, it&#39;s also time to come home and face the music. He thought there would never be anything harder than losing his brother. Turns out there is: falling in love with his brother&#39;s widow, Raine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since they were little, Jesse was the Edwards brother who was always there for her, and Jake was the one who knew just how to push her buttons. Raine can&#39;t imagine a life without them, which is why it was doubly decimating when Jake left town after his brother&#39;s sudden death. Now he&#39;s back and she doesn&#39;t know whether to be mad or thrilled. Maybe both. Or maybe it will be the perfect chance for both of them to finally find happiness again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad Boys of Crystal Lake series:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Summer He Came Home&lt;br&gt; The Christmas He Loved Her&lt;br&gt; The Day He Kissed Her&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Will appeal to readers of Cathie Linz and Susan Elizabeth Phillips.&quot;—&lt;em&gt;Booklist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All he wants this Christmas is her...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the small town of Crystal Lake, Christmas is a time for sledding, hot chocolate, and cozying up to the fire with those you love.
