He might seem a little too interested in the McKettrick money, but Lizzie&#39;s certain Whitley cares for her deep down. But &lt;em&gt;fate&lt;/em&gt; has a surprise for Lizzie&amp;#151;Dr. Morgan Shane. When their train is stranded by a massive avalanche on Christmas Eve the handsome doctor takes charge&amp;#151;with Lizzie by his side. Time&#39;s running out for the passengers. But with faith, hard work and some unexpected help, it just might be a joyous McKettrick family Christmas after all&amp;#133;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Creed Country Christmas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the Montana wilderness of 1910, Lincoln Creed is up against more than rustlers, wolves and winter storms. His young daughter, Gracie, has needs beyond the beans and bacon he can barely cook. The widowed rancher must find Gracie a suitable governess who won&#39;t set her sights on him. Disowned for her refusal to marry, the young schoolteacher Juliana Mitchell seems like a perfect fit in the Creed home. As she gets to know Lincoln and Gracie, Juliana suddenly doesn&#39;t feel so strongly against marriage after all. In the season of miracles, Providence just might find a way to bring these souls together in a wonderful Christmas blessing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
