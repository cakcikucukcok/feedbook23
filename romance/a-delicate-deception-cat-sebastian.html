  <title>A Delicate Deception - Cat Sebastian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Amelia Allenby escaped a stifling London ballroom for the quiet solitude of the Derbyshire countryside, the very last thing she wanted was an extremely large, if&amp;#8212;she grudgingly admits&amp;#8212;passably attractive man disturbing her daily walks. Lecturing the surveyor about property rights doesn&amp;#8217;t work and, somehow, he has soon charmed his way into lemon cakes, long walks, and dangerously heady kisses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very last place Sydney wished to be was in the shadow of the ruins of Pelham Hall, the inherited property that stole everything from him. But as he awaits his old friend, the Duke of Hereford, he finds himself increasingly captivated by the maddeningly lovely and exceptionally odd Amelia. He quickly finds that keeping his ownership of Pelham Hall a secret is as impossible as keeping himself from falling in love with her.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when the Duke of Hereford arrives, Sydney&amp;#8217;s ruse is revealed and what started out as a delicate deception has become a love too powerful to ignore. Will they let a lifetime of hurt come between them or can these two lost souls find love and peace in each other?&lt;/p&gt;" />
