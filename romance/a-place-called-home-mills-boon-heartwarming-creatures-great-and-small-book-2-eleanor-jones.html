            &lt;em&gt;You can take the woman out of the country…&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Ellie Nelson traded life in rural England for the big city, she left painful memories behind. Coming home to Little Dale means getting back in touch with nature and the animals that inspire her. And a local wildlife vet could even help the fledgling painter realize her dreams. Except he&#39;s the one who broke her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Andy Montgomery has to tread with caution. He can&#39;t put the creatures he&#39;s sworn to protect at risk. And Ellie isn&#39;t ready to trust him again. He doesn&#39;t blame her - he still hasn&#39;t told her his biggest secret. Once he does, will Ellie leave their close-knit community forever?&lt;/p&gt;
