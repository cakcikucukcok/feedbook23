  <title>Throwing Heat - Jennifer Seasons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sexy baseball players of Jennifer Seasons&amp;#39; Diamonds and Dugouts series slide into home with a final fiery romance worthy of a World Series win.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nightclub manager Leslie Cutter has never been one to back down from a bet. So when Peter Kowalskin, pitcher for the Denver Rush baseball team, bets her that she can&amp;#39;t keep her hands off of him, she&amp;#39;s not about to let the arrogant, gorgeous playboy win. Especially when the prize could put her business on the map. She&amp;#39;s got this in the bag, just so long as she can stay out of his arms &amp;#8230; and his bed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter struck out once before with Leslie, but this bet is sure to be the second chance he&amp;#39;s been waiting for. Determined to stoke the passion he knows is there, he&amp;#39;ll do anything to win&amp;#8212;even if it means playing a little dirty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as things heat up, this combustible pair will have to decide just how much they&amp;#39;re willing to wager on one another &amp;#8230; and on a future that just might last forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
