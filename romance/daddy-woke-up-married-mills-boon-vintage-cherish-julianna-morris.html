        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HIS&lt;/em&gt; EXPECTING WIFE?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There were holes in the wedding pictures where his face should be, and his wife lived in a separate apartment! Something about Nick Carleton&#39;s marriage was wrong. Unfortunately, he had lost his memory and didn&#39;t remember what &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; was.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He only knew that beautiful, sexy and &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; pregnant Emily Carleton was his wife–everyone told him so. But each time Nick tried to stir up the matrimonial passions between them, Emily ran away. If it wasn&#39;t for the brief flashes of fire in her eyes when he kissed her, Nick would almost think his wife had never shared a bedroom with him before….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Bundles of Joy. Sometimes small packages can lead to the biggest surprises!&lt;/strong&gt;
