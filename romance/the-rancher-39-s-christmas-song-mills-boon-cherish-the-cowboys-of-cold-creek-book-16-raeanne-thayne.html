  <title>The Rancher&#39;s Christmas Song (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (The Cowboys of Cold Creek, Book 16) - RaeAnne Thayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Keep a song in your heart this holiday season… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Music teacher Ella Baker&#39;s plate is already full. But when single dad Beckett McKinley&#39;s wild twin boys need help preparing a Christmas song for their father, Ella agrees on one condition: they teach her to ride a horse. She&#39;s hoping that&#39;ll help mend her strained relationship with her rancher father; it certainly has nothing to do with the crush that&#39;s lingered since her one and only date with Beck.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It isn&#39;t disinterest spurring Beck to keep his distance – if anything, the spark is too strong, with Ella reminding him of his ex-wife. Soon what started as an innocent arrangement is beginning to feel a lot like family. But with the holidays approaching, Beck and Ella will have to overcome past hurts if they want to keep each other warm this Christmas…&lt;/p&gt;
