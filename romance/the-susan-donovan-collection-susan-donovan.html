  <title>The Susan Donovan Collection - Susan Donovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fall in love all over again with this delightfully sexy bundle of New York Times bestselling author Susan Donovan novels, including &lt;i&gt;The Kept Woman, Knock Me Off My Feet, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;He Loves Lucy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Kept Woman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Down on her luck Samantha Monroe is dealing with an AWOL ex-husband, maxed out credit cards, and the task of raising three children on a hairstylist&#39;s salary. It&#39;s time for a new game plan. When Sam learns that politician Jack Tolliver needs someone to play the part of his fiancée for six months in return for a generous paycheck, she&#39;s ready to sign up on the spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack needs Sam and her kids to help tone down his image from womanizing cad to dependable dad. But he was expecting Sam to be a frumpy single mom, not a wickedly smart, sexy redhead. Keeping nosey newshounds from discovering that his engagement is a charade is going to be a tough job, but with the sparks flying between them, and their nights getting hotter, maybe their game of make-believe is about to spill over into real life...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Knock Me Off My Feet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Autumn Adams has always been an independent woman, but when a dangerous man begins to stalk her, she&#39;s out to find a little protection of her own.  And when that protection comes in the form of the smoldering, handsome detective Stacey Quinn, he brings a very different kind of danger into her life...and her heart...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinn soon discovers that protecting Audie is the craziest, hottest, and sexiest bit of detective work he&#39;s ever had the pleasure of doing.  And even though he knows he is here to protect her, he&#39;s also ready to have her...forever...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;He Loves Lucy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marketing exec Lucy Cunningham is thrilled when her firm lands The Palm Club account. The campaign concept for Miami&#39;s hottest fitness club was Lucy&#39;s idea: take one fitness-challenged woman, put her in front of TV cameras, and into the hands of the club&#39;s top personal trainer, Theo Redmond. It seems like a brilliant idea-until Lucy gets picked to be the guinea pig. It&#39;s stressful enough she has to put down the pizza and start the Pilates - and when she meets Theo in person, she&#39;s a whole different kind of bothered...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Theo has never met a woman quite like Lucy.  Smart-mouthed and stubborn, it&#39;s clear she isn&#39;t fond of marching to anyone&#39;s drumbeat but her own.  It isn&#39;t long before the simmering tension between them bursts into flames, and Theo learns that when it comes to love and desire, the last thing that matters is size...&lt;/p&gt;" />
