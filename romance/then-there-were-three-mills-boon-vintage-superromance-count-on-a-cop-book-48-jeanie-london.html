  <title>Then There Were Three (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) (Count on a Cop, Book 48) - Jeanie London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Talk about being sucker punched. The runaway kid sitting in Police Chief Nic DiLeo&#39;s chair with her feet propped up on his desk belongs to his family–no doubt about it. But her father isn&#39;t one of his five brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s him. She&#39;s his daughter with Megan Bell.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nic was crazy about Megan in high school…until she vanished from his life with no explanation. The bigger secret, however, isn&#39;t the daughter he didn&#39;t know. It&#39;s Megan and how he &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; feels about her. She&#39;s more beautiful now and even more of a temptation. Suddenly the man who wanted to drop commitments is looking for ways to tie himself to Megan…permanently!&lt;/p&gt;
