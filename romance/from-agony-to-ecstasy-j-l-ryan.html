  <title>From Agony To Ecstasy - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I&amp;#39;m Sierra. Why do I keep scraping the bottom of the barrel when it comes to men? If I go out with one more sleazeball, I&amp;#39;m going to die. Maybe I shouldn&amp;#39;t be too picky, though. I&amp;#39;m 90 pounds overweight, broke, and desperate for a baby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the first time I laid my eyes on his chiseled abs, sky blue eyes, and gorgeous smile, I was hooked. I can barely catch my breath when I see him, and I&amp;#39;m falling in lust with him from afar. Being in lust is fine. Being in love might be okay, but only on my terms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;m A.J. I&amp;#39;ve always had to fight my way to the top, but I made it because I&amp;#39;ve got guts. I run my business like a crazy person. That&amp;#39;s how I made my first billion at such a young age.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There&amp;#39;s nothing I can&amp;#39;t have. Gorgeous women with hot bodies throw themselves at me, but there&amp;#39;s only one problem. I&amp;#39;m not interested. My secret is....I&amp;#39;m only attracted to fat girls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;ve never wanted anything that was too easy for me to obtain. That includes women. I can possess anything and anyone, but not Sierra. She&amp;#39;s the only woman who doesn&amp;#39;t throw herself at me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;m obsessed with her and those lucious curves. I can&amp;#39;t help myself. I&amp;#39;m falling in love. I would give anything if she loved me back. My need for her dominates my every thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why doesn&amp;#39;t she want to be seen with me? I&amp;#39;m a popular bad boy, and all the girls want me. Could it be that her pathetic ex-boyfriend just moved back to town? She just needs to give me a chance. What could go wrong?&lt;br /&gt;
