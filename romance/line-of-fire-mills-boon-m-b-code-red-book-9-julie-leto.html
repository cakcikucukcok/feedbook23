They&#39;re adversaries in the courtroom and out–in spite of their often sexually charged exchanges. Now Adam&#39;s convinced she was the target, and that the shooter may strike again. Despite her protests, he&#39;s out to find the gunman. And until he does, Adam isn&#39;t about to let her go…&lt;/p&gt;
