  <title>Murphy Park - Mary Ann Fields Whitehead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Small town, southern girl, Clair Christopher, leaves her home in Natchez,Mississippi to escape the pain of being jilted at the altar by her fianc. She travels to Los Angeles and unexpectedly finds a new love in the person of Mack Fielding,
a rock-star of the We Are the World, 1985 music era. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fate throws the two strangers together when Clair, jogging in the park, is chased by an unknown man and ends up in the path of Macks car. When he insists that she move into his home to recouperate from the accident, they slowly fall in love. Fear of rejection keeps both of them from admitting their feelings to one another. When the two finally come together it is when Mack fears he may have lost Clair to another man. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Their love may be eternal and their passion endless, but staying together as a couple proves to be quite difficult. Although Clair is unconditionally accepted by Macks father, Big Jake Fielding, himself a famous actor, she is scorned by Macks possessive housekeeper, Cassie Leonard, whose fl ashing green eyes hide a secret that could destroy the young lovers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Will their love be enough to keep them together as Mack attempts to protect Clair from a stalker whose mental abuse threatens to drive her mad and shatter their lives forever, and whose physical attack could very well end her life?" />
