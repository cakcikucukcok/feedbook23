  <title>The Protectors &amp; Other Stories - Nasir Mahmood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This collection of short stories takes its title from one of the stories contained in it: The Protectors. All stories are basically romantic in nature, but they are not simple love stories. Their themes have all the colours, and their myriad shades, to afford you a panoramic view of the world we live in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first story, for example, is that of a boy whose rebellious nature, not accepting the norms of a corrupt society, struggles to achieve a job on the basis of his qualification, and not on the recommendation of a friend. Another story deals in defence of the motherland from the vicious attack of a rival force. Then there is a story which gives a graphic picture of a poverty-stricken housing scheme where women, forgetting about their self-respect, stoop so low as to adopt a life style, both execrable and pitiable but there are women and there are women!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In brief, the book touches on unemployment, indignity of a religious family, and inheritance inciting to murder. A story each describes the horrendous custom of doing away with female foetuses, the ugly face of feudalism, and foundering efforts of a courtesan to escape to a righteous life. Last but not least is the story of educated youth, who for want of any reasonable job, resort to robbery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book takes you along on a journey which unravels a picture of unspeakable misery some people are subjected to. One would feel the milk of human kindness is drying up fast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could read these stories with a view to killing time, but if they pause and think well, that is exactly what these stories are aimed at.&lt;/p&gt;" />
