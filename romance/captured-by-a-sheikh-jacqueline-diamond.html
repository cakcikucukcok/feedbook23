        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For Holly Rivers, giving her sister&#39;s baby a home and a father were her only priorities. So a marriage of convenience seemed the only solution–until a sensual stranger stole her and baby Ben and conquered her body and soul!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The red-haired siren raising his son wasn&#39;t what Sheikh Sharif Al-Khalil had expected, nor was the white-hot passion that consumed them both. But love was a luxury he couldn&#39;t afford–Sharif&#39;s enemies had followed him from his homeland, threatening Holly and his child. Now Sharif was in a race against time–but could he save his son at the expense of Holly&#39;s life?&lt;/p&gt;
