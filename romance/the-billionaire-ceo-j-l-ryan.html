  <title>The Billionaire CEO - J.l. Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Curvy girl Chloe&amp;#39;s self-confidence is shot to hell. She scrapes the bottom of the barrel when it comes to guys, and if she goes out with one unemployed sociopath living in his parents&amp;#39; basement, she&amp;#39;ll go nuts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe she shouldn&amp;#39;t be too picky, though. She&amp;#39;s 100 pounds overweight, broke, and desperate for a baby, and she&amp;#39;s so fat that she can barely breathe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she meets billionaire CEO Braden, she&amp;#39;s turned off. While he&amp;#39;s nice enough, she gets a cocky vibe from him. He&amp;#39;s a rich professional bike racer, who runs his empire like a crazy person. Gorgeous women throw themselves at him all the time, but he&amp;#39;s rarely interested.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When things come too easy for him, as they often do, he quickly loses interest. When he sees plus size Chloe for the first time, his heart skips a beat. She&amp;#39;s not like the hot models he&amp;#39;s used to dating, but there&amp;#39;s something about her big beautiful body that makes him sweat.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;#39;s naive and innocent, and wants nothing to do with him. He needs to get his hands on her delectable curves right now, or someone will suffer the consequences...&lt;br /&gt;
