  <title>Once Upon A Mattress (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - Kathleen O&#39;Reilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;If there&#39;s one thing Hilary Sinclair knows, it&#39;s how to make a bed. Well, okay, a mattress.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As an executive at MacAllister Beds, she&#39;s new to the company, but she can manufacture with the best of them. Besides, it&#39;s a fresh start in a fresh city. The last thing she needs is trouble, and when her Victorian fixer-upper is anything but, she camps out at the factory looking for a dry place to crash. Trouble strikes, though, when she winds up with a strange bedfellow!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ben MacAllister has rushed back to Dallas to help at the family&#39;s mattress company. But he can&#39;t believe the bed he makes for himself once he gets there! To start with, he can&#39;t figure out Hilary Sinclair–she&#39;s as uptight and as sexy as they come. Hilary has made it clear that she&#39;s not interested. Fine with him–he doesn&#39;t want to get distracted now. As director of security, Ben has to find out who&#39;s been sleeping in the test center–he figures the best way &lt;em&gt;is to sleep there himself!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
