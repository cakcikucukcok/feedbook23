          &lt;strong&gt;GOING BACK… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After her divorce was finalized, Elisabeth McCartney felt adrift, lost. So she decided to escape to her centuries-old family home. People in Pine River had said the house was haunted, but Elisabeth never believed them. Until one night when she heard the voice of a child.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She followed the voice…all the way back to 1892. Elisabeth wasn’t prepared to be thrust into a Victorian world. Nor was she prepared for the emotional pull she felt for widower, Jonathan Fortner and his daughter, Trista. And yet Elisabeth knew she didn’t belong in his time and they could never be together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She also knew that tragedy was in Jonathan and Trista’s future. If she stayed in the past, she could save them. But would that mean that they were destined to be separated by time?&lt;/p&gt;
