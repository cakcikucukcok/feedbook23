        &lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of Maeve Binchy&#39; - &lt;em&gt;Candis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Rancher Lonny Ellison has never known a woman like Joy Fuller. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For one thing, she doesn&#39;t seem very interested in him, and as a former rodeo cowboy, Lonny&#39;s not used to that. Women mobbed the Wyoming Kid during his rodeo days! And another thing. He and Joy — who&#39;s a schoolteacher and his sister Letty&#39;s best friend — seem to argue constantly. But it doesn&#39;t matter, does it? Because he&#39;s not interested in Joy, either.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Wait a minute. Maybe he is. At least, that&#39;s what Letty seems to think their arguments are all about. Yup, she might have a point there. Now he has to convince Joy that marriage to the Wyoming Kid will be as exciting as an eight-second bull ride and as sweet as the cookies she loves to bake.&lt;/p&gt;
