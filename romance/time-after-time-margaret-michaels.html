Your book was wonderful! It was mysterious, romantic, and I could not put it down. I am so impressed with your imagination and ability to weave this story together. Your dialogue was consistent with each character. I do a lot of reading and I see some Alice Hoffman and VC Andrews in your writing. Congratulations on a successful piece of writing! &lt;br&gt;
