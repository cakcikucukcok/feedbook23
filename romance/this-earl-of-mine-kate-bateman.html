Even worse than the &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s lecherous fortune hunters, however, is the cruel cousin determined to force Georgie into marriage. If only she could find a way to be . . . widowed? Georgie hatches a madcap scheme to wed a condemned criminal before he&#39;s set to be executed.

Georgie doesn&#39;t realize who he is when she marries him--and she most certainly never expects to bump into her very-much-alive, and very handsome, husband of convenience at a society gathering weeks later. Soon Wylde finds himself courting his own wife, hoping to win her heart since he already has her hand. But how can this seductive rogue convince brazen, beautiful Georgie that he wants to be together...until &lt;i&gt;actual &lt;/i&gt;death do they part?&lt;/p&gt;" />
