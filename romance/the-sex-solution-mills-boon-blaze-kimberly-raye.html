  <title>The Sex Solution (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) - Kimberly Raye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Madeline Hale has come back to her Texas hometown on a mission. Twelve years ago, she&#39;d been a chubby bookworm infatuated with bad boy Austin Jericho.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She still has the brains–after all, she&#39;s chief chemist for a cosmetics company–but now she also has the body and attitude to match. And she plans to use them–along with a new aphrodisiac lotion she&#39;s created–to finally get Austin where he belongs–in her bed….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Austin doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s hit him. He&#39;s wanted Maddie forever, but he always figured she was too good for him. Only suddenly, the tables have turned. The sweet girl has turned into a sex siren, and Austin has ditched his wicked ways to settle down with a nice little wife.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Maddie smells so sweet, feels so soft and tastes so wonderful. There&#39;s only one solution. The Sex Solution. And it&#39;s going to be very, very good….&lt;/p&gt;
